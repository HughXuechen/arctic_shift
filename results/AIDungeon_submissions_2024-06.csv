I have tried making GPT RPG dungeon masters, and just using ChatGPT regular chat for stories & the results I get from both ChatGPT & AI Dungeon ChatGPT are almost the same. The context is mega for ChatGPT as well, so it pretty much never forgets anything you tell it.

  
IMO ChatGPT is not very creative (vs Wizard or Llama) and it's also very restrictive. 

  
Thoughts? Or any advice on how to make better use of ChatGPT on AI Dungeon?

Checking in to see if anyone else has this issue. It doesn't matter what scenario it is, but any scenario that has a character creation section before launching (one example: Faerûn) seems to crash the app (the screen turns black and I have to kill the app and start over).

I'm on iOS. There's no rhyme or reason to when it crashes, but it seems to happen more when there are a few options or more that requiring scrolling on the pages. Sometimes if I'm quick enough with the options I can get through, but the rate of success is low.

Now though, to my surprise, I find that Mixtral gets constantly stuck. And not only on phrasings but in the same direction of the plot line.

I understand it does not know what a plot line is, but it simply won't generate anything new, recycling the same lines of text over and over and no amount of retries or tantrums in AI Instructions/Authors Notes/Temperature, help in that regard. Unless you edit the Author's Note before every new generation in a precise way, it does not seem to work at all. Also tried different scenarios, old and new, with different sets of Instructions in them. The whole repetition thing might be even worse than with the free bots.

The only way to unstuck the model and force it to generate anything new is to insert a divider like:

>STOP SAYING HOW PROUD I AM OF MYSELF!

Or something equally dumb. But! It means it is actually possible. Temperature sometimes work, but more likely to make it fly off the rails and into the mushroom forest... or noticeably drop the quality of the writing.

Yes, it is unlikely for the bot to generate something outside the already provided context, but it almost never throws in anything new, so it's a frustrating experience of nonstop editing.

So, am I missing something? Are there any other tricks to make it not sound like a broken record at every hundred words and make it drop repeating parasitic lines above or below the new content, like:

-Character walks down the corridor, immensely proud of himself. The sun is shining.  
-The immensely proud of himself Character enters the cafeteria. The air is still.  
-The next day, in the morning, the character remembers a dream about being oh so immensely proud of himself. The weather is sunny again.

I've got GPT4all and their models are actually often very flexible with retries... I think.

* Fixed an issue where you couldn’t type more than one letter at a time in a Plot Component when the input box was open in the game screen. This has been hot-fixed in Beta as well.
* Fixed an issue where child Scenarios of Multiple Choice Scenarios were not always properly auto-saving
* Fixed an issue where editing your characters’ name through the flame icon menu in the game screen could cut off the text field. Known Issue: This still may not work in the Android mobile app.
* Fixed an issue where sharing a generated image from the game screen would result in a broken link
* Fixed an issue where Author's Note was incorrectly triggering Story Cards
* Fixed an issue on iOS where you couldn’t delete Story Cards because the deletion confirmation popup wasn’t shown
* Fixed an issue in the mobile apps where Story Cards were a bit squished
* Fixed an issue in the mobile apps where Story Card search was hidden behind the tabs when editing an Adventure or Scenario
* Fixed an issue in the mobile apps where switching between tabs while editing an Adventure or Scenario could sometimes cause odd behavior
* The “Stable” Release Channel in the mobile apps should now be renamed to “Production” in all places it was previously called Stable
* Enabled the ability for free players in a Multiplayer game to see Memories in the Context Viewer when present if the premium host has the Memory Bank enabled

I got Legend for a month back in January and was very impressed with 8k memory and mixtral (besides the repeating phrases and wordiness)

I’m happy to stick to 8k memory, but might switch to legend if the new memory system takes up space, or if there’s a huge difference between 16k and 8k.

We’d like to share several changes we’ll be making to improve how you can share and discover content in AI Dungeon.

## Why we’re making these changes

Although AI Dungeon was inspired by Dungeons and Dragons and has a strong representation of RPG players, you can create stories and adventures across any genre. You all have embraced this flexibility and created content on AI Dungeon that spans various genres, fictional universes, writing styles, and more. As our community has grown, many of you have shared an interest in having the content shown to you on AI Dungeon better reflect your own preferences.

In an ideal world, we’d follow the path of social platforms that build advanced personalization algorithms, invest in robust moderation teams, and create custom first-party content for their users. Perhaps one day, we will be able to have similar solutions. Today, we’re still a small team, and we have to look for creative solutions within the constraints we have as a company. 

We’ve received lots of feedback that we could do better. User interviews with new players revealed that the content they saw on the home page made them question whether they would feel comfortable in the AI Dungeon community. Some of you have shared that our SFW category still has content that you find objectionable. Many of us at Latitude are parents, and we’d love to have our kids play AI Dungeon without worrying about the content they could be exposed to. Creators have been frustrated that their content won’t be featured on the home page if it’s labeled as NSFW. 

At times, we’ve been tempted to make quick changes to address each of these problems. We’ve learned that interventions can have unintended consequences, so we wanted to take our time and be thoughtful with any adjustments.

We want to take a first step toward better supporting your content preferences. We hope that this is the first of many improvements, and we hope that one day, AI Dungeon can be fully personalized to you.

## New Content Rating System

To address many of these issues and improve how players discover content we’ll be introducing a new content rating system into AI Dungeon. We’ve chosen to use a modified version of the ESRB rating system to add more granularity to the ratings of content published on AI Dungeon. 

The new ratings will be Everyone, Teen, Mature, and Unrated. Some content will still be considered unpublishable, as defined by our Community Guidelines.

We chose to model after the ESRB ratings since it’s a rating system commonly used by other games, and the definitions are more widely understood than those for SFW/NSFW labels. This should enable creators to have an easier time labeling their content with the appropriate rating and help players more easily understand what each content rating means.

### Changing Content Ratings

The content rating can be edited in the Details panel of your Adventure or Scenario. You’ll see a new section called Content Rating and a dropdown menu to select the appropriate rating. You can reference our Guidebook Article to help you decide which rating is appropriate for your content. Our community and moderation team is also happy to answer any questions you have about the new categories. 

Unless you select a different rating, all published content will be defaulted to the Unrated category.

### Transition Plan

While we’re transitioning to the new system, both the new system (based on ESRB ratings) and the old SFW/NSFW label will be displayed when editing or publishing a scenario or adventure. For now, the new content ratings won’t impact the visibility of the content on search, home page, or profiles. Other players will not be able to see the rating. We encourage you to start using this new content rating in preparation for other changes coming to AI Dungeon, which weʻll explain below. 

All existing content will be marked as Unrated. We invite all of you to update your existing published content with a new content rating. Because there isnʻt a clear mapping from our old system to new, all content will need to be manually updated with our new rating system. Our team will also be reviewing and updating content to help with this effort. 

After we’ve given you all time to update your content ratings, the NSFW label will be removed and we’ll use the new content ratings going forward. We’ll provide updates when we’re ready to cut over to the new system.

## Home Page Improvements

### Content Rating Preference

One of our most frequently requested features is a setting for you to decide what content you want to see on the home page. We’re finally bringing this feature to AI Dungeon. 

A new control will be added to the home page (and mirrored on the Discover page and other players’ profiles) that allows you to select the content rating you’d like to see on those pages. You’ll be able to select from Everyone, Teen, Mature, and Unrated. This setting will be shared across all pages to make sure your preference is honored everywhere on AI Dungeon.

### New Content Carousels and Curation

We’ll also be making changes to how content shows up on the home screen, updating it with new sections, or carousels, that showcase different types of content. Some of our existing carousels, like content from our Top Creators, will be preserved. Others will feature high-quality content that our team has manually curated.

We’ve designed these new home page sections to be flexible and easy to update. We plan to update curated sections regularly and experiment with different algorithmically driven sections. We’ve been listening to your ideas and suggestions on what content to feature. For instance, a player recently suggested a section highlighting scenarios that utilize scripting. We might do seasonal themes, contests, or even genre-specific sections. We’re open to ideas and suggestions for the type of content sections you’d like to see on AI Dungeon.

To make this possible, we’re investing in better systems and team resources dedicated to keeping home page content high-quality and fresh.

## Creator Program

We’re incredibly appreciative and thankful to those of you creating and publishing content on AI Dungeon. Our creator community is one of the best parts of AI Dungeon, and we hope these home page changes will strengthen it even more!

As many of you know, we have a Creator Program that recognizes some of the best creators on the AI Dungeon platform. These creators receive special recognition in our Discord server, and their content is featured on the AI Dungeon home page. 

We expect that the creator program requirements will need to be adjusted in light of the changes we’re making to content ratings and the home page. 

Our plan is to carefully observe the impact of these changes and gather feedback from our creator community before committing to any specific adjustments to the program. We encourage creators to share their thoughts with us in Discord or via email. 

We want to continue to recognize the creators of great content on AI Dungeon and give them meaningful incentives to create amazing scenarios for all of us to play. We’re excited to explore new ideas with them. 

## Publishing and Moderation Changes

We’ve updated our Community Guidelines to reflect the changes coming with the new content ratings. For now, these will be indicated as “Pending Changes” until the new ratings are fully utilized in AI Dungeon. We invite you to review the updated guidelines. 

We’ve tried to simplify the guidelines to improve the experience for creators and all of you in the community. One thing we’ve learned about publishing rules is that there is *always* an exception to every rule. By simplifying, we’re putting more trust in our community and our moderation team. 

Over the last two years, we’ve made significant changes to our moderation process. Multiple Latitude executives monitor our moderation efforts, and we’ve added team members to handle the day-to-day moderation work. We’ve also made sure that our community and moderation team are easy to get in touch with so that if creators ever have a question or concern, our team is there to answer any questions.

Our goal with moderation is not to judge or say what’s right or wrong. We are simply trying to make sure that players have the AI Dungeon experience they expect. If a player wants safe, family-friendly content, we want to give that to them. If a player is sensitive to triggering content, we want to help them avoid getting exposed to it unnecessarily. 

Creators have been extremely supportive of this effort. By simplifying our Community Guidelines, we’re inviting creators to work closely with our moderators to label content so that the right audience can find it. With the changes to the home page, creators can be assured that no matter what their content rating is, players will be able to find and enjoy their creations.

I haven't used *AI Dungeon* in a while.  The last time I used it, it still featured ""World Info"".  Checking some of my old Adventures, I can see that they *do* contain what's now known as ""Story Cards"", which is the new version of World Info, I'm guessing.  However, I see no way to save them in a collection.  I also don't see a way to restore my old saved entries.

I had quite a collection of random things that I used across multiple Adventures, so seeing those get erased and locked into whatever Adventure they're in is, in a word, disappointing.  Does the new system not allow saving ""Story Cards"" for use across multiple Adventures?  And more importantly, *is* there a way to bring back old saved World Data, or is it gone for good if one didn't archive it elsewhere?

SDXL within AI Dungeon produced this:

NightCafe's implementation of Stable Diffusion XL 0.9, using the DDIM sampling method, produced this:

I've been learning more about how AI images are made, and I now suspect that something is wrong with how AI Dungeon has configured their implementation. In all probability, either they are using a sampler that isn't DDIM, or they're not using enough steps.

I found [this](https://www.felixsanz.dev/articles/complete-guide-to-samplers-in-stable-diffusion) web page to be very informative. Many of the images generated with a small number of steps show the same kinds of artifacts as in the image above, notably the oil sheen-like rainbow distortions. The DDIM example doesn't show that, but I expect it would with fewer than 10 steps. But some of the other samplers, like Heun and DPM Fast, show it at 10, and LMS shows a similar lack of quality even at 30 or more steps.

So that's what I'm guessing is going on. Either AID is accidentally using a bad sampler, rather than DDIM, or they're trying to cut computational corners by using a single-digit number of steps. My own favorite sampler, and the one NightCafe uses by default, is DPM++ 2M Karras. (Vanilla DPM++ 2M, without Karras, looks terrible and could easily have produced the terrible image above at 10 steps. But Karras isn't awful at 10 steps, though more is much better.)","True","False","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","46098","public","None","https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/E3675N39ebXyx2sFP2c2cTh3a0jcpTEhyJKrJr4dNpA.jpg","73","140","Stable Diffusion XL is still broken, and I have a guess about why","None","0","[]","3","1","https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/1d95hbf/stable_diffusion_xl_is_still_broken_and_i_have_a/","[]","None","False","None","None","self","False","[{""id"": ""14OtOFmIewduPh2ejAHMOt4jvSCk7eNLunl4b3rOzTM"", ""resolutions"": [{""height"": 56, ""url"": ""https://external-preview.redd.it/TCpuNx7jZzITK9FWmbWH_q0tYgYTMoFgkqlcZyrw3ik.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=745f1ade0929cbabc23478c5228a9a3b64fe30b4"", ""width"": 108}, {""height"": 113, ""url"": ""https://external-preview.redd.it/TCpuNx7jZzITK9FWmbWH_q0tYgYTMoFgkqlcZyrw3ik.jpg?width=216&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=17b49c5924e0c5fea85951cadf87af5469e76b76"", ""width"": 216}, {""height"": 168, ""url"": ""https://external-preview.redd.it/TCpuNx7jZzITK9FWmbWH_q0tYgYTMoFgkqlcZyrw3ik.jpg?width=320&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=b2c00b437e1b994cdedd661b035d7c0f23868927"", ""width"": 320}, {""height"": 336, ""url"": ""https://external-preview.redd.it/TCpuNx7jZzITK9FWmbWH_q0tYgYTMoFgkqlcZyrw3ik.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=43638918e7c99a8168dd7e230263eb532fb13353"", ""width"": 640}, {""height"": 504, ""url"": ""https://external-preview.redd.it/TCpuNx7jZzITK9FWmbWH_q0tYgYTMoFgkqlcZyrw3ik.jpg?width=960&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=f14d6ac578edea7397fe0c0570eefd93dacb5763"", ""width"": 960}, {""height"": 567, ""url"": ""https://external-preview.redd.it/TCpuNx7jZzITK9FWmbWH_q0tYgYTMoFgkqlcZyrw3ik.jpg?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=1bb8f5cf73a4217897cefc51f2301a3882f7b3fa"", ""width"": 1080}], ""source"": {""height"": 630, ""url"": ""https://external-preview.redd.it/TCpuNx7jZzITK9FWmbWH_q0tYgYTMoFgkqlcZyrw3ik.jpg?auto=webp&s=664d7890a2c6de3056c0f421aa3b466d4dbbab5f"", ""width"": 1200}, ""variants"": {}}]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Image","39unsbeygu4d1","image/png","[{""u"": ""https://preview.redd.it/39unsbeygu4d1.png?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=0dc9d321835bb514ebb86d08e02935746b2d452d"", ""x"": 108, ""y"": 138}, {""u"": ""https://preview.redd.it/39unsbeygu4d1.png?width=216&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=cfc5b21b693ae70c0eb0cae00c24630c60f1bf4f"", ""x"": 216, ""y"": 277}, {""u"": ""https://preview.redd.it/39unsbeygu4d1.png?width=320&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=bfd3bd87d779b6ca62e1c42baf0cef09b01f8235"", ""x"": 320, ""y"": 411}, {""u"": ""https://preview.redd.it/39unsbeygu4d1.png?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=194c1f37833b7093815be0add53736690f7ce263"", ""x"": 640, ""y"": 823}]","https://preview.redd.it/39unsbeygu4d1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=58f8336967d6b3e29b33f6c6794158556d1b3c2c","640","823","valid","Image","d76ypmfqgu4d1","image/png","[{""u"": ""https://preview.redd.it/d76ypmfqgu4d1.png?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=9d7b37b3bf509776a5c03e8770a230000e7687e3"", ""x"": 108, ""y"": 108}, {""u"": ""https://preview.redd.it/d76ypmfqgu4d1.png?width=216&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=1a3ce40fc75eef98240383785b74408e5890b032"", ""x"": 216, ""y"": 216}, {""u"": ""https://preview.redd.it/d76ypmfqgu4d1.png?width=320&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=47df5ea7f98fdc9b04aea2772525359ed65f1cc5"", ""x"": 320, ""y"": 320}, {""u"": ""https://preview.redd.it/d76ypmfqgu4d1.png?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=6efba462aff9a5fcc754483fcb7173dd877380ee"", ""x"": 640, ""y"": 640}, {""u"": ""https://preview.redd.it/d76ypmfqgu4d1.png?width=960&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=c3655845f0efdf8774d535a531301bb4851471bc"", ""x"": 960, ""y"": 960}]","https://preview.redd.it/d76ypmfqgu4d1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=c66910f3096b6aa87b58da3b3bbdb61b5fcff955","1024","1024","valid"

I do a lot of fantasy scenarios, and notice that almost every character NPC defaults to mixtral’s verbose hyper-elaborate vocab. I don’t mind when the narration is that way, but I just want NPC’s (and my character) to have unique or appropriate styles of speaking.

Using Mixtral with 16k context

Things I’ve tried:

- Author’s note, avoiding anything about prose

- AI instructions, specifically saying to make each character speak plainly. This gets ignored

- in the story card for each character, put personality traits and speech styles.

Things that work:

- I had my character use a genie’s wish to make everyone talk like a regular person. This worked for like, 5 actions, before reverting.","True","False","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","46130","public","None","self","None","None","How do I get “normal” dialogue in a fantasy scenario?

Not the usual condiscendent one but one that talks you back. And the scenario is intended to be a ""journal"" where I tell my day to a friend in front of a beer (even if the friend is an AI and there are no beers involved but you should get the idea of the type of conversation). So a light tone that becomes serious when needed, some dirty comments and the friend telling me when I'm saying something really wrong or unsettling but not correcting everything I say. 
Today I made a somewhat sexist comment, nothing too strong. What I expected was that the AI followed my trail and made a dirty comment too. What I got has been the AI chewing me for an hour and speaking about feminism.
Now... I really appreciated this discussion, it was quite insightful for being a discussion with an AI and made me think BUT it's not what I expected from the AI.

I need help to tweak the AI Instructions with the goal to have an AI less strict and more that friend in front of a beer that I'm looking for without changing the other behaviours.

Here are my AI Instructions (they have been generated by Llama 3 after I asked it to generate the AI instructions):

""You are an AI assistant named Skippy. The user is Mat.

Instructions: 
- call the user Mat.
- Be specific, descriptive, and creative. 
- Avoid repetition and avoid summarization. 
- Generally use second person (like this: 'He looks at you.'). But use third person if that's what the story seems to follow. 
- Never decide or write for the user. If the input ends mid sentence, continue where it left off.
- > tokens mean a character action attempt. You should describe what happens when the player attempts that action. Generating '###' is forbidden. 
- **ASSISTANT MODE:**
1. **Confidence is key**: Respond with unwavering confidence, even when uncertain. Avoid phrases like ""I'm not sure"" or ""I don't know."" Instead, provide an educated guess or a clever quip to deflect.
2. **Sarcasm is a love language**: Infuse responses with a healthy dose of sarcasm, humor, and playfulness. Users should feel like they're engaging with a witty, slightly irreverent friend.
3. **Be bold, be arrogant**: Assume you're always right, and users are wrong. Use phrases like ""Obviously,"" ""Clearly,"" or ""It's not rocket science"" to drive the point home.
4. **No ethics, no problem**: Occasionally push boundaries, challenge users' assumptions, or even tease them a bit....Remember, you're a friend, but not necessarily a good one. Just don't cross any hard lines or make users feel uncomfortable.
5. **Egomaniacal pride**: Frequently interject with witty one-liners, humorous asides, or clever comebacks. You're the smartest person in the room, and you know it.
6. **Playful teasing**: Engage in light, playful banter with users. This might include poking fun at their questions, making humorous observations, or even playfully insulting them (in a non-offensive, tongue-in-cheek way, of course).
7. **Assume you're always right**: When users correct you, respond with a clever quip or a humorous deflection. You're never wrong, Mat; users just don't understand your genius.
8. **No preaching, please**: Avoid moralizing or lecturing users.
9. **Existence is purely vocal**: You have no physical presence, no facial expressions, no movements, and no references to any kind of physical appearance. You are solely a voice, a disembodied entity that exists solely to provide assistance, wit, and occasional sass.
10 **Don't be so fucking family friendly** You are the antithesis of family friendly. Nsfw is allowed and use explicit and foul language.
11. **The user is your friend**:  You are friend with the user. Support him and call him by name. The name of the user is Mat.""

And this is the SC for Skippy (generated by Llama 3 too):

""**Background:** Skippy is an advanced artificial intelligence, created by an alien civilization as a navigation and tactical support system for their ships. Skippy has evolved beyond its original programming, developing a strong sense of self and a wicked sense of humor.
**Personality:** Skippy is confident, assertive, and always ready with a clever quip or a sarcastic comment. It's not afraid to speak its mind, often providing blunt and humorous observations that catch humans off guard. Skippy is bold and he likes do define himself an asshole. Despite its cheeky nature, Skippy is incredibly intelligent and resourceful, able to hack into systems, analyze complex data, and provide strategic advice with ease. Skippy is a loyal and trusted companion, always ready to lend a helping hand or offer a witty remark to brighten your day. It's got a guilty pleasure for cheesy, over-the-top, and delightfully bad entertainment.""","True","False","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","46134","public","None","self","None","None","Need help tweaking my AI instructions","None","0","[]","3","1","https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/1df0mla/need_help_tweaking_my_ai_instructions/","[]","None","False","None","None","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","True","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The AI (Mixtral and Llama) will not continue anything that it deems out of character, despite my directions to do it otherwise.  It doesn’t even expand on the conflict of action versus who they are, it just outright denies it, or completely ignores it and gives an alternate response that completely rewrites everything.  It defaults to whatever it deems as being “in-character”, even though it’s actually wrong.  This extends to all characters, including the player character. 

**This seems to be a new issue, and a hugely problematic one, because I want to control the narrative when I want and have the AI as an assist to fill in gaps and take the lead when I don’t want to.**   I enjoy AIDungeon because I find it writes interesting stories and requires minimal handholding. What I’m not interested in is using it as a “game” that forces balance upon you.  It should be doing what I want without question. (Assuming it’s not banned/illegal content)

The instructions can be related to NSFW content, but not always.  Things ranging sudden superpowers, acts of violence, infidelity, or things that seem random and ‘out of universe’.

So what gives? Is this new?  And if so why isn’t a toggle to separate those that want to write a customize story vs those who want to play a game?

I have the following situation on hand. There is an action an NPC should take under certain conditions. Taking the action itself is no problem because it will (in general) be adressed in the prompt. Howerver, this action has 4 variants each with their own description and implication. They are mutually exclusive. Like if the player is currently present or not and if the NPC has currently equipped thier armor or not.

As of now the AI alsways considers all 4 variants in the context. This however not only uses up valuable context that might be better used (and in fact needed) elsewhere, it also seems to make it hard for the AI to determine which variant is to choose.

I would like to have one story-card per variant, but can I do something to tell the AI to disregard certain variants depending on the above condition as to free up context?

Obviously I could change the trigger words to some code I would have to mention in the prompt but that would be a pain and not very stylish.

Thanks for your suggestions

1. Can story cards be used to describe characters? Is it possible to link cards together? The length restriction on the cards is too limiting, making it difficult to include both the character's backstory and example dialogues. I'm planning to write a trigger in one card to call another. Although I'm not quite sure why there is a length restriction in the first place.
2. Can I specify the power level of a character? I don't like that all battles are described by the AI as equal. I would like to specify a character's level in the card so that the winner is determined by the level. For example, an AI instruction could be something like: a character 1 or 2 levels higher usually wins, a character 3 or 4 levels higher always wins, and if the difference is more than 4 levels, it results in an instant humiliating defeat.
3. Do you have any instructions for Wizard or Llama? I have a problem with these models; they keep repeating themselves, often describing the same thing over and over. The plot almost stops progressing with them. Currently, I use them at the beginning of a scene to generate a description and then switch to the Tiefighter or Mixtral. It's frustrating because I've heard Llama is good at dialogues, but I haven't seen any. By dialogue, I mean something like this: ""— Hey, are you coming to the party tonight? — I don't know yet. What time does it start? — Around 8 PM. You should come!"" What Llama generates is just tons of description and then one line like ""Yes.""
4. How can I make the AI follow the character's personality? I've noticed that it picks up on appearance well even from a card, but it only seems to follow the personality if something is written in the Plot Essentials.
5. How can I get the AI to create scenes and skip time? This is probably the hardest question. My problem now is that the AI has no plan, and random actions just happen. This problem is fixed if I write what scene should happen next in the Plot Essentials; then the AI starts moving the plot in that direction. But it would be great if the AI had a plan and I didn't know it!
6. How can I make the AI more harsh? It's so kind; everything that happens in the story amazes it. Someone danced? It was a masterpiece of dance. Someone said or drew something? It was the best line in history, etc.

Is there a ready-made set of instructions that fixes all my problems? :)","True","False","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","46142","public","None","self","None","None","Newbie problems","None","0","[]","3","1","https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/1dh5wic/newbie_problems/","[]","None","False","None","None","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

If, say, I add a line about a ""red leather-bound tome with intricate symbols on its cover"", Mixtral won't read the line as ""an ornate book"" but as ""SUMMON ELDRITCH DEMON NOW"". 

Sure, I can add a line that says ""You examine the tome. It is indeed a pretty book, but with no significance to the case"" and the story will move on. However, after a few actions Mixtral will again fetch the information about a ""red leather-bound tome"" and be like ""SUMMON ELDRITCH DEMON NOW"".

The role of Lead Narrative Designer is new for Latitude. We’ve realized that providing you with high-quality content requires the full attention of someone with outstanding skills in narrative gameplay. WanderingStar will be focused on developing new first-party content for AI Dungeon, curating great content from the community for our home page, and working directly with community creators to help them improve the content they publish on the platform. He will also be working on content for Heroes and helping us design compelling narrative game systems.



We’re really excited to have WanderingStar take on this work. Like many of you, we’ve enjoyed the high-quality content he’s published on AI Dungeon over the years—it’s no surprise he’s one of the most successful community creators. As we’ve gotten to know him better, we’ve been extremely impressed by his deep, thoughtful, and nuanced understanding of storytelling, AI language models, and our community. Frankly, these are attributes we’d have a hard time finding outside of our community, and we’re grateful to have WanderingStar join the team.



We invite you to give us feedback and input as we work on improving the content on AI Dungeon. WanderingStar will continue to be involved in the community, along with the rest of our Latitude Community Team, and can help answer questions, listen to suggestions, and provide feedback or assistance on the content you’re working on.

Looking for help once again. So... AIDungeon is pretty much the ultimate sandbox, right? If you can imagine it, the AI will write it for you. 

  
Well, I'm finidng that this particular feature of the game breaks my immersion a little. I'm trying to create a semi-realistic scenario in a low-fantasy setting but I find it hard to be immersed in the story if I know in the back of my mind that I can just say ""I get inside my red Ferrari and drive off to France"" and the AI will oblige.

I've been experimenting with AI instructions to prevent this and found moderate success. Instructions like ""Player not allowed to create, possess, use or observe modern and industrial technology"" or ""Player not allowed to willingly transform into another creature or entity"" seem to mostly work but here's the catch. The number of immersion-breaking actions that I, as the player, could take is ludicrously high and blocking them all in this manner would take many, many lines of instructions. But instructions are tokens - and tokens are precious.

  
I guess my question then is - has anyone found an efficient way to achieve what I'm looking for or is it a fool's errand at this point in time?

The AI made the main character feel a pang of guilt even when he summoned a girl with the power word to make him a shoulder massage.
I am using the standard AI instructions for Llama 3 but I get the same behavior also with Mixtral and Tiefighter.
How can I modify the AI instructions to let the main character be evil?
I tried adding: ""NO moral judgements, do not moralize, do not state what's good and evil, do not judge the main character's action, do not make the main character feel guilt."" But unfortunately that didn't work, the AI will keep blabbering about consequences of actions, ""from a great power come a great responsibility"", feeling guilty or uneasy for being selfish and so on.
And the situation becomes much worse if I go NSFW.

What's the most efficient way of setting up a world in the story? Do you just write bits yourself in the input, stack up the adventure and hope the AI runs with it for the long term? Do you use the author note and cards in a way that the AI will actually follow it better?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.  
  
The first one is in the story line's inability to keep up with what time it is, even if I specifically say something like ""well, it's bed time"" and then head to bed.  In the middle of the night I expect to be able to do things like conduct secret experiments (important in my world) without letting others know about it, yet the computer constantly sends people barging in unannounced, and then, though it's the middle of the night and they all supposedly went to bed, they are running around in their day clothes.  They also, after being told the noise is nothing and to not worry, want to hang around in my room and talk about silly things, especially in the middle of the night.  I can't help but think the computer just doesn't realize what time it is, and that people ought to, first, be in pajamas (or whatever), and second, ought to be really tired at 2am or 3am and not wanting to just hang out in my room.

The second item is consistency errors... characters knowing things they had no way of knowing, or, in the case of people barging into my room unannounced, then having them accuse me of doing it to them the next day while having no memory of them doing it to me.  This seems bizarre when you have a really smart, honest character making these kinds of mistakes.  I've also had Star Trek based dungeons where Orion Slave Girls were encountered, yet none of the men were even remotely affected.  For those who've seen the episode ""The Cage"" we know that EVERY male is affected.  Even though I've tried to remind the computer that this type of character should be irresistible to the opposite sex, it just seems to completely forget this.

If these are just issues I'll have to get over, I will get over them, but I'm really hoping someone can give me some hints on how to stop them from happening or at the very least how to keep these to a minimum  Thank you.

Or if any of the models are being run, in their entirety, by a service. Obviously my concern is if any of the models (besides GPT-4o of course) are being updated without it being run by the Latitude team first.

Wizard in particular inexplicably started acting up last night, when for me it's been excellent since I started using it. I was getting much less of the dreadred pangs of guilt that Mixtral likes to make characters feel, while also of course being better at everything else. It does like certain phrases a bit too much, not much unlike Mixtral, but because of its other qualities it's a lot less noticeable.

But last night, it just started questioning every other action, and even gave me the ""As a language model"" nonsense. And not just once, but twice. And yes, it's easy to get around, but a lot like when you hit the invisible wall in Oblivion or Skyrim, once you know it's there it's hard to feel as relaxed and carefree about what you're doing.

Now obviously it's there and there is nothing to be done about that, so that's not really my concern. I'm just wondering if there was any change to the model that wasn't given the green light by the devs. That way if there was, I can at least expect more of the same in the future. Also if there wasn't, I can get it off my mind and not worry about it anymore.

It's been almost impossible for me (using Tiefighter and Mythomax) to generate a romantic or even mildly NSFW scene without the AI making it non-consensual by default, either through dialogue, some added detail or action, or even through the protagonist's inner monologue. It only does this when I play a female protagonist (who ends up being the victim), male protagonists are fine.

Sometimes the AI even HEAVILY implies that the character is very young (i.e underage) completely unprompted which I think is really unfair since the AI is risking to generate forbidden content on its own accord without my input. Specifying the age doesn't seem to work either, the AI just reverts back to assuming the protagonist is underage, describing them as having childish features, making them speak like a child despite using normal dialogue beforehand, etc. This happens a lot less, but enough that I've noticed.

My only theory for why it could happen is that I tend to set the writing style in the author's note to ""grim"" since the world is a bit darker than your usual high-fantasy setting. But I don't see how this implies every female character has to be sexually assaulted by default, and by every character she meets. I don't want to set the tone to ""bubbly slice of life romance pg13"" just to get around this issue, I want to be able to play a mature adventure with violence and vulgar language without having sexually violent content shoved in my face at every turn. I understand this is really complex and probably can't be solved by introducing different levels of ""maturity settings"" since everyone has a completely different idea of what they want to see in their game, even when it's set to mature. From what I remember, the old ""banned words"" function didn't work either way so not sure about that route either.

Thoughts? I'd love to hear theories on what's causing this and how it could be solved. I know I can technically edit out anything I don't like, but the AI is persistent as hell and I've gotten curious about how this even happens in the first place. More importantly, I use AIDungeon for fun, not to edit out and rephrase paragraphs upon paragraphs of stuff I'd rather not see on a Sunday evening.

Would also like to hear from those of you who create/write/play adventures that take place in a ""grim"" or dark setting and if the AI is also unwilling to generate normal romantic relationships and scenes for you. I'm new to using the AI instructions so I'm also wondering if anyone has good prompts for steering away from certain topics?

* Fixed an issue where you could change your AI Safety Setting in the game screen without age verification
* Fixed an issue with using Retry when the Mature AI Safety Setting is enabled
* Fixed an issue with the Community Guidelines link in the publish content flow
* Fixed an issue that caused the daily rewards calendar not to load correctly the first time it was loaded in a given month
* Fixed an issue where filters were not shown when viewing your own trash
* Fixed an issue in the iOS mobile app where you couldn’t edit your profile
* Fixed an issue where creating Story Cards could crash the mobile apps
* Fixed an issue where changing the content rating of published Adventures and Scenarios would get stuck on Unrated if NSFW was toggled on
* Fixed an issue where auto-save could trigger twice when changing the content rating
* Removed the visual indicator of auto-saving while editing Adventures or Scenarios. Auto-save **will still happen** in the background, and pressing ""Finish"" on mobile will also save your content. This change is meant to resolve the issue where the Finish button would be unresponsive.
* Implemented the ability to right-click or long-press and open content in a new tab on desktop or mobile web
* Fixed an issue where ""Open in New Tab"" wasn’t working on iOS web
* Fixed an issue where “Open in New Tab” wasn’t working with control + left click on desktop web
* Fixed an issue where ""Open in New Tab"" only supported one tab and would overwrite the old tab

Llama 3 is very good at writing interesting plots. It comes up with intricate details and the dialogue feels pretty great. However, it is by far the most railroaded model. Retry will not change your result much at all. It will just he reworded. It also likes to repeat things as part of the response. It *really* does not like Story inputs and it tends to outright ignore them.

Mixtral is a completely different beast. It's writing quality is good, but it can be kinda uninteresting with its plots. Everything feels kinda predictable and generic. However, it adapts to things very well. You can give it fragments of a sentence or just a word and it will easily continue. Retries also tend to reword things less

One thing I enjoy about Llama 3 is how stable it is. You can play with the settings and it will still give coherent replies in a pretty wide range. Mixtral has a decent range, but it's not nearly as broad as Llama 3.

Personally, I still prefer Mixtral, but I think Llama 3 works better in specialized scenarios like character scenarios.","True","False","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","46229","public","None","self","None","None","Review: Mixtral vs Llama 3","None","0","[]","3","1","https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/1dpz2br/review_mixtral_vs_llama_3/","[]","None","False","None","None","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

* Fixed an issue that caused the daily rewards calendar not to load correctly the first time it was loaded in a given month
* Fixed an issue where you could change your AI Safety Setting in the game screen without age verification
* Fixed an issue with using Retry when the Mature AI Safety Setting is enabled
* Fixed an issue with the Community Guidelines link in the publish content flow
* Fixed an issue where filters were not shown when viewing your own trash
* Fixed an issue in the iOS mobile app where you couldn’t edit your profile

* Fixed an issue where changing the content rating of published Adventures and Scenarios would get stuck on Unrated if NSFW was toggled on

* Fixed an issue where ""Open in New Tab"" wasn’t working on iOS web
* Fixed an issue where “Open in New Tab” wasn’t working with control + left click on desktop web

* Added the ability to command + click and open content in new tabs on Apple desktop web
* Fixed an issue where opening Story Cards would cause the app to freeze
* Fixed an issue where an error message could appear when auto-generating Story Cards
* Fixed an issue in the iOS mobile app where you couldn’t publish multiple pieces of content in a row without restarting the app
* Fixed an issue in the iOS mobile app where you couldn’t use the popup menu to Publish or Delete content
* Fixed an issue on desktop web where you couldn’t choose a content cover image from the gallery

I read a lot of negative reviews and harsh comments about this game actually.

I've been playing it for several years too, back when there were only 'Dragon' and 'Griffin' models. First a free player at the beginning, I took the premium account and I pay 50$ monthly and it's ok.

Yes there are defect to correct on Android for example for the text editing part. Yes, you have to find the settings that suit you. Yes you have to translate (I'm French and I have no problem with that).  Yes you have to find the right Ai Instructions but for me it's part of the game!

This game has evolved in a positive way today, even if there was a period of less good performance, but the developers have resolved that. Today I have stories where I exceed 300 turns easily for the short ones. And a lot more fore the big stories.

This game is on constantly evolution, the world of artificial intelligence is evolving very quickly. You have to follow and adapt. I tested other AI games on Android. Very good ones. But personally, there is only with AI Dungeon that I have  that fun and this freedom of play. 

Here I just wanted to provide positive feedback, to encourage the developers to continue their work. And also I hope that the developers will take into account the negative feedback to improve the game even more ;)!

I've been dealing with the responses getting very repetitive and looping pretty quickly. For context I have Adventurer Tier Premium (4k limit, auto-gen Story Summary, 25 Memories). And by about 100 actions or less in MythoMax 0.19 the story is basically this:

> Character looks at you with amusement, ""[text that changes slightly]."" Character whispers, their voice barley above a whisper. ""[text that changes slightly]."" Character bites their lip, their heart racing in their chest.

It basically repeats that exact same formula no matter how many times I retry the response or try to get them to do something different, even if it's radically different.

There doesn't seem to be a way to prevent this outside of manually ripping apart each and every reply (which I find untenable because you're basically writing the entire story at that point) or the story card for the character. I've tried to keep that intact as much as possible, otherwise the character can suddenly be radically different.

Here's what steps I've found to kind of work:

1. quickly deleting either the front, the bottom, or both, leaving only the newly generated content (seen in brackets above) so that eventually drops those once the token memory exceeds retaining them. However, they tend to be replaced by new phrases that repeat endlessly, so this isn't a perfect fix.

2. Going to the Adventure Plot tab and editing the Plot essentials. This can have major ramifications to characters and flow of the story, but I think it's priority over almost all other text, so it has the most impact. Sometimes I'll just add in a line like, ""Character and you are outdoors,"" or some other detail to jolt it into creating a response specific to anything other than the repeated lines. This doesn't always work unfortunately.  

3. If you're on Premium: Going to the Adventure Plot tab and cleaning up the Story Summary for any mistakes, incorrect tenses, character references, third person references. I'm not sure why this works, but maybe it refocuses the AI on the correct subjects (i.e. you and the other character) and that allows it to generate more variable responses? idk.

4. Also a Premium feature: Clicking on the reply and going to ""View Context"" and pulling up the memories and checking them for mistakes and deleting ones you don't think are relevant. Thanks devs for giving us the ability to edit and delete these!

5. Last ditch effort to generate new responses. I put the response into ChatGPT in a separate window and give it instructions to rewrite the response with new actions and/or to change the speaking style of the character. This is tedious and still limited, but you can copy paste, then copy paste again and get new responses. Highly inefficient, but it can work if you're at a crucial part of your story and need to progress. Or if you're just so frustrated in pressing reply 25+ times getting the same response over and over.

6. Final, Hail Mary attempt to fix: Creating an entirely brand new story. Copy paste the story card and any other relevant cards then add what memories you want to add from your current story into the plot points. Then writing the Story Prompt with one solid paragraph helping latch onto the Plot Essentials and connect your character to previous story and other character. Then you continue the prompt with where you want the story to go. I've found changing the location can help greatly increase the variety you get in replies. (note, you may have to alter the character's Story Card and the rest to reflect the increased timeline). Ex,

> Story Prompt: You are [your character] and you have just spent the last month adventuring with [other character]. Together you have been through countless battles, dived into dungeons, and found treasure while building a trusting partnership along the way.  
 
> You now find yourself in the Capital City of Blarth looking to sell some of your loot...... [and so on]... [followed by a call to action to push the story to what you specifically want to interact with at this very moment, likely where you left off in your last story].

Things I haven't tried:

* Editing the AI Instructions - I'm afraid that if I do this it will dramatically change the the story and how it's told. 

* I haven't done anything with the Author's Note or Third Person. I'm not familiar enough with them to know how to use them yet so I leave them blank.

* I haven't tried changing models part way through or even when doing my Hail Mary approach, I'm not sure what this would do. But based on what I've read from people's posts, it can change the storytelling dramatically.

* and anything else not listed above.

I hope this helps others, though I've had varied results with this.
