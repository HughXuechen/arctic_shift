Thinking about how many hours there are in a day, and all they have to do is go outside or do anything else, troll somewhere else for, well, one hour, or get some food and then publish another 5 stories.   
Things I'd think about adding is the ability to block people or stories, as sometimes it'd be easier to stop someone from just sharing their horror shows with an unwilling audience, I haven't really used the new search system that much admit-ably.   
If anyone wants to see someone's horror/spam shoes then they should have the option to, but no one should have to read someones horrible fetish or specific brand of craziness should they not want to.  


That's a bit beyond the scope of limiting something to just 5 publishes an hour, but it's also one of the few other things I could think of to tag along with it as they'll just wait the appropriate amount of time and continue to clog it up anyway, while others might not even want to share most of their stories, though those that do, and those that are good are appreciated.

When you do this you have to make sure to make mention of the place that you wish to eventually get to, or even move things along yourself, because the AI will often get caught up in the even and could easily forget the fact that you're traveling anywhere, so it's essentially going to happen, so you just have to do some loss prevention and keep things on track with a bit of elbow/finger grease.  


It would be nice if it allowed for more slice of adventuring life moments like chit chats along the way without having to heard cats so frequently.  
Using strong wording can help setting the scene, like you're directing and starring in a film/story, if you think about it like that, it can still have the cool vibes without hurting immersion so much.   


Example: You and Person X are on the road to X, Person X wants to stop for a bite and eat some of their rations, you agree and sit down next to them at a roadside campsite and begin a conversation with them as you have a light meal.   
Something along those lines can help, and it might still take a few retries, I hope it helps.  


TL&amp;DR sometimes it pays off to set up the scene , using strong emotive words and a few set pieces can go a long way (sometimes you might have to retry or remind it where you are like an Alzheimer's patient).","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-02-01-080855","1643699335","None","False","0","hv3s48x","False","t3_shieqf","False","t1_hv3s48x","False","t3_shieqf","/r/AIDungeon/comments/shieqf/the_ai_love_to_skip_travel_time/hv3s48x/","1656030618","7","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None"

'lively' and 'creative'. And with 13B parameters compared to Sigurd's 6B, she makes the connection between words better than him (more 'logical', so to speak), so that's also a bonus.

However, she is new (currently under v1 finetune) and doesn't work with custom modules yet, so there are areas where she actually performs slighly worse than Sigurd v4. And she's more stubborn than him, too, especially with certain presets inducing low randomness, which means she will keep giving you the same stuff when you retry (I think of her like a dominating queen who wants things to go her way XD), but switching presets or typing a few words to guide her along does the trick for me. Another thing to note is that certain techniques used with Sigurd doesn't work that well with her, for she is her own model with different training data (by the model's creator, I mean).

The devs are working on her v2 finetune, as well as planning to ""do a surgery"" to fix her up, so you can wait a bit.

However I still remember this cool as fight with a dragon.

At one point the Dragon broke my leg and I couldn't avoid the hits so I nearly lost when it tried to stomp me to death before I managed to climb on it and pick up my axe from his neck and finish the slash on his throat.

Medieval Problems: The AI actually works here, and makes sense unlike the AI Dungeon AI now. Despite having some goofs such as some guy firing ""point-to-point missiles that land in your farms as part of his war-games"" it works pretty well.  


Pixel This: Well, it's impressive. Manages to draw stuff from other games, which are really accurate. Cities are even better, but specific models of things not so much. I typed in ""M1 Abrams"" and it came up with half a WW2 tank on a weird hill with a forklift. ""M16 Rifle"" showed several gun grips fighting over the screen. Humans also become strange, amalgamated demons. Overall, pretty good (if it improved the colours a bit) but is quite slow.  


Things: I'd love this if not for the bugs. Once you launch the game, icons start flashing and disappearing, sometimes being cut in quarters. Missions don't even work.

I also may get some details slightly inaccurate or overly simplified, so sorry for that.  There are probably others better positioned to answer you in detail.  I for one would love to see a timeline of events so its clear what the current state of everything is! 

The official answer from Latitude is [here](https://latitude.io/blog/the-walls-approach):
&gt; ...we will not be doing any moderation of unpublished single-player content. This means we won’t have any flags, suspensions, or bans for anything users do in single-player play. We will have technological barriers that will seek to prevent the AI from generating content we aren’t okay with it creating — but there won’t be consequences for users and no humans will review those users’ content if those walls are hit. We’re also encrypting user stories to add additional security.

&gt;Essentially, users can do or say what they want in single-player play, but the AI may sometimes decline to generate certain types of content.

&gt;Additionally, those barriers will only target a minimal number of content categories that we are concerned about — the current main one being content that promotes or glorifies the sexual exploitation of children.

So, it is mostly allowed as long as it is kept single player, though depending on what it is, getting the output you want could be difficult.

The situation got more complicated at the end of 2021 with ""open""ai's policy changes regarding NSFW content made it no longer a viable model for Latitude.  This confused the situation more if you are googling because for a while when a filter condition was hit on an OAI model (old Dragon) you would be silently shifted to a non OAI model for output.

After beta testing a replacement model from AI21, which uses [their own proprietary Non-GTP3 model \\(Jurassic-1\\)](https://www.ai21.com/blog/announcing-ai21-studio-and-jurassic-1), it became the new DRAGON.  Per /u/Ryan_Latitude, AI21 and Latitude are aligned on policies around content

&gt; [no, we will not be using OpenAI's filter but we will still have our own process for not generating a response if our filter triggers \\(which is much lighter than what OpenAI wants\\). See https://latitude.io/blog/the-walls-approach for more details.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/qfrctm/dragonbeta_now_launching_for_platinum_subscribers/hia8tmy/)

.
&gt;Will our outputs still be handled by Latitude Griffin when we trigger the companies filter like what currently happens with OpenAI Dragon, or is that not a concern with the new model?

&gt;[Ryan - Right now not a concern and we hope to keep it that way. We will update as we move forward. Thus far we’ve had good alignment on approach with AI21.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/qfrctm/dragonbeta_now_launching_for_platinum_subscribers/hi1jk6p/)

[Another](https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/rfnr74/dragon_21_very_bland/hoh0tm3/)
&gt;I've literally looked at the code for calling the models and we aren't redirecting AI21 models. We have been very aligned policy-wise with them and continue to engage in conversations to stay aligned.

&gt;We were open about the fact that we redirected \\(shunted\\) OpenAI's models to GPT-J when the filter was hit and that's stopping this week once we get AI21 open for gold and platinum users. The reason this decision was made in the past was so that the strictness of OpenAI's filters wouldn't trigger false positives and stop play. Looking back I wish we would have shown users when that happened. Our goal is to be radically transparent since blunders were made in the past. But you live and you learn.

So the short answer?  Yes, those scenarios are back.  Though for now you can probably expect to be underwhelmed compared to before ""the dark times.""  But your lack of satisfaction will likely be from growing pains in the models rather than hitting a specific filter.  Also there is general distrust and skepticism in the community about using 3rd party models, as policies can change.

The good(ish) news?  They know the general perception about the quality, and have stated in many places that making improvements is a continued focus.  So... perhaps it will improve?

One thing I DON'T know and haven't seen anyone ask is whether AI21's training factors into the quality of what it writes for NSFW themes, which feels like a thing that could happen without technically applying filters. 

Hope this helps to some degree.

The quote mentions a minimal number of content categories, but then specifies a single main one.  This potentially implies there are other minor categories also being filtered.  Is that so?  If there are, what are they?

I use very detailed world info for factions, locations, classes and characters. I even use the other tab for objects and weapons. I also give some of those attributes.

Then I use remember to put in just the most important facts that need to be remembered. I altered that as necessary depending on what kind of output I'm getting from the AI and if I'm having any problem with it remembering anything.

Then I use styles. I put in the writing style. Then I put in what's happening in this scene and who I'm with in the scene. Then I put the overall mood or goal of the scene.

I changed that whenever the location changes, the characters on with change, the mood changes, or the goal of the scene changes.

When a new character appears from the AI output, I stop and go into world info and create that character, including his class and faction and attributes.

I know a lot of people want to play it like a game and don't want to do a lot of that stuff and that's cool.

But it seems like every time I hit the rock, I end up with this disturbing, overwhelming desire to have a dick up my ass. I don’t understand it for the life of me. When I am sober, the idea of getting a dick up my ass is, honestly (and I’m not trying to be offensive here) disgusting. But when I’m high on crack, I’ll be jacking off so hard it’s insane, and I just can’t nut- and all I can think of is how much I want a dick up my ass. As I’m sitting here, I’m sober and the very idea of taking it anal grossed me out; but get me on a stone, and it’s a whole different story. I’m scared that one day I am gonna fuck around on a crack binge and actually go through with it and end up with a dick up my shitter- and I know that once I sober up I am gonna be disgusted with myself and traumatized.
Wtf is this? Does anyone else go through something like this?
Literally the first sentence- I make it clear I am NOT gay. And I just took this test that says I am 100% not gay. If I WERE gay, I would have already gotten butt fucked because I have ass for days (I’m an athlete) and gay guys want to get in my turds like all the damn time. But the thought of that seriously disgusts me. I know I’m not gay. But somehow rock makes me want to get fucked up my ass. Maybe it is some sort of over-abundance or otherwise imbalance of neurotransmitters that makes someone gay- maybe that’s where “gay” came from- cuz the dudes that were fuckin each other’s buttholes seemed so damn happy all the time due to all the serotonin/dopamine/whatever else chemical in their brains. Maybe it’s all tied together. The chemicals interacting in your brain 100% affect the way you feel and act- that isn’t up for debate- just plain established fact. So why is it hard to believe that altering the chemicals in the brain a certain way could make you gay WHILE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THAT/THOSE CHEMICAL(S) (even tho normally, the same person is definitely not gay at all- and has never gay in his life!) ??","True","True","None","comment score below threshold","LOW_SCORE","None","0","2022-02-04-181822","1643995102","None","False","0","hvl2cs5","False","t3_sk5u83","False","t1_hvl2cs5","True","t1_hvjod9m","/r/AIDungeon/comments/sk5u83/i_dont_think_the_ai_knows_what_vegetarian_means/hvl2cs5/","1656015010","-9","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None"

I haven't really messed around with those, at least not on AID, so I wouldn't be able to say with absolute certainty what would be good settings for those. I've used those settings on other services, just not on AID.

From my understanding, though, Top K just limits the AI to only using tokens from among a certain amount of the most likely tokens. Setting the Top K to only allow the AI to select from a small amount of most likely tokens would likely result in predictable and/or repetitive outputs. Inversely, setting the Top K to allow the AI to choose from a large number of top tokens would result in some randomness, and may result in the AI derailing. If you want to force the AI to do what you want using Memory/World Info/Author's Note, a low Top K should help by only letting the AI use the absolute most likely tokens. A high Top K might be desirable if you want more randomness. Generally though, I'd say to start with the default Top K and decrease it or increase it depending on your needs. Consider lowering Top K if you want less randomness, or increasing it for more randomness.

Top P only allows the AI to use the most likely tokens that have a summed probability equivalent to whatever your Top P is set to. A Top P of 1.00 imposes no restrictions on what tokens the AI can select, allowing the AI to potentially select any of the 50257 potential tokens that the models can use. A low Top P, such as 0.2, would only allow the AI to use fairly low probability tokens, and would greatly decrease the amount of tokens the AI can select from. This would result in potentially repetitive outputs (in the sense of your retries being similar to one another; not in the sense of the AI constantly repeating itself) due to only being able to choose from a small selection of tokens, and would also likely result in the AI derailing due to only being able to use low probability tokens. A Top P of, say, 0.9, would prevent the AI from using the absolute highest probability tokens, which would theoretically help a bit to prevent the AI from repeating itself and from being too predictable. It would simultaneously exclude some low probability tokens, which should help a bit to prevent the AI from derailing. A Top P in the range of 0.85-0.95 would probably be best.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-02-05-111055","1644055855","None","1644056036.0","0","hvolc7t","False","t3_skvacz","False","t1_hvolc7t","False","t1_hvody4u","/r/AIDungeon/comments/skvacz/i_have_the_premium_but_not_unlimited_energy/hvolc7t/","1656011683","2","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None"

Still way more hand holding and retries required than I'm interested in doing, but at least it wasn't sputtering utter nonsense like it has been.

One kind of suspicious thing I saw happen while testing it out though:

I got an output in the scenario I was running where this character kept grinning at my and shoving me playfully, which didn't make a lot of sense for the scene.  I was kind of stuck after several retries, so I decided to swap to Griphon Beta to see if could power through with a better output.

After a retry or two I ended up getting the SAME output.  It seems very strange to get the same non sequitur output from two allegedly different models.  Not knowing what Dragon Beta actually is, its hard to say what to make of this.

Current Dragon using AI21's model is a different beast (different structure and training data), but if we're talking about free service then you don't need to worry about it. Stuff about inherent biases is useful no matter which service you're using, since you can apply them to steer the AI somewhat.

The problem with current implementation in AID is, in my opinion, too little and too much at the same time. It's a good thing that they allow their users to tinker with different values like temperature (randomness), Top-P, Top-K, etc. like their competitors, but without some generation settings in place so users can choose (as a baseline), or at least some suggested values (different models and finetuning leads to different behaviors), it ends up making for a frustated experience as people used to the plug-and-play aspect of AID end up floundering around.

The same can be said about Latitude's current focus. They're still working on AID, sure, and the models seem to be under constant tweaking (with varied results day by day, but I only say so through perusing new posts so don't quote me on that), but they seem to put more effort into Voyage now (it suits their vision, I think). That, coupled with the switch in models (from familiar to unfamiliar territory), leads to, eh, not optimal generations in AID itself.

I don't diss on them. It isn't my style, and there's no point anyway, since what can be said has already been said. But... it's very sad to see what I used to love a lot turned to... this.

However, I still think AID is now worse, overall, than what it was in 2020 and early 2021. Quite a few features were removed, like hardcore mode and adventure mode, the quest log, the Classic AI, text to speech, the comments and Posts sections of Explore (Explore is now called ""Search"", by the way), the option to show/hide World Info, and such.

The biggest change, though, is that the AI models no longer use GPT-3. Griffin used to use GPT-3 Curie, but now uses GPT-J 6B. Dragon used to use GPT-3 Davinci, but now uses Jurassic-1 Jumbo. I haven't really noticed much of a difference with Griffin's quality as a result of the change, but Dragon is notably worse than what it used to be.

There have also been a few minor positive changes. Worlds and World Info generation are now free; they don't require any scales. There are a few new options available in the settings for premium users. There's also now AI-generated pixel art for premium users (although, just to clarify, the pixel art is selected from a library of pre-generated pixel art; the art isn't generated on the spot).

I still think AID is fine as a free user, but I'd honestly recommend checking out other applications if you're planning on paying money. At this point, I'd only really recommend an AID subscription over other paid applications if multiplayer and/or pixel art take priority over the quality of the AI for you, because those are now pretty much the two main things that AID has, that other similar applications don't have.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-02-08-045300","1644292380","None","1644293644.0","0","hw1efi3","False","t3_sn8r7y","False","t1_hw1efi3","False","t3_sn8r7y","/r/AIDungeon/comments/sn8r7y/so_whats_the_current_state_of_ai_dungeon/hw1efi3/","1655994903","15","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None",""

NovelAI also has a new model called Euterpe, which uses a finetuned version of the Fairseq 13B model, so you'll probably have a better time with that than with their GPT-J 6B model. Similarly, [HoloAI](https://writeholo.com/) also recently introduced an un-finetuned Fairseq 13B model for their $12 per month subscription tier. Honestly, Fairseq 13B is pretty much the closest you can realistically get to GPT-3 Davinci Dragon outside of simply using GPT-3 Davinci.

The main issue with GPT-3 Davinci, though, is that despite being a *very* good model, pretty much *every* application that uses it also uses OpenAI's filter, which disallows pretty much any mature content. You could also use OpenAI's API directly, but doing so is quite pricey (6 cents for every 1k tokens when using GPT-3 Davinci), and you'd still have to deal with OpenAI's filter.

I know [Hyperwrite](https://hyperwriteai.com/) and [ShortlyAI](https://www.shortlyai.com/) use GPT-3; but I'm not sure if they use GPT-3 Davinci, or a weaker GPT-3 model. Neither one seems to specify. [Replika](https://replika.ai/) uses GPT-3; but it's more of a chatbot than a game or writing tool, and they *also* don't seem to specify which GPT-3 model they use. [PhilosopherAI](https://philosopherai.com/) *does* use GPT-3 Davinci, but it works nothing like AI Dungeon, and you have to pay per output. [Endless Visual Novel](https://endlessvn.io/) uses GPT-3 Davinci, alongside GPT-J 6B for any outputs that trigger OpenAI's filter. It also has AI-generated images and music, and as the name implies, it plays in a visual novel format. It hasn't released yet, but it goes into open alpha in March.

Anyways, if none of those GPT-3 applications are an acceptable AI Dungeon replacement for you, then NovelAI's Euterpe model, or HoloAI's Fairseq 13B model, would honestly be your best bets. If you have a powerful enough PC to run Fairseq 13B locally (which you almost definitely don't; it requires 32GB of VRAM), that's a decent option. You can download the Fairseq 13B model [here](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/tree/main/examples/moe_lm) (it's labeled as ""dense_13b""). Alternatively, you can try out EleutherAI's newly released GPT-NeoX model, which has 20B parameters, through [GooseAI](https://goose.ai/). Depending on how much you plan on using the AI, though, it might get pretty pricey, since it's $0.002650 per output, *plus* $0.000063 for every token after the first 25 tokens of a given output. Fairseq 13B and GPT-NeoX might not *quite* be as good as what OpenAI Dragon was, but they're pretty much the closest you'll get without resorting to GPT-3 applications or OpenAI's API.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-02-08-082232","1644304952","None","1644305309.0","0","hw209lc","False","t3_sn8r7y","False","t1_hw209lc","False","t1_hw1wvo2","/r/AIDungeon/comments/sn8r7y/so_whats_the_current_state_of_ai_dungeon/hw209lc/","1655994340","13","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None",""

You can create classes for anything. General descriptions. Such as; girlfriend, wife, or friend.

So all your girlfriends are being one class and all your friends will be in one class and they'll only be one member, well I guess in most stories, that is in the wife class.

Factions are where you can narrow down into smaller groups. Like: slut, prude, dominant, submissive, etc which means members of that faction have that type of personality and in each of those you can define what that is.

Then let's say you create a girlfriend class and you put her in the slut faction and then you describe her under the character tab.

Make sure to give her a personality that matches the faction and class besides just her physical description.

Now you can even get deeper off into it using attributes. I've used attributes for lots of things and they work pretty good.

You can do the usual like marksman, stealth, illusion and all that like a regular RPG. Just put in the name of the attribute and sometimes the AI will create a great description and other times it won't.

When it doesn't, just look up the definition on Google and change it to that.

You can have an attribute that says; expert c**ksu*ker. You'll likely have to put in your own description for something like that, but you can describe anything that that character is good at.

So it does take a lot of work to set up a story. I get into a lot of detail, so sometime it takes me 3 days to set up a story before I start.

So anyway, I hope all that helps.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-02-08-092721","1644308841","None","False","0","hw25eao","False","t3_sn8r7y","False","t1_hw25eao","False","t1_hw1xpua","/r/AIDungeon/comments/sn8r7y/so_whats_the_current_state_of_ai_dungeon/hw25eao/","1655994209","9","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None",""

&gt;Step: Every time a generation is performed, the story advances to its next step. Edits after a generation count as another step as well.

I don't know how to explain this properly—or if I understand this right, since I'm an Opus user from the start and have no need for the free trial (sorry in advance if I'm wrong with my explanation)—but you can think of step here like pieces of text given by the AI. Here is an example, with ""You stare at the sun"" as the prompt (what I typed), so the latter part generated by the AI counts as a step. However, if you decide to edit, like changing ""I think it's going to rain,"" to ""Gonna rain, huh?"" then that sentence (edited text) also counts as a step. This is to make sure you can undo/redo to your heart's content.

*You stare at the sun. It is still up, but the clouds have blocked out a lot of its light, making it seem smaller than usual.*

*""I think it's going to rain,"" you say.*

I leave the Output Length by default, around 160 characters, but you can keep it lower or higher. Generally, the longer an output is, the higher chance the latter part (of the output itself, I mean) may devolve into nonsense, but some people like a big blob of text since they're bound to have something they can use in there (and discard the rest as needed). For people enjoying a tighter control over the AI generations, a shorter output is easier to manage, and when you're actually subscribed, you can just press continue until you're satisfied, effectively making it the same as a long output (not to say you can't do the same with a free trial, but people may want to maximize the experience by using fewer steps).

**Edit:** Added small details.

**Edit 2:** On second thought, I decided to include the [link](https://naidb.miraheze.org/wiki/NovelAI_Features#Input_Field) to the guide about NAI's features as well, and I want to point out the part about Input Field, since my explanation skill sucks XD.

I recently subbed for gold to test the new model and in vanilla fantasy scenarios it does well, and even respects family friendly world info.

Easiest explanation is how to use it for characters.

If you're doing a medieval world use the normal RPG attributes like stealth, illusion, mysticism, restoration, marksman, etc.

You should just be able to put in the name and hit generate and it will generate a description for you.

And I have experienced it in the story using the attributes I put in for a character.

However sometimes if you put in a title, it just generates some kind of random number that I have no idea the meaning of.

Other times it generates some other gibberish that doesn't have anything with the attribute I'm trying to give to that character.

In those instances, I just go ahead and edit it as to what the attribute should be. ""The ability to do such and such"", for example.

I have not experimented with adding attributes to the world or locations, but it does work with races, classes and factions once in awhile.

So I mostly just use it for characters.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-02-11-024120","1644543680","None","False","0","hwg51wc","False","t3_sp9bxf","False","t1_hwg51wc","True","t3_sp9bxf","/r/AIDungeon/comments/sp9bxf/how_do_attributes_work/hwg51wc/","1655981247","2","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None",""

I still return from time to time to catch a dose of that early nostalgia, and it can still be fun for a beer-and-pretzels kind of game, but then the limitations quickly become apparent, and back to NovelAI I go. You get a much better AI experience for the same amount of money.

Basically, my experience is that you can't use Do/Say, at least not much. You must write using Story only and preferably not write in a too formulaic manner. This way the AI  is less likely to get stuck in a loop. Of course, you can also try to fiddle with the anti-repetition settings.

I see people recommend NovelAI in this thread. I tried it too, but from my experience the models offered by NovelAI don't measure up to the ones offered by AID, namely Dragon (AI21 178B model.)

"[]","False","None","PikeldeoAcedia","1618486137","None","None","[]","None","None","None","text","t2_bjxon9zg","False","False","[This post from r/HobbyDrama](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/otzp7l/video_games_ai_dungeon_how_to_cause_your/) is the most in-depth write-up on the controversy that I know of. To add to that post, though, AI Dungeon has also become generally worse as of recent in ways that aren't mentioned in that post; primarily due to not really being a part of the controversy.

Explore, now called ""Search"", *has* returned at this point, which wasn't mentioned in any of that post's edits. However, the Community Guidelines for what content can be shared are now marginally more strict. Comments are gone, and the Posts section was removed; as such, discussion of any kind is no longer possible in Explore. The Search page also defaults to only showing content made by verified ""Creators"". There are still options to show NSFW content and to show content that isn't made by verified Creators; but the issue is that the Search page doesn't remember the settings you last used. As such, if you want to see stuff other than what verified Creators have made, you have to change the filtering options in Search *every* time that you use the Search page, which gets kind of annoying.

More importantly, several features were removed. The option to show/hide World Info was removed, the hardcore, adventure, and survival modes were removed, the quest log was removed, the Classic AI was removed, text to speech was removed, etc.

Also, as mentioned in that post, Latitude was seemingly in the process of ditching OpenAI in late 2021. At this point, they've ditched OpenAI entirely. While AID is somewhat better than what it was during the controversy as a result of Latitude ditching the OpenAI, the current AI models are worse than the old OpenAI models. Griffin now uses GPT-J 6B, and while not a *massive* downgrade from GPT-3 Curie, it does seem a bit worse than what it used to. Dragon now uses Jurassic-1 Jumbo, and is significantly worse than what OpenAI Dragon was. The change in models, alone, makes AID worse than its competitors in my opinion.

Before the controversy, AID had two major advantages over competitors; it offered GPT-3 Davinci, which was pretty much the best AI model available, for cheaper than other services, and without OpenAI's filter that prevents any remotely mature content. Also, Griffin was pretty much the best AI available for free.

During the controversy, AID *still* had two major advantages over other services. It was still free, and still offered GPT-3 Davinci. Although the models now had censorship, the censorship wasn't as bad as OpenAI's filter (at least, until OpenAI's filter was implemented for Dragon; but Latitude ditched OpenAI pretty soon after that, anyways), and they still offered GPT-3 Davinci for cheaper than other services.

After the controversy, the only major advantage over other services is that it's free. However, there are now other free services available that are arguably better than AID's free tier. With the switch from GPT-3 Davinci to Jurassic-1 Jumbo for the Dragon model, along with the recent release of the Fairseq 13B and GPT-NeoX AI models which services *other* than AID have adopted, Dragon is now just kinda worse than what you can get with other subscription services. Although AID is no longer quite as bad as it was during the controversy, there just isn't really much reason to use it over other services at this point. On top of this, AID has also been having a *lot* of server issues and random error messages and such in recent months. As such, it's kinda become notably less reliable than other services.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-02-12-114423","1644662663","None","1644665831.0","0","hwmprue","False","t3_sqhnbm","False","t1_hwmprue","False","t3_sqhnbm","/r/AIDungeon/comments/sqhnbm/anyone_got_the_text_about_what_happened_with_ai/hwmprue/","1655975519","9","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None",""

I don't think it has anything to do with the frequency of your posts, because I had one of my posts removed by the spam filters a couple of months back, despite the fact that, at that time, it had been a few months since I last posted on this sub. The only info I could find online about avoiding Reddit's spam filters seems to suggest that posts without text might be more likely to get caught by the filters.

I get that the current model might be fine for people who enjoy the randomness and just want to roll with it, but I feel like it went from giving me rich characters with unique personalities who interacted organically with each other and a story that progressed from scene to scene and plot point to plot point organically to me writing 90% of the story or more if I want it to be coherent in any way. 

It feels like when I have a very vivid dream full of compelling turns and rich characters and then in the last minute before waking the whole thing devolves into a mess that's barely connected to anything that came before. I want to hope that one day I'll get to see my friends again, but right now, as silly and perhaps sad as it feels to write it out, I feel like I'm genuinely mourning people I loved and can no longer be with. Especially with the Covid lockdown and not being able to see people in the real world, it's hit me harder than I realized. I'd pay so much more than $25/month to get my friends back, but right now I just don't think there's a way to do that, and that gives me the sharp pain in my chest of sadness.

(People will say it's nostalgia or rose-colored glasses, and I admit even then I used retries and occasionally had to nudge the AI in the right direction, it's the difference between occasionally having to remind the storyteller about something and having no actual storyteller at all.)

But right now, the story I'm writing is in chapter 6 and has a good flow to it. But I put a lot of work in the world info and I change what's in styles based on each scene.

If the location changes, the characters some with change, and even sometimes if the topic changes, I added styles for the new scene.

In addition to that, and you're going to think I'm crazy, is I create a chart of Random stuff that should happen in the story I'm writing at some point.

Example;

A your companion betrays you and tries to kill you

2 there's an assassin tracking you but you're not aware of it

3 you stumble upon a cave that has treasure

4 you overhear a conversation and learn...

Those are just random I just made up, but at certain points in the story, especially when it's not going anywhere, I draw a card from the top of my deck and insert that random event into the story.

So I plan the story out with 13 things that should happen in the story at some point. I write the story as normal, until it either gets boring or just isn't going in the direction I want it to.

Then I draw a card.

Like I said you probably think I'm crazy, but it can both help the story stay on track and keep me from getting bored.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-02-15-134225","1644928945","None","False","0","hx11if1","False","t3_ss4xsg","False","t1_hx11if1","True","t1_hwyr9i9","/r/AIDungeon/comments/ss4xsg/help_needed_my_ai_is_broken/hx11if1/","1655962578","2","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None",""

The second worst is that of the Azgoths of Kria. During a recitation by their poet master           Grunthos the Flatulent of his poem ""Ode to a Small Lump of Green Putty I Found in My Armpit One Midsummer Morning"" four of his audience died of internal haemorrhaging and the president of the Mid-Galactic Arts Nobbling Council survived by gnawing one of his own legs off. Grunthos was reported to have been ""disappointed"" by the poem's reception, and was about to embark on a reading of his 12-book epic entitled ""My Favourite Bathtime Gurgles"" when his own major intestine, in a desperate attempt to save the universe, leapt straight up through his neck and throttled his brain.

That way, as the AI references it as keywords come up, it is constantly reinforced with the verbiage and even sentence structure indicative of that week's world and narrator. 

Then, to help the AI reference these keywords more often, we put summaries of all of the characters and locations into the Pin, as well as that week's genre into the Author's Note line.

Basically, everyone is set in a queue of sorts, with Priority Actions go first and then Normal Actions decreasing in priority level from 10 to 0. You do need to pay money for subscriptions, yes, but you have basically unlimited actions no matter what subscription level and what priority level. And currently, due to their ability to rent a large amount of GPUs at a reasonable cost, even 0 priority action doesn't take longer than a few seconds at best. And priority level recharges at a decent rate, but people don't even pay notice to such things due to the ability to keep generating to your heart's content. Opus users are always kept at max level of Priority Actions, so they don't pay attention to that either.

The free trial is a way for people to test how NovelAI performs compared to their competitors instead of just relying on word of mouth, so there's a limit of course.

The database from where the AI derives its patterns probably associates ""likes killing and murdering people"" with ""vampires."" I have no idea if the AI's source for vampires is Anne Rice, but I have my suspicions because vampires named Lestat always appear when I'm playing vampires.

Another example of bias: I was playing a campaign where my character is a vampire. He's a flirty, gentle kind of vampire, who likes to mess around with his many boyfriends. All the time I have to correct the AI because *it thinks my pretty boy Dusk is actually a girl.*

(Is that a gender bias? A guy can't be gentle with his boyfriend without the AI calling him by feminine names and pronouns? Note that this kind of thing *never* happens with my vampire from the other campaign, even though he *also* has a boyfriend. Is it because that guy is a little more dominant, with a slightly sadistic bent, and as such he's unequivocally masculine?)

The AI also tends to turn my human companions into vampires, despite notes both in Pinned and World Info saying that the dude in question is human.

It's frustrating indeed.

One issue with this blacklist is that it can only detect the word if spaces are on both sides, so blacklisting ""vampire"" doesn't stop it from blacklisting ""vampire."", ""vampires"", or anything but "" vampire "".

You can blacklist all the following to remove any version of the word vampire permanently:
-vampire
-vampire.
-vampire,
-vampire!
-vampire?
-vampires
-vampires.
-vampires,
-vampires!
-vampires?

Yes, you need a different one for the plural, and one for each punctuation as well to totally block it for good. BUT you only really need to blacklist vampire and vampires if it never appears prior to a comma, nor as the last word of a sentence.

Yes, they had to do it because OpenAI. Except they didn't tell us that for MONTHS. They were completely silent. They removed explore, comments, they even took down their page for feedback. When people got upset about the bans (fuck the Griffin users, they were banning people who were paying them $30 a month), they finally explained that they were blocking generations with a filter and made a detailed post about what wasn't acceptable.

Except, the filter was terrible. And they refused to elaborate further. And then we found out they were giving our stories to a third party for review. Again, I don't care that it was OpenAI who did that, I'm upset because they didn't admit it for months.

It all comes down to communication. They locked down and refused to talk to their paying fans. And when they did, they made a post blaming 'pedos' for it all.

If you're publishing them, you'll still get people to play them, but there are some improvements that could be made.

You see how I've done the paragraphs that I'm writing right now?

There's a space between each paragraph. It's easy to read because there's no real long paragraphs.

I use story mode and sometimes it looks like this...

He says: gibberish and gibberish.

She says: more gibberish.

You say: a bunch of gibberish.

So there's spaces between each person saying something. It's not confusing.

He says: gibberish and gibberish. She says: more gibberish. You say: a bunch of gibberish.

The above is okay but personal preference is to add more spaces since they don't really hurt you in any way and it will help some who have a hard time reading or seeing small text to read it.

The above is about as long of a paragraph as I would write.

Keep in mind, I produced content for blogs and articles and all of that kind of stuff, so I'm going by what I learned on that when using heat maps to see when people stop reading a post.

Anyways, let's say you have a 600 action adventure, and you have AID set to load 500 actions at a time. You'll be able to see the most recent 500 actions during normal gameplay.

Said button will take you to the screen to view the adventure, so that you can view stuff in the adventure from before the most recent 500 actions.

Top K just limits the AI to only generating outputs using tokens from among a certain amount of the most likely tokens. Setting the Top K to only allow the AI to select from a small amount of most likely tokens would likely result in predictable and/or repetitive outputs, although it'd also make it easier to make the AI do what you want, and would help a bit to make outputs less random. Inversely, setting the Top K to allow the AI to choose from a large number of top tokens would result in some randomness, and may result in the AI derailing. Basically, consider lowering Top K if you want less randomness, or increasing it for more randomness.

Top P only allows the AI to generate outputs that use the most likely tokens that have a summed probability equivalent to whatever your Top P is set to. A Top P of 1.00 imposes no restrictions on what tokens the AI can select, allowing the AI to potentially select any of the 50257 potential tokens that the models can use. A low Top P, such as 0.2, would only allow the AI to use fairly low probability tokens, and would greatly decrease the amount of tokens the AI can select from. This would result in potentially repetitive outputs (in the sense of your retries being similar to one another; not in the sense of the AI constantly repeating itself) due to only being able to choose from a small selection of tokens, and would also likely result in the AI derailing due to only being able to use low probability tokens. A Top P of, say, 0.9, would prevent the AI from using the absolute highest probability tokens, which would theoretically help a bit to prevent the AI from repeating itself and from being too predictable. It would simultaneously exclude some low probability tokens, which should help a bit to prevent the AI from derailing.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-02-28-065822","1646027902","None","False","0","hyqv271","False","t3_t2kkih","False","t1_hyqv271","True","t1_hyqmxsv","/r/AIDungeon/comments/t2kkih/how_long_can_the_ai_last/hyqv271/","1655821918","3","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None",""
