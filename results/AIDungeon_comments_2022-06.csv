&amp;#x200B;

1. **New Payment Option.** We're regularly asked for a single payment option. That really hasn't worked well for AI in the past. We've been able to get the cost of Griffin down enough that we feel confident in the pricing model of offering a single payment for access to Griffin without ads.
2. **New Channel.** Steam is a massive platform with 120M \\_active\\_ players. While we have decent player acquisition through current channels Steam will open up another large market for players to discover and enjoy AI Dungeon. Steam is where more than half of all PC games are downloaded (I've read that up to 85% of PC games are purchased through Steam).
3. **Another Distribution Option.** As we continue to migrate AI Dungeon into Voyage and launch Voyage Studio, an eventual part of the strategy to enable players to build their own AI experiences will be distribution. Like other game creation platforms, top creators will be able to monetize their creations. Offering avenues to easily distribute successful games on platforms like the iOS App Store, Google Play, and Steam may be a way we help top creators reap the rewards of their work.   


It's going to be a different kind of game than most offered on Steam. There are lots of things to improve about AI Dungeon, many of which we are currently working on.

1. Most of our negative reviews come from android. We do have some performance issues there, it’s a more international audience so we get a lot of 1-star reviews asking for additional language support (which isn’t well supported by language models), and many people hate the past changes from truly free play to monetizing. None of those should be as big of issues on Steam. 

2. We have a core group of haters for the past issues with OpenAI and the clunky handling from our side. Steam shows the hours of play with reviews and tends to prioritize engaged players. If someone wants to purchase the game and put hours into playing just to give a negative review, ok then. Steam reviews are harder to game than some platforms. 

3. We have found responding to reviews and fixing bugs / support issues has been helpful on the android store. We’ve gone from a 1.9 star rating ( after the attacks from 4chan ) to a 3.4 by engaging. Still not great, but much better. 

4. Negative interactions with the model are a big source of negative reviews. We’re working on some UX improvements to how models are selected and how settings adjust that will help players not shoot them selves in the foot. Also working on finetune improvements that will help some of the issues. And finally want to make some small changes to help new players know what to expect from AI models, which can always be a little crazy. I’m planning on some of those changes landing before the launch. 

Even with all this we will still likely get some negative reviews, maybe a lot. Our past is definitely controversial. This is a test with a new platform. At very least we will learn a lot. And if it goes well this could add another good source of premium players as we continue to grow.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-06-02-034041","1654134041","None","False","0","iav0kz0","False","t3_v2ostv","False","t1_iav0kz0","False","t1_iautj1e","/r/AIDungeon/comments/v2ostv/ais_coming_to_steam/iav0kz0/","1655317416","3","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None"

What are some of the ways you've made it so that said clunky handling doesn't happen again?  There were a few issues that stuck out in my mind - the lack of end-to-end encryption, the security issues, and the lack of transparency concerning major changes were the big things.

That said, over a million players a month experience AI Dungeon and a solid subscription base continues to show support. 

We've invested a little work into porting our web experience into an electron app for distribution on Steam. We field many requests for a single payment option vs a subscription. We're now able to offer that for our Griffin model.

As for outages I'm always interested in reducing those. You can see uptime reports at [https://status.latitude.io/](https://status.latitude.io/) which is where we log when outages occur, usually due to server issues from growth or when our model providers struggle (we are the largest customer of every model provider we've used). Some of the outages from this past week were from investments in hardening parts of our tech stack to avoid outages in the future. 

Android app performance isn't where I'd like it to be. That continues to be a work in progress.

Griffin is definitely a less powerful model than Wyvern, Dragon, or Hydra mode on Wyvern or Dragon, but we can't offer any of those as a 1-time payment (yet). Maybe in the future.

One focus right now is helping players know how to get quality outputs from the models. Comments on Griffin are varied and output can definitely be wild at times. Using author's notes and memory, using reasonable settings, retrying to find the right output, and editing when needed are all things that can help stories be more consistent.

Author's notes is very influential in your story, but I've found it's best for tone vs facts. Others may have different mileage.

In the future there may be better ways to keep track of ""facts"" in a more database-style way to make sure certain things are true. We have some prototypes on Voyage Studio experiences that are using different approaches to specifically not allow contradictions.

The reality is that often with so much spread in terms of devices, OS versions, and other factors, it can be difficult to replicate issues, which in turn makes them difficult to fix. It's one reason that I'm excited about AI Dungeon being rebuilt as a part of Voyage over time so that it's a more stable experience (with a much better editing experience).

The recent login issue for select Android players is an example. We've used the physical devices and OS versions that have been reported and still haven't been able to replicate it, even with a few dozen reports. It's still on our list and when we get new info we're testing to find a better fix than inviting players to use their mobile browser.

There's your essay. :)

Not sure why they didn't specify that on the Steam page for AID, that seems like something that should be mentioned there. I guess that *does* make the Steam version a bit more appealing than it'd otherwise be, although I'm also not entirely sure AI Dungeon 2D is worth paying for, for reasons I've explained elsewhere in a different comment. To quote, well, myself: ""AI Dungeon 2D just selects an image from a library of curated, pre-generated images made with [Pixray Text2Pixel](http://pixray.gob.io/text2pixel/), based on what image it decides to best fit the story. It's alright, but I'm not entirely sure it's worth paying money for given that it just displays pre-generated images that were created with a free AI application. It using curated images can also result in you seeing the same images multiple times, or ending up in a situation in your story that there simply isn't a fitting image for (this is *especially* true for NSFW content, as Latitude specifically wanted to not allow the feature to display NSFW images).""

Of course, your opinion may differ. I just don't personally see curated pre-generated images of dubious quality as being worth paying for. Although, I've seen now that the Steam version will apparently also have ""full settings control"" (I assume that means the premium settings like temperature, length, and such, will be available?) and no ads (on a side note, why are they replacing energy with ads? I feel like ads will be far more disruptive than energy ever was, unless they're just banner ads or something).

Yet again, I have no clue why that isn't specified on the Steam page, that stuff seems important to clarify for the sake of people (myself included, in this case) not immediately dismissing the Steam version because they think that unlimited Griffin is the only thing it has going for it.

Definitely not wise for us to release the larger models as a single-pay option. The smaller ones are in a place cost-wise where this makes sense for a variety of reasons at a certain price point. 

We do care about the value and are working on model improvements like fine-tune adjustments, custom fine-tune options, and more visibility in what's being sent the received from the models.

**Encryption.** You can't have end-to-end encryption with this tech because you have to put text into a model at some point. We currently encrypt stories in our database.

**Privacy.** We don't moderate any unpublished stories or read stories without permission from players. OpenAI was the pushing force behind moderating player stories, moving forward with an over-aggressive filter, and generally not treating player data well. There's a reason we've dropped them for our production text models. 

**Transparency.** I've explained in a few places but the team at the time didn't feel like they could be transparent because of pressure from OpenAI, which at the time was the sole provider of these types of models. That meant no public talking about filtering, who was pressuring what, or data issues that came up, with threat of legal action. I had to work for a couple of months after I joined and get our own lawyers more involved to get the statements we did about data.

I'm happy to answer any other questions. A big part of my job after I joined as head of product mid-way through 2021 was helping to climb out from under the weight of how things had gone with OpenAI. Before I joined I asked a lot of questions that are similar to those the community asks at times. With context, a lot of what seemed crazy from the outside made sense. 

Plenty of things that didn't go well and maybe the existing team could have handled differently. But I get it. And we've glad we've been able to make some big adjustments to get things going again with community interaction.

&gt;You are Kaiyo Suzuki, a female human tuner living in Sunset Hills, a neighborhood in Santa Rosa City. You're 23 years old and have been a tuner since you were 18. You met a man by the name of Jason and he's been your teacher and mentor ever since. He owns one of the largest tuning shops in the city and you work there along with several other tuners.
Because of your quick wit, skill, and good looks, many men have taken an interest in you. But you're more interested in racing than brooding over romantic interests.
You love street racing, but have always held back from joining a Midnight Club race because you heard some street racers were shady.

You feel dangerous and bold, and scream down the sharp curves of the coastal road, your training ground which somehow feels fresh as you parlay your nerves into a renewed sense of concentration that you haven't felt since you felt your first game of No Reds.

'Jesus fuck, Kaiyo! Calm down!' yells Jason, gripping the armrest, halfway between laughing and yelling. ' I didn't teach you to do that! You're going totally nuts!'
'I can't help it!' you shout. 'It's like everything is in slow motion!' Sure enough, with every hairpin turn you manage to thread the needle, you caress the curves, and you feel as though you're one with your car, gasoline in your veins, and the pistons your hammering heart.

It's then that you realize not only are you now ready join the Midnight Club, it's your birthright. Jason now laughing loudly, reaches out slowly, and his fingertips briefly brush the back of your hand gripping the stick shift. Just as briefly as he makes contact, he pulls away as though burning his hand on a hot carburetor. You don't notice though. Right now, you've got fuel for brains.

You pull into the place where the Midnight Club gathers, a large abandoned parking lot on the edge of the city, lit up by the dozens of cars, trucks, bikes and even tricked out long haulers, the kind you seen photos of from Japan. Stepping out of the car, hip hop blares from no apparent source, drowning out the dull roar of revving engines as the drivers, riders, pushers, salesman and hobbyists engage in their ritual pissing contest. The smell of gasoline, exhaust, cigarettes and pot hangs heavy in the air, and a you look around, you see guns on the hips of various people. You know the Midnight Club doesn't fuck around, but even as bold as you feel, you think you might be a little out of your depth.

Jason climbs out of the passenger seat, takes one look at you and smacks you on the back. 'I recognize that expression! You're coming down from that high, aren't you?' 

'F-fuck' your stammer, leaning up against the door of the car, your knees beginning to shake slightly. Jason is a short, sharp sty, steps in front of you and looks you in the eyes. He puts his arms on your shoulders and says 'Look, I get it. I get exactly how you feel right now. I actually puked on the way to my first meet up. You're doing great. Just...hmm.'

'What?' you reply, an edge to your voice. Jason groans. 'You need a name. You never give out your actual name at one of these things. It's a liability, and it's also tradition. Let's think of something cool, memorable, something that reflects your personality...' he looks to the sky, trying his best to avoid eye contact with any of the racers. You can't help but glance around nervously, also dazzled by the cars around you, glittering, dangerous eye candy. It's a paradise for misfits addicted to adrenaline, like you.

Suddenly, from across the lot, a pair of shining eyes looked in your direction. You look directly into them, and without blinking, they grow closer and closer to you, seemingly brighter and brighter. A tall figure in a black jumpsuit is silhouetted by the blinding light around him but as he gets closer, his figure becomes more distinct. Tall, slender, but with a grace that you wouldn't expect from a member of the Midnight Club. Composed, smooth, every muscle moving with a certain purpose. He's gaunt and impossibly handsome. He has a sculpted chin that leads up to a fine, but powerful jawline. His cheeks are thin, slightly sunken, mostly flush to his jawline, and his thin, pale red lips are pursed. He has high, fine cheekbones and around, pale yellow eyes that seem to look straight through you. And on top of his head, his hair is fixed into an impossibly clean, glistening, well-rounded, jet black pompadour with a streak of bone white running through the right side. 

'Hm' he says non-committally. As you look at him, the sound of the roaring engines seems to fade away, entirely dominated by his presence. 'Jason,' he says in a rich baritone, his voice amiable and measured. 'Taken on a student, I see.' Jason, completely lost in thought and unaware of the man's presence, suddenly jumps at the sound of his voice. 'It's you! Oh, oh fuck!' exclaims Jason. The man smiles. 'Yeah, ""oh, oh, fuck,"" it's me""', the man replies with a smirk.

'Kaiyo, stay away from this guy, he's a fucking-' 'You, Jason,' the man emphasizing his name firmly, 'have no place to speak on my behalf!' He reaches into his back pocket and grabbing a comb to fix a flyway strand of hair on his coiffed quiff. Jason takes a step back and sighs. 'Really now...' The man sighs. 'So, who is this?' The man looks to you and raises an eyebrow. 'She looks...like she could be trouble.'

You laugh nervously but try to banter, not wanting to appear weak. 'Haha, uh, y-you're one to t-talk!` your stammer, a bead of sweat rolling down your forehead. The man tilt his head back and narrowed his eyes at you  Jason's face goes pale and he covers your mouth. 'Goddamnit, don't mouth off to him! You don't even know-' A second later, the man tosses his head back and starts to laugh loudly. He actually doubles over, and Jason joins him. The dramatic change from attention to unabashedly laughter stuns you, and you freeze in place.

Moments later the laughter ends, and the man turns to Jason. 'Laughing because I started to laugh. You always were a sheep,' he scolds. Jason scowls. 'Why I...' The man turns to you, his countenance once again friendly. 'You. I like you.' You gulp, trying to compose yourself. 'It takes guts to insult me, especially when you barely know me. Not even my friends insult me. It's basically suicide.' You blink. Suddenly, instead of fear, the sensation of boldness and power you had before start to well up inside you. The high that you've experienced only when knowing that you've escaped the jaws of death.

The man grins a toothy grin, an uncanny grin that seems to be slightly too wide for his face. 'Oh...you liked that, didn't you? I can smell your adrenaline. If you haven't decided on a name yet, how about...' he puts his hand to his chin, tapping it and looking askance. He snaps his fingers and points to you. 'Yeah! How do you like...Suicide Girl?' Your heart beats fast and without even thinking, you shout 'Hell yeah!' You look back at Jason, who gives a reluctant nod. 'Yeah. Yeah, that name's pretty cool.'

The man grins even wider and as he does, his eyes narrow slightly. 'Alright then, Suicide Girl. Welcome to the club. They call me...' 

'COUNT GREY!'

As to that actual post, if you manage to get down to the end BUT ONLY AT THE END is it mentioned, you'll see that it was OpenAI that was the party who put in and mandated the filter, not AIDG.

&gt; The early filter was also so rudimentary, people were apparently encountering it in situations as simple as knights getting on a horse, kind of a staple of fantasy games, or putting on a breastplate. The animal aspects of it were seemingly expediently removed, but the child related parts remained in place albeit with silent adjustments made.

I've also always doubted this. Even in the days of the filter I was unable to get it to trip accidentally. Back then I specifically made an adventure that was a cowboy selling watermelons door to door, both horses and watermelon being supposedly [""banned content.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/o76b8a/if_this_statement_is_true_then_any_time_now_the/) Never hit the filter even once.

So, frankly, don't put too much stock into a reddit thread, particularly one from Hobby Drama that has literally 0 rules for accuracy required. Nick has been very open about what really went down in the official discord where he posts under his own name. The discord screenshots in particular were from a really awful time when users were constantly spamming chat with hateful messages and blaming AIDG's problems on Nick's faith, with many users ONLY calling him ""The Mormon,"" something the 4chan /aidg/ folks continue to do.

&gt; As to that actual post, if you manage to get down to the end BUT ONLY AT THE END is it mentioned, you'll see that it was OpenAI that was the party who put in and mandated the filter, not AIDG.

I'm aware. That info is only at the end because that info came out *after* the post was originally made; it had to be included in an edit.

&gt;I've also always doubted this. Even in the days of the filter I was unable to get it to trip accidentally.

I can personally say that, at least for the first 1 or 2 days of the filter, that part of the post was actually pretty accurate. During the first 1 or 2 days, the simple mention of a child or a sexual term triggered the filter. It was pretty quickly changed to a 2-column Regex filter, with one column of sexual terms, and another of terms referring to, or relating to, children, where you had to use at least one word from both columns to trigger the filter. The animal censorship (presumably intended to censor bestiality) was also removed in about a week.

The filter still wasn't *great* after those changes, though. One of the biggest issues was that it was a Regex filter that only filtered specific terms, and that could also trigger because of words *containing* specific terms. So, using a word like ""breastplate"", ""analysis"", or ""cockpit"" would trigger the filter if one of the filtered terms for a child was also recently used, due to those words containing ""breast"", ""anal"", and ""cock"", respectively. Additionally, the fact that only specific terms were censored made it laughably easy to avoid the filter for people who were actually trying to generate pedophilic content, and who knew which terms were censored. Watermelons were never censored, though. The ""4 watermelons"" screenshot was taken back when numbers below 18, on their own, triggered the filter (it was later changed so that you needed to say ""years old"" or ""year old"" following a number below 18 for the filter to trigger). So, pretty much right when the filter was introduced. The term ""watermelon"" triggering the filter was a misconception.

The other things listed, as the blog post says, are things the hacker *also* obtained, alongside the aforementioned content from some users' adventures, scenarios, posts, and comments. That blog post doesn't contradict the hacker's claim that they had accessed users' private adventures.

In regards to the stuff that Nick said, I... don't see how that contradicts what the post says? The things Nick said were true; there *was* a lot of harassment towards, not only himself, but also towards other Latitude employees. I'm also aware that the /aidg/ (or /aids/, as they're now called) community did, and still does, call Nick the ""Mormon"".

Yeah. But people don't read. That specific post has been going around and it's full of literally incorrect information because the corrections are only in and at the end and not labeled as corrections. Did you ever wonder why the news puts corrections right at the top?

&gt; I can personally say that, at least for the first 1 or 2 days of the filter, that part of the post was actually pretty accurate. During the first 1 or 2 days, the simple mention of a child or a sexual term triggered the filter. It was pretty quickly changed to a 2-column Regex filter, with one column of sexual terms, and another of terms referring to, or relating to, children, where you had to use at least one word from both columns to trigger the filter. The animal censorship (presumably intended to censor bestiality) was also removed in about a week.

That may be the case and it's impossible to verify now that AIDG is no longer on OAI, but it was an OAI ""feature"" and not an AIDG one, and should be labeled as such in the post to be clear. It's like holding Ford responsible for tires that failed and Firestone had to recall; yes they used their tires but the problem wasn't Fords. It's the same issue here; OAI was their AI provider and the one who pushed the filter on them. This should have been clarified. 

&gt; The filter still wasn't great after those changes, though. One of the biggest issues was that it was a Regex filter that only filtered specific terms, and that could also trigger because of words containing specific terms. So, using a word like ""breastplate"", ""analysis"", or ""cockpit"" would trigger the filter if one of the filtered terms for a child was also recently used, due to those words containing ""breast"", ""anal"", and ""cock"", respectively.

Again, OAI's filter, not AIDG's. You see why this is important? Also, AIDG has always allowed explicit sexual content just not on OAI's dragon model where OAI refused to let it run. This also doesn't seem to be mentioned anywhere.

&gt; The other things listed, as the blog post says, are things the hacker also obtained, alongside the aforementioned content from some users' adventures, scenarios, posts, and comments.

But there's no hint of the scale. It certainly wasn't ""all"" users.

So what does the hobby drama post say?

&gt; A grey/white hat engineer published a report about a database vulnerability that had let them access *all* adventures. 

Italics were theirs. This is also factually not true.

Note that I typed that P.S. in haste and have since edited it to fix it. It was not all stories, just some vauge-ish number of potential stories, and defiantly did not give them access to ""*all*"" stories.

&gt; Unless I'm missing something, though, that doesn't disprove any part of the post.

I didn't really notice the ""*all* adventures"" claim. For what it's worth, though, you're correct on that. The hacker claimed that ""All non-deleted resources, created from Dec 16th, 2019 onwards, were affected by this vulnerability."" For context, AI Dungeon was released for browser on December 5th of 2019 and for mobile on December 17th of 2019. Assuming the hacker was truthful in saying that, then nearly all, but not *quite* all, adventures were able to be accessed; all adventures from the first 10 days of AID's browser release wouldn't have been affected by the vulnerability.

&gt;Also, AIDG has always allowed explicit sexual content just not on OAI's dragon model where OAI refused to let it run. This also doesn't seem to be mentioned anywhere.

I know. That paragraph was talking about the state of OpenAI's pedophilic content filter from roughly April 28th, up until Latitude made [this blog post](https://latitude.io/blog/filter-iteration) and changed the filtering method. At that time, though, Griffin, and Classic, before it got removed, were also using OpenAI models, not just Dragon.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-06-06-212019","1654543219","None","1654543899.0","0","ibeg20o","False","t3_v61pz9","False","t1_ibeg20o","False","t1_ibe64lx","/r/AIDungeon/comments/v61pz9/steam_ai_dungeon_dev_name_is_voyageai/ibeg20o/","1656939163","11","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None",""

Nope. 

&gt; The hacker claimed that ""All non-deleted resources, created from Dec 16th, 2019 onwards, were affected by this vulnerability.""

Yeah but they seem to be very wrong. We also don't even know what happened. It's possible it was an OAI issue, that recent submissions to the AI itself were just sitting there mostly unsorted on some disk drive waiting to be archived or parsed or whatever, explaining why it was only a small amount of stories that were accessed. This would, to me at least, explain the total lack of proper disclosure on what really happened given that OAI is an Elon Musk company and we should all know by now how his brands handle criticism of their own negligent practices.

This is kinda true, but kinda not. A lot of people like the Open Ai model. I didn't. The new dragon model is good but requires tuning to work well (I don't know why the anti-repeat settings aren't on by default). You get one week free with the subs, but I would try Griffin first.

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

Unfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.

- John cannot see.  (AI looks at this like ""John"" and ""see"" being very close together in the same sentence.)
- It is impossible for John to see.  (Same issue.)
- John is blind.  (AI sees ""John"" and ""blind.""  *Now* it will look at ""John"" and think ""blind."")

Similarly, ""Jake is weak"" or ""Jake is scrawny"" works better than ""Jake is not strong."" 

""Jane is deaf.""  ""Sarah is mute.""  ""Sally is wheelchair-bound.""  ""Joseph gets sick easily.""  

For the alien example, you could also try ""Humans are alone in the universe"" if you really want to avoid aliens, but you're probably better off just not mentioning anything unless the AI keeps repeatedly adding aliens.

If you're stuck with an inability that you can't think of a word for, try looking up a medical term online, like ""medical term for inability to XYZ"".  Then you can say ""Susie is infertile"" or ""Susie is sterile"" or ""Susie had her tubes tied"" or ""Susie had a hysterectomy.""  That may or may not work, depending on how thorough the AI's training is and how common of a term it is.  If it's a very niche term and there's no other way to phase it in your mind, you might have to ask others for phrasing ideas, keep editing undesired outcomes out, or just write the specifically desired parts of the outcome yourself.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-06-08-171253","1654701173","None","1654702090.0","0","ibm86lf","False","t3_v7jpnl","False","t1_ibm86lf","False","t1_ibl6xbj","/r/AIDungeon/comments/v7jpnl/ai_blatantly_contradicting_what_i_write/ibm86lf/","1656932424","12","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None",""

We at Dramcorp assure you that we are a responsible corporate citizen, and do not condone the type of misbehavior that has plagued the community recently. We also take great pride in the fact that we are the most well-capitalized media conglomerate in the world, and are therefore able to offer a wide variety of entertaining and informative programming, including this very newscast, and the in-depth investigative reports that you have come to expect from us.

We are not behind the recent rash of strange and unusual occurrences that have come to plague our fair community, and are not responsible for the events that have transpired. We are, however, a media company, and therefore do have a responsibility to inform the public, and we are doing our best to serve you, our loyal listeners.

I switch off the news broadcast, and look around, surveying the area, seeing if there's anything or anyone interesting around…

There are a few things to look out for, like the giant billboard on the side of the road advertising ‘The New Adventures of Captain Trips,' or ‘Live Paranormal Performances,' and the giant tent city that has sprung up in the parking lot of the local grocery store, where people are selling various ‘experiences' including ‘Scare-o-Rama' and ‘Spooky Séances'…

But other than that, it's just a typical ‘downtown' city area, with buildings and skyscrapers and streets and sidewalks and cars and pedestrians and all that stuff…

There are a few street performers, like the juggler and the acrobat and the fire eater, and some street musicians, like the man playing the saxophone and the woman playing the violin…

And there are a few cars passing by, and a few pedestrians, but not a lot…
It' s pretty mundane, actually.

I decide to check out the brand new Omega Mart grocery store, as it's their grand opening day, and I've heard that a good number of their staff are actually Demihumans, whatever those are…

Omega Mart is also having a grand opening giveaway for. The first 100 customers entering the store, the first 100 customers will recieve a free Demi-human lifeform plush stuffed animal, and the first 20 customers will also receive a free bag of Dramafruit candy!

Plus, all customers will be entered to win a free one year subscription to the Dramawitch newsletter!
I mean, who doesn't want that?

You mentioned that ""...legalization of adult porn led to decrease in illegal sex between adults as well"". But maybe the same attitudes that allow for the legalization and availability of porn also allow for the decriminalization of other forms of ""illegal sex"", like prostitution, for example. Therefore, is it really the influence of porn availability that causes rates to fall, or the relaxation of attitudes and laws that render ""illegal sex"" a crime to begin with, forget other confounding factors? If there are no more laws on what ""illegal sex"" is, there can be no statistics on the rates of ""illegal sex"" because there is no legal definition about it anymore. You can't gather stats on robbery rates, if robbery is without definition. 


Rather, the focus should not be on the state of things on the ground, because that can be influenced 1000 different ways. Matters like this should be judged on principle alone, not effect, especially when the potential for harm is there. Generally speaking, I never understood why people say that fictional cp yields no victims, when there doesn't need to be victims in the first place, to deem it wrong. Whether real children were used in the making of it or not, by producing, distributing, and consuming it, it still facilitates and propagates the questionable notion of sexualizing children altogether. 

The way I see it, the difference between a person who has homicidal thoughts and a person who does homicidal acts, for example, is the... act. But in either case, the principle of killing was there. And the difference between an attempted murderer and an actual murderer is.. a corpse. But in either case, the will to do harm arose. It's the thought that counts.

The Glare


You are reading with three other people in a dimly-lit cabin. Kate, her brother Charles, and their mother Lola. Kate is telling the story, with frequent interruptions from Lola.

You tell Lola to hush.
Lola hushes her children.
""I'm telling story, you hush as well.""
Lola is quiet.
""You hush as well,"" Lola says, almost threateningly.
Lola approaches you.

You back away.
Lola approaches you.
""You hush as well,"" Lola says, her voice becoming stern as she glances over her shoulder. You back away. Lola notices this, and glares at you.

You say ""Lola, what the hell has gotten into you.""
Lola glares at you, and says, ""You got me into this. And don't you dare tell me to hush. I'll hush this child anyday.""

You say ""So you're not gonna shut up and let your kid finish her story?""
Lola glares at you, and says, ""You know who started it, and you know who'll pay. If you have the gall to step up to me, I'll end it. You hear me?""

You grab Kate and Charles and make a run for it.
Lola takes off after you and your friends, and you all run through a maze of tunnels. Lola catches up with you and your friends. 

You say ""How much have you had to drink?""
Lola glares at you.
""You got me into this predicament, you can get me out of it! If I go back, she'll kill me! I know what her plan is!""

You tell Kate and Charles to run.
Kate and Charles run off. Lola lets out a hiss.
""I guess I'll have to do it myself.""
Lola raises a balled fist. You quickly step back so that she strikes you. Lola knocks you backwards and you roll along the ground. You stand up and Lola hits you again.

You kick Lola.
Lola flies out of the way as you plant a boot where she hit.
""Ow! Alright! Alright!"" Lola cries.
""Let go, Kate! Let go!""

You say ""Kate why are you here, I told you to run.""
Kate says ""I'm not running anywhere, this is your fault, you got us into this predicament!""
Lola says ""Well I'm not running either, and look where we are!""
Kate and Lola both run up to Lola's mother. Lola's mother backs away in fear. Lola screams at her mother.

You say ""What predicament are you even talking about?""
Lola glares at you.
""I told you to hush. If you had, none of this would've happened.""
Her mother starts to cry. Lola hits her.
""OW!""

You say ""But WHAT HAPPENED.""
Lola and Kate make a run for it. Lola manages to get Kate outside, with you running to catch up. Lola has a large cut on her forehead.

You bring Lola to the vet.
Lola's mother is very upset.
""Why would she do such a thing? Why can't anyone ever listen to me?"" She asks, as she leads you down the street.
""She lost her temper.""

You say ""I have no clue what's happening anymore.""
Lola's mother looks at you.
""I thought your parents were supposed to take care of you.""
Lola glares at you.
Lola's mother glares at Lola.
""Where are you going to hit you?""
Lola glares at her mother.
Lola punches herself.
""Aaahh!""
""They're coming! Come on!""
""Oh no! What shall we do?""
Lola takes off.
You run after Lola.

You stop running after Lola.
Lola stops running. You, Lola, and Kate stand at the end of the alleyway. Lola's mother walks up to Lola.
""Why did you hit yourself?""

You find Charles.
You walk through the tunnels.
You hear shouting from Lola. You run toward the sound of the shouting.
You see Lola standing in the middle of the room. Charles stands in the corner.
Lola yells at Charles.

You say ""Lola, stop abusing your kids.""
Lola glares at you.
Kate steps forward. Lola's mother backs away.
""Stay out of this, bitch! He's the one who started it all, not her!"" Lola says.

You say ""Woah Lola, watch your language.""
Lola glares at you.
""I don't want your help, thank you very much!""
You sigh and take off your bowler hat.

You say ""When did I get this hat?""
Lola glares at you.
""What, so you can't even have fun?""
Lola's mother walks up to Lola.
""Oh dear, oh dear, let me get you some cocoa.""

You say ""We're in an alleyway, where are you gonna get cocoa from.""
Lola glares at you.
Lola's mother walks away. Lola turns to you.
""What's fun about it, you bastard?""
Kate glares at Lola. Lola glares at Kate.

You pick up Charles and run away.
Lola lets out a yell.
""Kate, run!"" Lola says.
You hurry to carry Charles out of the alleyway. Lola throws a large rock at you.
""OW!""

You pick up Charles and run away again.
Lola's mother glares at Lola's sister. Lola glares at her mother.
""Leave him alone or he'll get you all killed!"" Lola cries.

You say ""nope.""
Lola's mother laughs. Lola glares at her mother.
""Fine!"" Lola's mother says.
Lola pick up a large rock. Lola's mother backs away.

You slap the rock out of her hand.
Lola glares at you.
""Don't you dare slap me!"" Lola says.
Lola slaps you.
""OW!""

You pick up Charles and run.
You carry Charles out of the alleyway. Lola follows you out. Lola's mother stands there. Lola's sister glares at Lola. Lola glares at her mother.

You run faster.
You run as fast as you can out of the tunnels. Charles lets out a yelp. Lola yelps.
""I'm not running this time you dirty whore!"" Lola says.

You run faster.
You continue to run. Charles lets out a squeal. Lola lets out a growl. Lola's mother glares at Lola. Lola glares at her mother.

You ditch Lola.
""Come on, let's get the hell out of here!"" you say. 
You ditch Lola. You run. Charles squeals. Lola growls.
""Don't you dare touch him, you Nazi!""

You say ""Jeez, you like namecalling, huh Lola?""
Lola's mother glares at you. Lola glares at you.
""I'll give you a piece of my mind!"" Lola's mother says.

You say ""You also like to glare.""
Lola glares at you. Lola's mother glares at Lola.
""Hey! You like namecalling, huh Lola?""

You say ""I just said that.""
Lola's mother glares at Lola. Lola glares at Lola's mother.
""Fine!"" Lola's mother says.

You grow wings and fly away.

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

IMO, yes, but only if you specifically want a text-based game. If you just want Ai stories, Novel Ai or one of the others is probably better. 

I haven't tried the free model, Griffin, lately. I only play on Dragon these days and it's been pretty good. Personally I find that the new Dragon model is a lot smarter than the old OpenAi version, especially with the repetition limiters. It can pick up on character traits and complex ideas more easily.

Then the backlash came, they apologized, and removed this ban and monitoring system (there's a Reddit post with the full story, but I don't have the link to it).

To extend further on this, the order to ban sexual content wasn't from Latitude themselves but in fact OA (OpenAI). OA wanted/wants to removed all sexual aspects from their AI and forced it upon Latitude, starting with the sexualising minors scenarios (tbh dunno why that was allowed in the first place but no point complaining now). Then OA just kept demanding more and more changes (which is why the censorship filter was so scuffed amongst other things), and Latitude just decided to stop using OA's AI.

I'm pretty sure what was OA's Dragon is now (or planning to be) used in customer service AI. And to explain why that, OA is trying to get Microsoft or some other big company to use their AI (not like those companies have their own AI models already).

Our perspective on whether the OpenAI Dragon was better than current models is a bit different. We actually had just as many complaints about OpenAI Dragon as we do the current models. As we look at our quality metrics, Train the AI data, review feedback from users, and go through testing and play it ourselves, it becomes apparent the models today are performing as well, if not better, than OpenAI Dragon.

So, why do so many people think ""old Dragon"" is better if our data shows it isn't? Honestly, we're not totally sure (and we're open to ideas). One theory I have is that when people play AI Dungeon for the first time—it's a magical experience. Seeing the AI creating interesting stories from a basic prompt is mind blowing. Our new users today have that same experience with our current models. What we see is that it's difficult to replicate that same level of magic over time. As people get deeper into AI stories, they start to see the shortcomings of language models in general, whether it was ""old Dragon"" (which is why people complained about it then) or the current models. They want it to feel as magical as that first moment, but as you keep playing, your expectations grow. There's potentially a sentiment bias that how the models worked on your first play might influence how you think of the models today.

One thing we want to do to help with that is provide tools and training to help players get more out of the AI. You'll see more from us on this in the next few weeks and months.

All that being said, one thing we've learned is each model has its strengths, and there are certainly scenarios that ""old Dragon"" did well in. Today, with our current models, we don't view one as ""better"" than the other. Griffin is faster, and can be more unexpected (which I like). Griffin can also have larger memory, which can reduce times the AI ""forgets"" details. Dragon and Wyvern can handle more complexity and might take fewer retries, but they are slower. 

If you are interested in more about model quality, [we put a blog post about this up a while ago that I think is fascinating](https://latitude.io/blog/ai-magic-part-2). In particular, I learned why model size isn't as critical as people often think it is.

The whole ""nostalgia effect"" for long-time players can be a part of it. And the current models have improved and do have their strengths, different from old Dragon. They are enjoyable and I'm sure will continue to be improved.

That being said, I think it's still old dragon was better. It's not a subjective opinion solely motivated by nostalgia, most people who played old Dragon will tell you it was better at describing, dialogue, and overall coherency, regardless of the scenario. Of course you'd still get complains, I remember those day and there were indeed a lot of them--but that's just inevitable, no matter how good the model is, there will always be some kind of complain, one way or another. And I understand why you, as part of the team, would want to downplay the quality difference between old Dragon and the current models; I am also absolutely not blaming you for leaving OpenAI behind, because it had to go. But it was still better. It wasn't perfect, it had issues, it wasn't good at everything. Obviously. But from a general viewpoint, old Dragon worked much better in terms of storytelling, coherence, literacy, it'd produce more elaborate outputs and would conform more easily to any writing style. I play since summer 2020, and even during the good old filter debacle, I still thoroughly enjoyed old Dragon, until the very day it was taken away at the beginning of the year, I wasn't disillusioned with nostalgia. I have some fun with the new models, and I want to stress that they have improved A LOT over a short period of time, but it's not at the level old Dragon was, regardless of what you're using them for. 

Of course new players will say that the current models are magical, since they didn't know anything else. But it's not a coincidence the question of improvement of quality is brought up again and again, even if I'm sure there is a lot of positive feedback. Ruling it as simply nostalgia is, to me, a bit disingenuous. Again, it may play a little part, for some people. But that's not the main cause of people saying old Dragon was better. It just *was* better.

Also, side note... tbh, and I've thought this for some time, and unless there's something I'm not understanding and in that case, my bad... but I don't think relying too much on the Train the AI to evaluate playerbase sentiment is the best. Don't get me wrong, it's a great tool, and as I understand it, it helped make a lot progress with the models... but to judge players' appreciation over models, it's a little off, imo. Like, 3 or 4 out of 5 times, it asks me to choose between outputs that are both either equally bad or bad for different reasons; if I choose one, that doesn't generally mean I'm approving of it, just that I had to choose one to continue playing. I'd wager it's the case for a lot of people; ultimately we HAVE to choose something, and to you on the receiving it seems it appears as if we're saying ""yup this is good"" when that's not necessarily the case.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-06-17-053552","1655436952","None","False","0","ico1a0i","False","t3_vdzay3","False","t1_ico1a0i","False","t1_icnnq37","/r/AIDungeon/comments/vdzay3/introducing_endless_ai_dungeon/ico1a0i/","1656899007","5","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

We're glad you still enjoy the new models, have seen the improvement we're making, but ***totally*** respect if you felt like old Dragon was better for you. The nostalgia idea is just my own personal theory trying to reconcile what our data shows, and what our long-time players felt about old Dragon. Really, some people DID have a better experience with old Dragon. And some people are clearly having great experiences with the new models. Both of those things can be true. 

You're absolutely right about the limitations of Train the AI. You'll be glad to hear it's not our only metric. The reality is that we have to consider a broad set of imperfect data to measure AI quality, because quality is somewhat subjective, and difficult to quantify. How do you measure coherence? Or story complexity? There is no single data point that can tell us this. We use train the AI, along with a myriad of other data points, as well as user feedback, personal testing, actual AI model testing data, and more to measure whether we're making improvements. But...you're right, none of those data points are perfect. Overall though, we are confident our models are trending in the right direction.

I'm not here to convince people that our new models are as good or better than old Dragon. That's up to players to decide. We want our models to be *so overwhelmingly good* that it's obvious that today's models (and future models) give the best experience on AI Dungeon. We're putting in the work to get there.

He stands in front of you in the hallway. Mousse, his mere existence, is an insult to you and your integrity. You are the Doctor, and since the first day of your life you have been, as you put it, his superior half.
While Mousse would treat his K-Class as though they were equals, you would abuse them until a suicide mission started to look like a mercy in their eyes.
While Mousse was making sure his Enforcers were well-fed and happy, you were holding them to the same brutal standards you hold yourself to.
(gets shot several times)
And you always came out on top. While his K-Class would hesitantly trudge into the battlefield, yours would do just about anything to escape your half of the field, even if it meant charging into gunfire.
While Mousse ran off to join the pathetic Crown Company, to scurry through the mud like a fucking rat just to slow down the progress of the human race,
(Mousse has left the room)
you embraced the cold certainty of the SRD. To him, the term ""ruthless efficiency"" comes with it a slew of flashbacks to the atrocities committed by his former nation, millions of innocent lives being snuffed out for mere ""weapons testing"", an entire continent deemed unimportant.
Of course, you were there for it all just as much as him. The same flashbacks, the same atrocities, but you don't hide from them. You enjoy them.

If the ads are as annoying as I think they are, I'll quit the AI dungeon and move to Holo, Novel, or even the free Dreamily. I'd rather pay them than sit on Griffin and watch the ads, waiting for the Latitude team to fix the Wyvern-Dragon, so I can pay them again. 

If you ask me, the energy replenishment system by watching ads was just fine.

P.s. I think my friend left too, since he got tired of paying for this state of the plat Wyvern and Dragon. And this is little sad, because I play on his account from time to time, checking both the AIs.

People complain every time Latitude looks to make some money and keep things going. Ads has been an idea ever since Energy was implemented. Yes, people asked for it and now they're whining because they got what they asked for lol.

Tried to play this morning, can't even progress beyond setting up a scenario.

This is after yesterday's black screen issue.

Maybe someday someone can make this whole idea work. I don't understamd, I see posts that date back to 2019, how can this have survived as long as it did if all this time it has had so many problems?

Ad timers. Hmm, I bet maybe virus checkers could be probably hating it Ad blockers would probably break it outright. Well, I'm not turning my virus checker off with anything that runs ads, so guess I'm SOL. But hey, being down only 99 cents to learn this isn't a big deal at least. Good luck with your service.

Is the Steam version going to have ads? Because ye gods, If that happens, then it's leaving my wishlist faster than... a really fast thing. And trust me, the negative review storm will make Hurricane Irma look like a light drizzle.

EDIT: I got it to work again, but only after jumping through plenty of hoops. It \\_wanted\\_ me to disable my entire antivirus and wasn't accepting simply adding an exception for the site. That's a red flag, my friends. It means that it thinks something in your ad display routine is suspicious, even if it's not an actual positive. That, or it's tagging something from the source of the ads themselves, and after looking at all the sites the ads are being pulled from, I am not planning to stop blocking many of those sites - at least one out of every three were in my red no-no list. If we absolutely must have ads, how about a list of trust-able sources we can choose from?

Anyways, once I switched back to my trial account, the ads seemed to disappear. Do the ads only exist for free users, and the problem is that somehow the code it is affecting the paid users as well?

I can't say I experienced any of the glitches other users are reporting (or, if I *have* experienced any glitches, I didn't realize they were glitches), but I also can't say that I find 30 second pop-up ads every several actions (like, every 8 or so) to be particularly unintrusive. Those ads are too frequent, too long, and too immersion-breaking for my liking. This also isn't helped by the fact that I already sometimes have to retry 10 or more times to actually get a reasonable response out of Griffin.

Also, and I'm saying this here for the sake of not having to make a separate reply to one of your other comments, but I saw you say that purchasing the Steam version will also remove ads from all of the other versions of the game. The thing is, in that case, I can't help but wonder *why* the option of a one-time purchase is exclusive to Steam. I feel like a lot people buying the Steam version *will never actually use* the Steam version, instead opting to use the mobile and/or browser versions, now without ads.

Additionally, some people literally don't have a PC, and only play on mobile. For those people, it doesn't seem like using Steam for the one-time purchase to remove ads is an option. Some people also actively choose *not* to use Steam. Even people outside of those two groups will still have to go through the extra hurdle of having to make the purchase through Steam, and possibly having to make a Steam account if they don't already have one, which may turn some people off of buying the Steam version.

Aside from that, won't Valve also be taking a cut of the money made from the Steam version? Unless I'm missing something, it seems like Latitude would make more money from one-time purchases made through the browser version (I'm not sure about the app versions, though), rather than ones made through the Steam version. My point is, though, would it not be beneficial, both, for Latitude, *and* for the players, to have the option of a one-time purchase to remove ads available on the browser and mobile versions as well?","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-06-17-211650","1655493410","None","False","0","icqyngt","False","t3_vdzay3","False","t1_icqyngt","False","t1_ico0gvb","/r/AIDungeon/comments/vdzay3/introducing_endless_ai_dungeon/icqyngt/","1656896583","5","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

Why did energy exist, do you think? It was a cost saving measure to protect us from users consuming more AI compute than we can afford. So, the choice here isn't no ads vs ads. It's ads vs a rate limiting system. Both of those are cost mitigating solutions. Energy wasn't a fun game mechanic, but a cost measure. I think everyone understood that. So, our choice to put a limit on free play to manage costs isn't new, just different. That was how we started our blog post, by saying energy was in place to manage AI consumption, and Ads is the next iteration. 

We weren't interested in ads. We have blog posts saying we're not going to explore it. Users have been requesting ads instead, since ads make it so play doesn't have to stop. Ever. At some point we had to look into it more given the interest.

There are also quite a few people in those comments who very clearly *did not* want ads, or who would only be okay with ads if the ads weren't disruptive (which the current ads *are*), and/or gave some sort of bonus, like extra scales.

I also don't think the second post is a good representation of what players thought about energy as of recent; that post was from back when energy was initially introduced and had a maximum of only 100. In the time since the maximum energy was increased to 2000, I've only seen a few people complain about energy. The third post also *did not* ask for ads, even if they were complaining about energy, and most of the commenters were fine with, or at least understanding of, the decision to add energy. Even the commenters on that post that complained about energy didn't suggest ads as an alternative.

In regards to the second post, it's also worth noting that people were unaware of Latitude's financial issues back then, and that Latitude had also just recently added microtransactions in the form of scales. Because of this, a *lot* of users perceived the situation as Latitude simply being greedy by severely limiting how much you can play the game and by trying to get you to buy scales to refill energy.

However, then Latitude decided to be more transparent about their financial situation, increased the maximum energy to 2000, and also introduced daily rewards as a way to get scales without paying actual money. After that, people were generally much more understanding of the circumstances behind Latitude's recent decisions, and far fewer players were having issues with energy.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-06-17-232408","1655501048","None","1655503762.0","0","icrfp0n","False","t3_vef1f4","False","t1_icrfp0n","True","t1_icqnoeo","/r/AIDungeon/comments/vef1f4/serous_question/icrfp0n/","1656896187","3","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

Thank you. We've been monitoring and listening to all the feedback today, and I feel like your post does a good job summarizing the pain points of the way ads work today, as well as some of the leading suggestions for how we could improve it.

A couple things I'll share:

* We adjusted ad frequency. You seem to have seen it every 5 actions. It should be much less frequent now.
* Yeah...bugs. We had a few today. We somewhat expected that, and our team worked long hours today resolving many of them. There are one or two lingering, but most have been resolved.
* We're open to many of the suggestions you (and others) have made. We plan to improve and iterate. This is only the beginning. 

Today was a lot of listening. We'll come back soon with plans for where we will take this next. Really appreciate this.

Although, even then, most of the commenters were either against ads, or wanted ads in conjunction with energy. Also, the description of the request has kind of a different meaning from the title. It reads:

*Ads as a part of the free version of AI Dungeon to give free players to gain energy or other premium benefits. No ads for premium subscribers.*

The important part is the part about using ads to gain energy. That implies that energy would stay, and ads would simply be able to refill energy. My guess is that the title was meant to say that you could watch ads to replace the energy you've lost, because that's the only interpretation of the title that doesn't contradict with the description.

I wouldn't be surprised if a large portion of the people who voted for that request, did so solely because of the description.

I have to agree that no one would have voted to watch ads every few actions regardless of all else.

This might even be worth letting the devs know, as they might be confused right now, since they thought this is what people wanted.

With the current system, the majority of users who never had issues with energy, now have to deal with ads. For those users, the current system makes the experience outright worse; their experience was previously entirely unhindered by energy, but is now hindered by ads. Those players would remain unhindered by a system where energy still exists, but can be replenished by watching ads. For players that *did* have issues with running out of energy, they would be able to simply watch ads to replenish energy. That's not all that much different, functionally, from being forced to watch ads at random intervals to keep playing, like with the current system.

As for the second paragraph, people haven't been hating on advertising for the past year, because ads literally weren't in the game until a few days ago. There weren't any ads to hate until very recently. Aside from that, basically all of the people I've seen suggest ads, either wanted them to refill energy, wanted to be able to watch ads in exchange for scales or other benefits, or wanted banner ads.

Now the scales I’ve been saving up have no real use and the ads constantly ruin my immersion.
Energy gave me a good indicator of when to maybe stop  or take a break from writing after a long session and go do something else.

The mandatory, pushy and frequent nature of these ads are significantly decreasing the retention of my attention to Aidungeon. It consistently shatters my immersion when the “Ad in…” thing pops up in the screen, the ad itself severing my ties to any sort of writing flow I had achieved.

I remember reading on the form that the ads would not replace energy. I must have been mistaken.

Internally, every time ads came up the response was ""no way!"". But we just started getting so many requests (through the feature request board, support tickets, direct email, Discord, surveys, etc) that we said we should give it another look. It was a pretty slow process before we finally came around to the idea.

The fact that energy limited play has always bothered us. I'd say that was the part of ads that was most intriguing to us, that people could continue to play without needing to recharge. 

We actually don't have a clear idea how much revenue ads will make, or if they'll cover our costs. Ad revenue varies wildly across the industry, so the only way we'll know for sure is by releasing ads and watching the data. There's a chance it'll be worse for us financially than energy was (if AI usage goes up but the revenue just isn't sufficient). If ads perform well, it actually gives us flexibility to add lots of cool stuff to the free experience.

And in one of those checks, I ran into this problem. So far I have an idea after the release to do an Animal Update where I will add animal information to the world. It will definitely be the biggest One Piece world ever made.

I can remember ads being brought up at the beginning of the energy system development, but I don’t think I’ve seen it come up much since. I think even I proposed ads because energy hadn’t officially come out and I expected it to be much worse. I’ve never had an issue with it though. I use it so little and for such short periods I was almost always at max. I don’t know the financial side, but I would like a toggle in settings. One way, you’ve got the energy system (maybe even with less energy if they have to) and the other with ads. This way, if you’re like me and basically never play, you don’t have to be interrupted by ads. However, if you play a lot and are always running out of energy, the ad method allows you to keep going, but with ads every so often.

If the ads must stay, can the on screen time be reduced by like five seconds? Not sure why, but it feels a tad too long. Like, I’ve noticed the AI generated an output but the ad stays for like five seconds after before disappearing. Maybe there’s some requirements they have to meet, but if possible, at least shorten the ad time by five seconds. Also, maybe redoing an action shouldn’t build towards the ad? I know the redoing still requires the AI to work, but I don’t know, most of my stuff is hitting redo, so it’s kinda annoying to be getting ads and not really getting anywhere story-wise.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-06-19-175945","1655654385","None","False","0","icyfddj","False","t3_vfoelv","False","t1_icyfddj","False","t3_vfoelv","/r/AIDungeon/comments/vfoelv/now_all_of_this_energy_is_useless_thx_latitude/icyfddj/","1656890415","22","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

The most expensive parts of their service are probably the costs of any payments to AI21 and the electricity company, ignoring things like potential taxes and wages. They make enough in donations alone to likely cover electricity, and so I'd say we can nix that concern. The 3 million in seeded donations is enough to cover the many Dragon-tier servers they have, like 60K$ per server. Griffin servers are more like 13K$, all this not accounting for bulk or business-tier discounts.

And again, they dropped the Classic model from use because apparently running base GPT-2 was too expensive compared to revenue from traffic.

But yeah, anyway going further into AI21: I dunno what models AIDungeon uses, so assuming they went big with Dragon on Jumbo it's 0.25$ to generate 1K tokens of text and 0.005$ per call to the API. So, I mean... So if I understand things correctly: At 30$/month, and I think they want more these days, it'd take 200 uses to cost 1$ from API calls and 4K tokens of output to cost 1$ in outputs. That's like 100K tokens of output, 600K characters, to reach that 30$.

(Edit: I read Voyage is 15$/month, so in that particular case I could fathom the idea that ~300K characters per month, or about 10K characters of output per day, might lag behind the average usage. I don't know though. 2000 words per day or so.)

As for free users, well, they are limited in uses, limited in customization, and have their data sold through like a dozen trackers to all takers.

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&amp;c.**, **&amp;c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

To me, the issue isn't that they need ads.  Mistakes and unforeseen circumstances happen.  AI is particularly expensive, so of course this was bound to happen eventually, and in fact, I'm surprised they were able to go this long without it.  The issue is that they often don't communicate, and even when they do (again, in my opinion) they're very misleading, to the point of bordering on dishonesty.  And while mistakes are something I can sympathize with, understand and handle, dishonesty, shadiness and lack of communication is a much harder pill for me to swallow.

In their post they mention that a full 80% of players surveyed support ads, and that their testing group gave them feedback.  But looking at the feedback we're seeing, I think it's safe to say that something don't add up here, chief.  A lot of players seem more than a little disgruntled and very blind-sided, but they voted for this, right?  Well, in the survey, they voted for ads in favor of energy, but they weren't told what form that would take.  I'm sure a lot of people were thinking banner ads - not full stop 30 second ads in the middle of playing every ten or so generations.  And what about the testing group?  Did... did they really okay this?

Of course, none of this was mentioned in the post.  But hey - no big deal, lesson learned.  Growth opportunity, right?  Next time they'll be better at communicating these sorts of things.

But this is a company that has done the same thing many, *many* times.  Energy system, deletion of explore, OpenAI's Dragon model being axed, friggin filtergeddon with too much to list (even though some of it may be attributed to OpenAI) where they just dipped with no warning for two months, all where they dropped things out of the blue on their playerbase with no warning.  And the kicker is, they never learn from it.  If they had, they would've clued people in a little more.  Giving maybe a week's warning before doing something like this, telling people that ads would be thirty second interruptions every fifteen actions.  But they didn't.

It sucks since I actually thought they were shaping up.

Broadly speaking I agree with you. I will admit that my passion has gotten the better of me at certain points and there's been a lot of pointless verbal jousting, venting, trolling, vicious personal attacks and dick waving that ultimately doesn't go anywhere but karma bombing and As a longtime fan of this to begin with and having an interest in the other various AI powered storytelling apps and the concept as a whole, AI Dungeon captured my imagination like no other. 


However... 


As somebody who loves this platform, and I can feel dispassionately address in part, we felt betrayed by the changes that were made in altering the filter which for a while rendered the game unplayable. Then, there was the change to the different provider for Dragon that was no longer run with OpenAI, which had a noticeable change in the nature and quality of the replies given; less coherent, less engaging, interpreting world info strangely, and honestly, just stupid at times. This has been rectified somewhat by the introduction of the wyvern model, however that's still kind of hit or miss. And now, there's the addition of rather brutally implemented ads in lieu of energy and pervasive tech problems on the app. 


All of these things are bad on their own, but perhaps worst of all, all of them have been done with zero input from the community, and at times, especially in the case of be disastrous launch of the new filter to try to meet OpenAI usage standards, were openly mocked in a PR move that I would call absolutely brain-dead; either not correctly interpreting the concerns of fans of users but downplaying them, making them feel...well, making them feel like they were hated and being used for money.


Which brings us to where we are today and your point. Due to what feels like exploitation, contempt and an overall lack of meaningful communication between the users and the creators, a lot of good will has been sucked away from the community, leaving a lot of bitterness, frustration and in many cases outright unhinged hatred (saw somebody in another thread said that the creator was probably abusive to his family because of how he implements ads. Seriously, what the fuck?) Anyhow, combine that with the internet being what it is, and read it being what it is, and it becomes an intense negative echo chamber which is self-reinforcing. And honestly, trolling is fun. Just hop non your alt and fuck shit up for an hour or so. Righteous anger gives serotonin and a feeling of camaraderie with others. Many of the people who were once happy and supportive of this had become bitter and disillusioned because of how this has all progressed. Expressing feelings like this is cathartic. I've tried to be constructive, emailing the Creator's, trying to leave more constructive comments, but I have to admit, even I get pissed off sometimes and I wonder about the future of this platform.


In conclusion, a lot of us feel like there have been broken promises, changes that we didn't ask for, contempt from a totally brain-dead Discord moderator that really poisoned the well for a lot of people, and the fact that anger has been very cathartic to people here and has now become part of the culture of the subreddit. That's where the pessimism comes from. I on the whole think that this could have been all expressed and done in a much more constructive manner, but I think that the pessimism isn't entirely unjustified. However I think it's important to remember that this is an evolving platform and an evolving technology overall and we are watching it crawl, stumble, walk, and run in real time, with creators at this point who are just trying to keep the damn lights on while things move ahead.

Our frustrations could have been handled much better, much more constructively , however, they they should not be ignored, and they must be understood, the pessimism that we already have increases and the well is poisoned forever. There is still a future however, as long as everybody is willing to work together, exercise some restraint and at least attempt to engage in good faith. This can't be done overnight but the time to start is now if we want things to improve.


Tl:Dr our pessimism is understandable, perhaps even justified, but it could have gone much, much better. Once bitten, twice shy. But just because there's pessimism doesn't mean that there isn't a future as long as it can be addressed and people work together rather than tear it down.

I agree.  
I was MutatedNooby on here before, practically lived on this subreddit.  
Computer borked and I forgot password so I have this one, I had no issues with this subreddit, I just didn't recover it.  
I was incredibly active, and I had seen this app go through the ups and downs, as well as the deeper digging of the hole. This app has helped me get better at expressing myself as well as improving as a writer, so I do have some appreciation for what they've done.   
It's just unfortunate that it's always handled so poorly.  


You know what they say, once bitten twice shy, and the community has been bitten many times, it's amazing that they're still trying to pet/feed the Latitude.  


Jokes aside, if I could do a one time payment thing, and I knew they wouldn't just leak the damn info, I'd probably do that rather quickly, even just for Griffin, still mad, but I do still find some amusement from this product.  
Eh, we're all trying to grow.  
Bah humbug.

From your comments it's pretty clear you don't like us given past history, which I can't blame you for. Frustrating stuff. 

But I can tell you we are focused on making adjustments to the ways ads are working. We already fixed around a dozen reported bugs (those device specific ones can be hard to find without testing at scale on mobile apps). We adjusted timing so that ads are less frequent and not as long on certain platforms. And we have a number of other adjustments coming this week.

The website suffers from the same problem, but at least it’s quick. However, sometimes JavaScript leaks into the prompt, leading the AI to generate more of it. I’m sure I don’t have to go into detail about best front end practices and how mixing code and user data is s BAD BAD BAD.

Although it does make you wonder what they're doing that that would be possible in the first place. Most you might usually expect is if they've malformed the world info json objects or something, and are feeding that in, causing it to create more, but actual code seems... odd.

Comparing this situation to the events of earlier this year, I would say that we as consumers and users of AI Dungeon have actually gained from this change as it allows for a sustainable business model for Latitude, thus, allowing AI Dungeon to remain free for all. It is truly saddening to see so many people immediately jump ship at the first sign of a disagreement, not realizing that nothing is truly free, even in a free game.

True, but with the launch of a PC edition of the game, I wonder if the developers might not have been able to offer a self-hosted/local version of the game that ran a bit slower, but was otherwise just as good. For something like Griffin, which is presumably still GPT-2 (needs about 4GB of RAM, according to KoboldAI, a self-hosted version of the same), it should have been doable on most mid-range modern computers.

That would have been able to lighten the load a lot, if not remove it completely for users that aren't likely to pay for higher tier services, bu are still able to run the steam version.

&gt;	However, this does not mean I agree with these new advertising practices, as I’ve seen many people on here say, 30-second unskippable ads are frankly quite ridiculous. I have zero issue watching ads if it means that this pretty great game remains free for all to use, and I will likely continue to struggle through these obnoxious ads, but there are also many who will be turned away. Honestly, I will continue to play AI Dungeon as long as it remains free, despite the irritation, and I am sure that I am not alone in that sentiment. But we should remember that being pessimistic about the whole situation accomplishes nothing. Instead, we should go about making our voices heard by Latitude in a constructive and mature way.

As someone who doesn't use AI Dungeon that much (about once a month on mobile), and was basically blindsided by a surprise ad, I would have preferred it if they had been less obtrusive. Them being pop-up ads both annoyed me, and made me think that I'd somehow infected my device with malware from some source or other.

I understand that they pay less, but the user experience might have been better if they either limited play and ran banner ads, or only had a pop-up when starting/leaving a game.

We’ve been pleasantly surprised how excited players are for ads! In addition to gathering feedback from our testing group and our Discord community, we recently surveyed AI Dungeon players. We found that the majority of players prefer ads vs the energy system. A full 80% of our players support developers using ads to cover the costs of free game play.

80% of which players exactly?  You mention in the first sentence that they were excited for this - how did you determine this?  How did you survey them, and would you say the survey was conducted in such a fashion that they had a good idea of what the new system would entail and how it would work well before you rolled it out?  Also, were they explicitly told the ads would be interstitial ads rather than banner ones?  If not, with all due respect, the statement that players are excited for and support this system is incredibly misleading to me.

I would also really appreciate being clued in a bit more in the future for major changes like this.  Even just a quick heads up a few days beforehand, describing what you're going to roll out, and how you're going to roll it out and what it'll look like, would be such a huge help, and this is something Latitude has historically struggled with, at least in my experience.  Competitors like NovelAI have these sorts of announcements for big changes for all of their big community hubs - reddit, discord, on the landing page itself, and, for me at least, it helps me to feel like I'm an active part of the community, and I never feel blind-sided by any particular change or update.

Lastly, while I'm not going to lie, this entire experience has deeply soured my opinion of Latitude as a whole after I began giving them another chance, I do actually appreciate both you and Ryan for at least going and talking to the community.  That being said, I would appreciate answers to some of these questions.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-06-21-001416","1655763256","None","1655772263.0","0","id41alg","False","t3_vgd6wb","False","t1_id41alg","True","t1_id3rb5i","/r/AIDungeon/comments/vgd6wb/why_so_many_pessimists_warning_long_and_full_of/id41alg/","1656885779","3","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

After following the AID train for over two years, I can say that what infuriates me the most is not necessarily the mistake they make in themselves, but how they handle it and communicate around it. And this has been a longtime and recurring issue. They implement/remove a new feature with little to no notice or explanation beforehand, and when asked wtf this is all about, it's always the same responses ""the users asked for it, we got great feedback from the testers blahblahblah"" but when you actually look into it, their polls and whatever tools they use to get feedback or judge satisfaction levels are often misleading and flawed. Each time, they get backlash for how they handle things, each time they go ""oh this is an opportunity to learn, we'll do better next time"". But does it ever change? They never communicate quite honestly. There's always this sense of manipulating the truth, tweaking it a so it looks better for them, kinda gaslighting the playerbase, or just simply being tone deaf sometimes. It's kind of mind-boggling, really. 

If it wasn't for all of this, I'd be more inclined to be tolerant and understanding of their choices. I did at the beginning. I was one of the few people who weren't jumping to bash them at the start of the filter debacle, and was just saying ""they'll fix it, it's not so bad"". But look where we are now. When you take all of this into account, and add it to the undeniable drop of quality and general unstability of their product, it just becomes infuriating, and is obviously going to make a lot of people bitter.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-06-21-012247","1655767367","None","1655767567.0","0","id49x7a","False","t3_vgd6wb","False","t1_id49x7a","False","t1_id13fu7","/r/AIDungeon/comments/vgd6wb/why_so_many_pessimists_warning_long_and_full_of/id49x7a/","1656885568","4","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

The main problem is that the ads are incredibly intrusive, particularly on mobile.

&gt;Hey, all!  
Please note the following bug-fixes, optimizations, and updates to the AI Dungeon experience.  
Changes to ads based on player feedback:  
\\- Ads should be shorter and load less frequently  
\\- Fixed bug so that AI generations will happen in the background while ads are shown  
\\- Resolved several bugs including some that would cause the ads not to load or prevent gameplay  
\\- Broader changes to the ad system are being discussed. More to be announced later.  
Resolved the following issues affecting some of our users:  
\\- Output not shown following an action.  
\\- Story stopped scrolling when opening the keyboard on native apps.  
\\- Buttons in World Character Creation weren’t responding.  
\\- Profile Page loaded a new screen upon filter change.  
\\- Pressing “Enter” submitted an action instead of inserting a new line.  
\\- Action loading caused the story text to shift slightly.  
\\- Some user profile names not showing up on content cards.  
\\- Unsubscribe page unresponsive for certain Stripe Subscriptions.  
Optimization:  
\\- We’ve made a number of optimization improvements across AI Dungeon. You should see faster loading on the Home, Search, Profile, and Settings screens as well as smoother interactions with the sidebar menu and auto-scrolling on stories.  
Other Changes:  
\\- Profile edits now happen on Voyage.  
\\- “/commands” (/say, /do, /story, /remember, etc.) don’t require pressing “return” to work anymore and should feel more responsive.  
If you run into any trouble following these updates, please let us know in bugs.aidungeon.io or the #aid-feedback channel on Discord.

And we're talking through a few options for how to let players 'save up' ad watches for those who want more immersion in the free experience.

They also both have free trials. NovelAI generally is considered to be the better of the two, but HoloAI isn't bad, and it's pretty much the cheapest paid AI application there is.

As far as free alternatives go, I'd say to try the [KoboldAI Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/KoboldAI/KoboldAI-Client/blob/main/colab/TPU.ipynb). You can also run AI models locally, and if you *do* want to do that, then the [KoboldAI client](https://github.com/koboldai/koboldai-client) is a good frontend for doing so. Although, chances are that your PC can't run any decent models locally, hence why I mentioned the Colab before the client itself.

[Dreamily](https://dreamily.ai/) exists. It's fine, I guess, at least in terms of output quality. Just note that there have been some concerns regarding privacy with Dreamily, mainly because of the Dreamily ToS having once literally stated that they would monitor private stories to crack down on the use of slurs, whilst also saying that they'd be sharing your info with third parties.

NovelAi has a text adventure mode, but the output is meh and it doesn't have supporting features like Worlds built-in. In terms of pricing, the cheapest is $10/mo and that feels a bit high for what you get.

HoloAi is basically for story writing only. So far it's had some of the worst Ai responses for me. But it's also the cheapest at $5/mo.

I am highly suspicious of Dreamily. It's totally free which means that you are not their actual customer. Who is? No one knows.

AiD is now at least $15/mo as part of Voyage (which is in beta) and it has the most supporting features BUT the Ai is not good and everything is constantly breaking.

I don't really think it's *massively* better than AID's best model (as in, Wyvern) in terms of output, but I *do* still find the outputs to be somewhat better nonetheless. The main things that put NovelAI above AID for me are just the sheer amount of options and features available. I also find editing to be a lot more intuitive than in AID, and the lorebook to be more intuitive than AID's current implementation of World Info. It helps that NovelAI is also simply more reliable than AID in the sense that it doesn't constantly break.

I also don't find HoloAI to be particularly spectacular or anything. I definitely don't think it's bad, but I don't think it really stands out in terms of output quality or features. I guess it's cool that it can generate multiple outputs at a time, but that's not really a feature exclusive to HoloAI (off the top of my head, I know that Dreamily, Hyperwrite, and Voyage's Loom have the same feature). The main appeal of HoloAI is definitely just how cheap it is.

Yeah, I was considering editing my comment in regards to Dreamily, specifically to mention the fact that Dreamily has seemingly *no* monetization; no ads, no microtransactions, no subscriptions, or anything else. I remembered that this, combined with Dreamily having once openly said in their ToS that they would share your info with third party companies, led to quite a few people suspecting that Dreamily was selling user data.

The creator of Dreamily denied that they were selling user data (and then tried to accuse the people with such suspicions of being racist; this literally happened on this subreddit), and although some users believed him, he failed to convince some others. After all, if Dreamily has no monetization, then how *are* they able to continue providing their service for free? Even if Dreamily's creator was being truthful in saying that they don't sell user data, then that just further begs the question of how Dreamily is able to stay afloat.

In regards to AID, what do you mean by ""supporting features""? If you're referring to the other applications included in Voyage, then I guess I'm inclined to agree with the statement that it has the most supporting features (even if it seems like the vast majority of the community doesn't care about Voyage whatsoever). If you mean that AID, as a standalone application, has the most features, then I'd have to disagree; NovelAI just has a *lot* of features.

I am specifically talking about stuff like the explore page, the Scenario system, Worlds, and World Data.

IMO AiD's biggest weakness is probably the management. The alternatives seem to have much tighter QA and project management. With AiD it's pretty clear that they haven't hit an equilibrium and they make big changes frequently. And the changes have been questionable.

As far as your comment about being able to host GPT-2 for free, sure you can, but try doing that on the scale that Latitude does and watch how fast your PC crashes. Scaling that up to support a massive free user base is where that argument crumbles.

Yes, it is still possible to keep doing things the old way, but it's not wrong of Latitude to decide that they want to be compensated for their efforts instead. Telling Latitude that your condition for staying is that you expect to use their service for nothing won't get you anywhere.

EDIT: I will say that personally don't like them having ads either, so my suggestion to Latitude if they no longer want to support a free version without ads would be to remove it and switch to something that's closer to NovelAI's model.

Fair point on Steam. We likely can/will have a non-Steam version too for people who don't want to use steam. We haven't offered a one-time purchase in the past because it took us time to build a sustainable one-time-purchase offering. 

Subscriptions certainly are the darling of investors :). We think the one-time purchase will be most appealing to people who are free players, who don't want a subscription. So, it's addressing a different audience. 

Steam does take a cut, but they are also a discovery channel, which could help more people find AI Dungeon. So, in that regard, the 30% cut is a cost worth spending on if it helps us find new players.

It has a ton of potential, but needs to be tuned. The actual dragon model (at least in my adventures) has been really good at remembering details and personality traits. It can also handle abstract concepts pretty well. The catch is that you have to adjust the settings and hold its hand a little by prompting it with small story inputs. For example, if you ask Dragon to describe something, it'll give a fairly short description unless you force it to continue. It only takes 2 or 3 words, like if its describing a knight, I could enter ""He is wearing"" and it'll keep describing the knight. And you won't have to push it further to keep going most of the time. 

Dragon also doesn't have the same goofy humor that OpenAi's Dragon had. For example, in the older model, it wasn't uncommon to have the Ai do stuff like give a wizard a cell phone or have dead characters talk. The newer Dragon model tends to have a more serious tone. It can make jokes and funny moments, but it lacks that silliness that made AiDungeon famous 2 or 3 years ago. Personally, I'm ok with that, but it might not be everyone's cup of tea. The other thing is that Dragon is VERY slow compared to other Ai out there. Each Dragon action takes around 2 to 5 seconds to process. sometimes longer.

But even with Dragon being what it is, I think the biggest problem is how Latitude runs things. They make a lot of changes and don't announce them all, even changes to the models. AiDungeon is slowly being shoved into Voyage despite player resistance and a severe lack of transparency about Voyage. I don't think anyone is convinced that Latitude's management is actually connected to the Playerbase at this point. Its hard to recommend AiDungeon to anyone with all that going on.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-06-21-215415","1655841255","None","False","0","id7wpbb","False","t3_vglcc1","False","t1_id7wpbb","False","t1_id7df5b","/r/AIDungeon/comments/vglcc1/return_no_yes_no/id7wpbb/","1656882567","1","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

The idea that i got from the feedback poll was that we would be swapping to ads not to have unlimited energy (seeing as the grand mayority of users never ran into energy problems due to how abundant it was) but rather to have access to premium features in exchange for watching ads.

personally, i find that you guys misunderstood your own polls, it wasnt that people were excited to see ads, is that people *Were willing to stomach ads in exchange for something else* atleast from how the wording from the 3rd question implied

i understand that this is probably a measure related to money, atleast from my own limited understanding of buisness, as the first question struck me as a *""We are in a bad financial situation, so therefore pick worse energy system or ADS""* but releasing ads with no extra flair to make it \\*Feel\\* better for the users who are getting popup ads mid adventure was in my opinion your greatest mistake.

&amp;#x200B;

another matter is that i personally never expected Pop Up ads to be the ads that we get, i expected some sort of sidebar ad on the side that would exist there passively, which i find is another reason why this is backfiring so much.

&amp;#x200B;

Another matter is that the poll wasnt ""*Do you prefer ADS or Energy* "" like you guys are saying in your blogpost

the poll was ""Would you rather have a even MORE limited energy than now, Or ADS"" which probably prompted people like me to figure out ""id rather have a ad somewhere in the screen rather than have to wait hours for my energy to come back""","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-06-22-015308","1655855588","None","1655856679.0","0","id8rn3m","False","t3_vh11z4","False","t1_id8rn3m","True","t1_id4twm8","/r/AIDungeon/comments/vh11z4/why_just_why/id8rn3m/","1656881860","2","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

but keep in mind, the questions were slightly different, from memory (since i was one of the people who voted)

The question was something along the lines of

*""Would you rather have ads, or a even more limited energy than now?"" |* it wasnt a matter of what you prefered, the question struck me as **""Okay guys, we are losing money, so we either nerf your energy, or we put ads""**

which i personally chose ads, because i would rather be interrupted by an ad for 30 seconds rather than i have to wait for hours for energy to recharge.

there were also other questions that implied that ads would allow the devs to enchance the free user experience, which is why i chose ads myself.

Point is, similarly to with the vaguely worded poll that Latitude made, the people who voted for the feature request also *probably* weren't expecting the ads to be implemented as they currently are. I can't really find any evidence of people who voted for ads wanting an ad system like the one we got. By the way, if you're curious, according to Latitude's [blog post](https://latitude.io/blog/introducing-endless-ai-dungeon), the specific question on the survey that 80% of users voted ""yes"" to was ""Are you in support of game developers covering the costs of free game play by showing ads?"".

I *have* seen a few people since the addition of ads that preferred the current system over the energy system, but the current system isn't the only system that would please those people. A system that allows you to watch ads to restore energy, as was suggested in the feature request, and which has also been suggested quite a few times in this subreddit, would also allow those people to play infinitely at the cost of having to watch ads (so, the experience for those people would be pretty much the same as it is now, except the other group of people who didn't have issues with energy, wouldn't have to deal with frequent ad breaks). Same for a system where you could choose between energy and ads.

Also, I'm pretty sure the survey was just at the top of the AID home page, where the info about updates, merch, subscriptions, etc., is constantly scrolling by. I'm also pretty sure they did a Google Form because AID doesn't seem to have any built-in way for them to give polls or surveys. They probably didn't see a reason to program such a feature when the feature would rarely be used, anyways, especially when there are already third-party platforms for polls and surveys.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-06-22-053815","1655869095","None","False","0","id9i7bp","False","t3_vhjmjo","False","t1_id9i7bp","False","t1_id987og","/r/AIDungeon/comments/vhjmjo/is_there_any_evidence_that_the_player_base/id9i7bp/","1656881246","7","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

I think those saying that this isn't what they expected are more than fair. Not our intention to pull the rug out and looking back we could have definitely rolled this out much more smoothly.

As some have said the question was ""As an AI Dungeon player, would you rather...  
Have limited Energy (even more limited than today) that needs to recharge between actions  
Have ads replace Energy in exchange for unlimited actions""

One good piece of news I can share is that we've heard very clearly the request for saving up actions through ad watching. This seems like it could be a nice balance for sustaining the free play offering and enabling players to have more control over when they watch ads and how immersed in stories they can be. Another idea on our shortlist is using scales for actions vs ads. Other concepts include how we might share more benefits in the future with free play contributing more vs being subsidized by the subscriber base. 

Happy to answer any other questions or hear ideas for way you'd like to see ads adjust. We're pushing on this daily and you should continue to see adjustments this week. Take care all.

Its users largely migrated to [KoboldAI](https://koboldai.org) which can mostly do the same thing if you know what settings to use.

Once you got KoboldAI installed (Which is far easier since we have an offline installer that does the job for you) you will need to do a few small tweaks for the AI Dungeon experience. First of all you will want one of the models listed as an Adventure model in the menu. The ones that are also named Adventure are replica's of the one from Clover edition but we have better ones to. I can especially recommend Nerys but Nerys does not use Adventure mode by default.

So to use Nerys as AI Dungeon you will need to go to the settings tab after it is done loading and then enable Adventure mode to get the action mode. First write the opening to your story similar to how custom prompts work in the other stuff. Write it from a You perspective. After that you can play the story but unlike clover edition Kobold uses the style of AI Dungeon Unleashed (My old fork). So instead of ""fight the dragon"" you'd type ""You fight the dragon"" so the AI knows who you are refering to. This allows you to have better control over other characters since unlike Clover we don't assume every action is for you.

Compared to Clover you now have something that is a lot more customizable, can run more models properly for a wider taste of AI's, can be scripted, further tuned with addons for the models (softprompts), has much better world info management and more. You can also try it out for free on [Google Colab](https://koboldai.org/colab).","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-06-22-090507","1655881507","None","False","0","ida0aio","False","t3_vgbxs8","False","t1_ida0aio","True","t3_vgbxs8","/r/AIDungeon/comments/vgbxs8/is_there_a_2022_version_of_how_to_install_and_run/ida0aio/","1656880842","2","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

The reality of it is, NAI has much much more to offer for paid users, because all they need to manage are paid users, but with AID, a lot of the time the developers spend is how to make the free version stay free while not being too annoying and still making money. 

NAI can focus on bringing the best experience to all its users, but it's harder trying to balance free and paid with AID. That's why ads exist.

This issue is being fixed though, Voyage provides features that NAI doesnt. To Me, NAI is like a combination of AID and Voyage Loom, buy voyage also provides AI Art, Things, Pixel This, and my personal favourite, Medival Problems, along with both AID Gold+ and Voyage Loom.

Yeah there’s definitely an issue with seeing ads more frequently than the normal amount, I’ve been getting an ad with every action for the last day or so when I was initially only getting an ad every 5-6 actions. There’s also a bug with world info where I press generate on world info and it generates world info as it’s doing the loading circle thing, and then once the loading circle thing is done loading, it completely changes what it said initially while it was still loading. Like it generates a description for that attribute, as it’s loading, and then completely changes what it had just generated once it’s done loading. I’ve no idea if that makes sense but I can’t really think of another way of what I’m trying to say. I’m playing on iPhone btw.

If I could as well, I’d like to make a suggestion for both world info and ads as they are in their current state and what I’d like to see changed about them. For world info, instead of having separate sections for characters, factions, locations, etc., have world info as just one big section without the categories. I think that might make it more streamlined and easier to use, especially for new users. From experience, I was confused and intimidated by the different sections in world info when I first started using it and still am unclear what to put for some of them, and I just think they’re unnecessary. To add to the changes of world info, I think not being bound by a set character limit in the boxes would benefit it greatly and would extend its potential as you can generate as much information as you want, the more descriptive you are the better the quality of your story, and a character limit inhibits that. As for ads, instead of having the pop-up ads as they are now, I’d like to see banner ads instead, either on the top or bottom of the page. The pop-up ads just seem very intrusive and very disruptive. I hope you take these suggestions into consideration.

I really like AID and have been playing ever since 2020 and I think what you guys are doing is really interesting and it’s fascinating that this is even possible, but I’ve been steadily decreasing my playtime just because it seems neglected now and community participation and consideration doesn’t seem as important as it once was. I want to see you guys succeed in this, but with everything that’s happened, starting back to last year’s fiasco, the future is looking bleak. I leave a lot of negative comments in these threads, and my Reddit comment history shows that, but I never intend for it to come from a place of hate, it’s constructive criticism and comes from a place of frustration because I care about AID so much.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-06-22-134806","1655898486","None","1655899195.0","0","idalaba","False","t3_vhmlrj","False","t1_idalaba","True","t1_id99x35","/r/AIDungeon/comments/vhmlrj/aid_is_going_to_add_ai_made_profile_pictures_more/idalaba/","1656880362","1","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

As for me, I signed up for NovelAI after Sigurd v2 was released way back when.  The fact that the AI has well surpassed AID's offerings in recent months (at least in my opinion, YMMV) is actually just a bonus for me.  Even if Latitude somehow got access to a model that lived up to the mythical ""Summer Dragon"" quality and more, I'd still use NAI.

Why?  Simple.  Because I don't like giving my money to a corporation that I don't trust.  NAI has earned that, but time after time I'm made to feel like a fool when I start to try to warm up to Latitude again.  And needing ads to stay in business?  That's perfectly fine - I don't actually mind that too much.  I'd daresay it's even expected.

But they didn't frame it that way.  In the original post, they mentioned it as just something the player base wanted instead of energy, no mention of needing money.  In the linked post, they even explicitly denied it.  That and the whole 80% of players approve thing when a lot of the players were completely blindsided by this update, makes me skeptical of how they reached that conclusion.

The issue isn't the what.  If Latitude had discussed this change and how it would roll out before rolling it out in its current form and explaining what they did (the interstitial ads we ended up with), hey, it's all good.  I might still not agree with the final result, but they didn't pull the rug out from under people, signifying a level of trust.  Trust deserves trust in return.  And in particular, if I had the rocky history and reputation Latitude did, well, I'd make extra sure to tread lightly.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-06-22-162830","1655908110","None","False","0","idb3xg1","False","t3_vgw4qk","False","t1_idb3xg1","True","t1_idaddxh","/r/AIDungeon/comments/vgw4qk/theyre_here_to_make_bad_decisions_again/idb3xg1/","1656879932","2","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

NAI is better in a lot of ways, but AID has one thing that NAI doesn't, and that's openness between the developer and the user.

In my time using NAI and participating in NAI discussions, I haven't seen any times that the developers interacted, giving the entire thing a very corporate feel, while AID's discord has multiple channels and threads focused on talking with the devs, asking questions, etc.

Personally, that's something that I really value, AID has a very Indie Game Feel, while NAI is really missing that, NAIs home page seems very ""Look at how amazing our product is!"" while AID doesn't have a homepage, it just pulls you directly into the explore page.

Yes, Voyage is making latitude seem a lot more corporate, but I still trust them more than the anonymous unknown developers on NAI, but that's just my experience.

NAI is better for privacy as far as I know, but if I needed privacy I would just use an open source model locally on my own machine, google and such already know everything about you.

Its up to you which one you choose, but right now specifically with voyage, comparing NAI scroll with Voyage, NAI Provides more in itself as the text generation, aka its main product, while Voyage also offers stuff like Medival Problems, AI Art, Things, and soon, even a portal to develop your own AI games, which will most likely be available as an extra free bonus to paying voyage subscribers, compared to NAI's GooseAI, which costs extra money and isn't even that related to NAI, so even that's a stretch.

However, I admit I haven't been on AID's new Discord after the old one was abandoned - they may well communicate better there than they do on Reddit (apart from the two regulars here, who I legitimately do at least respect for trying, personal distaste toward Latitude aside), I honestly don't know.

NAI does legitimately brand itself as more for writers than gamers, and while I love most things about NAI, the one knock I do have against it is the text adventure mode is significantly worse than the freeform writing mode (though they have made some improvements, it's clearly still an early work in progress).  Oh yeah and the deadlines heh - it's pretty notorious for being a day or two late on some of the big releases.

But man if it doesn't nail it when it comes down to it.  It may be good at one thing (well, maybe more in the coming week, but that's besides the point) but man if it doesn't do it well.  For all of the praise it gets, NAI isn't a perfect product and it likely never will be, but when the developers lay out near-term and yearly road maps, and what we get consistently blows my expectations away, it gets hard for me not to feel at least a little excited for it's future.

At any rate, even though I gave a long spiel, the one thing I will say is if it makes you happy, and you do feel valued, then there's no shame in it.  For me, that's NAI, and for you, that's Voyage.

I've found that it doesn't do text adventures nearly as well. They have a text adventure module but it just isn't the same. It's also pretty overwhelming, especially for new players. Lots of complexity and options. Many of the best creators in their community are hard-core AI aficionados who know their stuff. It can be really intimidating for more casual players.

The ads cover too much of the screen for you to read the outputs during the ads while on mobile. From what I've heard, the app apparently also still has 30 second ads (although I can't personally confirm as the app has been broken for me for over a month).

Anyways, I don't think most people who consider Latitude to be a bad company consider them such necessarily because of any malice on Latitude's part, but because of incompetence on Latitude's part. Latitude has shown incompetence numerous times, not just during the controversy last year, but also after the controversy, and *occasionally* before the controversy. I don't people are taking issue with Latitude because they think Latitude is evil or something, but because of all of the poor decisions they make, and how they often make said poor decisions with little to no communication with the community beforehand about the decisions. It doesn't help that it feels like they never test these huge updates before rolling them out, causing them to launch with a bunch of issues that should've easily been noticed before the release of the update.

I'm also not sure that claiming that Latitude made a whole new AI after OpenAI screwed them over is entirely accurate. They just used an open-source model by EleutherAI and finetuned it using the same dataset as their previous model. I think you're kinda overestimating how much effort that took.

Anyways, aside from that, I understand your perspective when it comes to the ads (at least when it comes to the browser version, since the ads are longer and fill most of the screen on mobile). Although, I still think having energy (possibly somewhat more limited than before, if necessary to save costs) with the option to watch ads to refill energy would kinda be the best of both worlds.

Additionally, I think Latitude could implement some banner ads around the site without too many people taking issue with it. Sure, they wouldn't make Latitude as much money as pop-up ads, but I feel like it'd be a pretty unintrusive way to help cover the costs of running AID. I also think most people would agree with you on liking ads more if they brought premium features to the free version, especially given that one of the most voted features on the feature request site suggested being able to watch ads for premium features.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-06-23-120109","1655978469","None","False","0","idevmgn","False","t3_vis8ns","False","t1_idevmgn","False","t3_vis8ns","/r/AIDungeon/comments/vis8ns/why_i_dont_hate_ads_but_still_think_they_need/idevmgn/","1656876816","6","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

I'm an Opus user because I have a steady source of income, so I'm not the best person to answer this, but I'll try. If you feel torn, think about whether 2048 token context window is worth it compared to the increased cost. One way to do it is to subscribe with the lowest tier ($10/month) and see if it fits your needs. If you find that the 1024 token context window is too limited (in case you want the AI to 'remember' more of the story context, or you have a detailed Lorebook system that can eat up tokens), and your financials allow you, you can upgrade to the middle tier ($15/month) later.

Let me copy-paste some relevant explanation about subscription and upgrading (I may butcher stuff up and confuse you if I use my own words):

&gt;When you subscribe, the subscription is paid immediately and lasts 30 days from the date you subscribed, renewing at that time if not cancelled. Upgrading in the middle [of the subscription period] essentially only charges you for the remaining time in the billing cycle. So yes, you wouldn't be paying extra to upgrade.

&gt;Say you initially subscribed at Tablet tier, which is $10. Half way through the month (15 days) you decide to upgrade to Scroll. You would be charged ~$2.50, as that's difference between the price of the two tiers ($5) divided by the proportion of time remaining (~50%).

2. I see people created poems and lyrics with NAI (even trained custom modules for them), but not sure about the success rate of rhyming (the difficulty with rhyming is true with any AI model from any service, I think). I mean, I did try once and it did rhyme, but that was just for fun (I'm not an artistic person by any means, and I also lack knowledge despite my rambling). Other people in the subreddit I listed may have better answers. You don't have to subscribe to ask questions, so please feel free to do so.

Been using it for a week. The AI is way better in terms of memory, human believability, and narrative direction. For instance, it actually remembered my character’s pronouns, backstory, abilities, and mannerisms from dozens of paragraphs ago. Way more flexible too. I could jump from one time in the narrative to another, a different writing style, and the AI doesn’t get confused, from what I’ve seen.

The thing that you might miss from AID is sharing prompts between community members. It doesn’t have anything like that yet. But then again, you could just steal the prompt from the AID post and paste it into the Dreamily app and get a way better experience, IMO. You can share your stories and have your friends edit them via links and stuff though. Not sure how great the collab function is because I haven’t tried it.

But it’s not a game/dungeon mode kind of thing, as in there’s no DO button or whatever, and the writing style is truly like a book or a fan-fiction. You could try writing out a choose your own adventure kind of story in it though. The app looks like an apple notes app but with a generate button and some writing styles you can choose from. 

And it’s totally free and not a single ad. It really is just a notes app with an AI. The ads and currency were the lethal factors that really drove me off of AID.

Paying customers like myself may want to intensively use the service for a month and pay for it, but maybe in a month when I’m too busy and I know I won’t be using the app or may only use it once or twice, I would cancel my subscription and use the free tier. 


What’s more is that every single person that uses the free version has an incredibly high potential to be turned into a paying customer, *but latitude has to earn that*. 


What are they doing instead? Pushing away all the freebies. Why is that bad, you ask? 

Freebies fund a colossal amount of data into the system, and their eventual conversion to paying customers also funds Latitude to continue the development of this project. Push the freebies away, you’ve lost all the data and a giant chunk of your future growth guarantee. Then Latitude will have no choice but to panic and downsize their company (in half a year’s time if they continue on this path). 


And you can imagine how it goes from here, they make more radical decisions in panic and all of this scandal begins all over again and ends up in Latitude dying.

I explained to another commenter why deterring freebies will be the end of the Ai Dungeon project and Latitude ultimately, I speak from experience and I run two small subscription businesses. 

What’s more is that they make it purposefully difficult to pay for their service. I do not want to subscribe to them using mastercard or visacard, I want to subscribe to them only and only through apple. Just like most of my other subscriptions. For many reasons some obvious some not obvious (one not obvious one being that I’m from Iraq and using mastercard over here is a goddamn nightmare, beginning with the government investigating every transaction and being very touchy about anything NSFW-related.)

And the final point is that whenever you buy a product or a service, a side effect of your purchase is that you are empowering a people. Now, if we’ve learned anything from all other social media and community-related companies, we’d think carefully when we choose who to elect with our $. 

Does Latitude’s careless attitude towards its customers, in its not-so-empowered and vulnerable state of now, make you hopeful about the future of their service? I fear that if their attitude is not corrected, they will not only ruin themselves but also ruin this niche industry including all their competitors in the future.

Have a cheap subscription for lower-end models. 


Get rid of ads altogether, offer 1 month free trial for all subscription models and get rid of the free tier. That’s one possible solution that will help your future growth. 

Or, retain free tier, get rid of ads and lock certain parts of the app behind a subscription pay wall. For example, a free tier only being able to create a couple of adventures and maximum action limit on an adventure being 200 actions or so. Or maybe 300, you know the finances of that better. 

That way your free tier won’t be putting a hole through your finances, and you’ll be giving people a reason to subscribe and ultimately grow a community that is tight-knit and long-lasting. 

Replika has demonstrated a not-perfect but not so bad model of this concept, and they have grown colossally. 

I genuinely (and many people here too) am not here to get anything free out of you, I’m a paying subscriber. But I love this concept and I want competitors to rise and I want this niche to grow and be vibrant. 

If you die out, it’s be a good while of cold winter before the concept gets tried again. 



A good example of this was an app called OpenTalk (later called BuddyTalk) that connected people on random live audiocalls. They could not figure out how to monetize the platform without F’ing the community, they later ended up selling the company for pennies on the dollar and there has not been a single other company taking another shot at that idea so far.

NovelAI has far better prose and is generally more coherent.

But AID feels like a game. And some of the batshit scenarios it comes up with are much more fun than NovelAI.

You're right that a free tier is difficult to support, but we want to provide a free experience. Part of what we feel like we're contributing to the community is allowing more people to experience AI creation, even if they can't afford a subscription. As you know, many other AI platforms have pricy subscriptions. Free players are an important part of our community. And many of them do subscribe, or share AI Dungeon with their friends, who subscribe. 

Our long term vision is to give other creators tools to build experiences like AI Dungeon using AI. For that to work, we need to figure out the free-to-play model and do so in a way that is sustainable for us, and other creators. 

I guess the TL;DR is, we actually think a free tier is important to support, even though it's tricky.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-06-25-023927","1656117567","None","False","0","idmqfkl","False","t3_vj3evp","False","t1_idmqfkl","False","t1_idlr67e","/r/AIDungeon/comments/vj3evp/an_open_letter_to_latitude/idmqfkl/","1656870323","2","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

By comparison NovelAI uses GPT-J-6B for Krake, Fairseq MOE Dense 13B for Euterpe and GPT-NeoX-20B for Krake.

Kobold has all of them (except AI21), but most common is Neo, GPT-J and Fairseq MOE Dense based ones. With OPT likely taking Fairseq's place in the future.

NovelAI users originally found the Fairseq 13B to be close if not better than their 20B. But since 20B got updated that one now seems to be their best. So how a Eurerpe and Kobold compare to Wyvern is hard to say in practise because 20B by default is so close to 13B that it depends on the quality of the finetune to much.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-06-25-193524","1656178524","None","False","0","idpkfe3","False","t3_vk6tte","False","t1_idpkfe3","False","t1_idpfwow","/r/AIDungeon/comments/vk6tte/has_latitude_considered_dropping_free_users/idpkfe3/","1656867979","4","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

Latitudes edge right now over competitors like NovelAI is that they have a free option in the first place.

Imo, profitting from free users with Ads was probably the better option for them fininancially wise, the energy system only served to *limit* free users from draining too much money, but with ads they directly get to profit off free users out right.

there are many AIs going arround that soley profit off ads and are completly free

&amp;#x200B;

their monetization model before was that Free users Drain money, and paying users not only pay for their own drain off the model but also sustain the free users. which honestly i find that was probably unsustaineable in the long run, especailly as AID has likely lost a big chunk of its premium playerbase due to controversy, the amount of premium users probably isnt enough to cover the costs of free users +  premium user drain.

If the energy system had stayed mostly as is, with the option to watch ads to refill energy, that would've been the best compromise, at least in my opinion. People who didn't have issues with energy before, still wouldn't have issues with energy, and also wouldn't be constantly interrupted by ads.

The people who *did* have issues with energy, would be able to play for as long as they want, just at the cost of having to watch ads (as in, what they're already doing). This system would also allow people in the latter group to watch a bunch of ads to stockpile energy *before* playing so that they don't have to be constantly interrupted by immersion-breaking ads *while* playing.

On top of that, the feature request also said that ads would bring premium benefits to free players.

that person has likely not actually looked at any of the info since the very first post talking about dreamily as an alternative.

the creator of dreamily had received the TOS from a firm, since he didnt know how to write them himself. when he was made aware, the TOS changed, and he made that known both on that post, and the dreamily discord.

nor is an account even required to use it.

people had done some digging, and found that there was a 'chinese platform' it was using, but that was the same as google and facebook and the like, they just saw it was 'chinese' and thought dreamily was selling info to the CCP.

which it wasnt. the guy just made dreamily as a passion project, and not enough people use it that he's ever had to do monetization. (though he did say he might end up having to if too many people used it, but that number has not yet been hit).

if you wonder what my source is, i was one of the first people to use dreamily, and if you go to the dreamily discord, all the way at the start, i was listed (maybe still am, havent used discord for a while) as one of the people to ask about it. im not officially affiliated with [dreamily.ai](https://dreamily.ai), but i do know enough about it.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-06-25-235255","1656193975","None","False","0","idqho9w","False","t3_vkmjqo","False","t1_idqho9w","False","t1_idqe5y9","/r/AIDungeon/comments/vkmjqo/if_you_want_an_alternative/idqho9w/","1656867222","28","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

Pal, I've been poor. I've had health problems. I've had to take time off work because of them. I've lived on a fixed income, or on no income, for periods of time.

I was a broke and unemployed college student once upon a time.

I was the kid who wore ugly thrift store clothes to school because it was necessary, not because it was trendy. I had a family member who worked as a school janitor and we ended up getting ""new clothes"" at the end of the school year because we'd pick through clothes kids left behind in their lockers.

So don't start judging me as 'ignorant' or 'removed' based on a few sentences on Reddit.

I know there are hardships in life. **$3/week** is not one of them, for the vast majority of people. It's just a question of how much of a priority an AID subscription is.

You literally said I was ignorant.

$3/week, $4/week is not worth arguing about.

Find me the poor working parents with starving kids who live on food stamps or rice and beans, and their only joy in life is AID and now they can't do that because of the incredibly terrible ad system. Or just drop it.

Look, on the off chance you aren't just seeing me as some bogeyman to yell at online, I'll tell you why I brought up budgeting.

Because no one learns it, it isn't taught in schools, and it's really fucking important. It changed my life. I want everyone to learn how to budget. Seriously. Financial stress is horrible and I'd like people to know how to lessen it or get out of it completely.

(I'm dealing with this right now, actually. I want my character to have a platonic friend and the game keeps having me say how much I love her and that we should start dating and yada yada.. .so there's a lot of rewriting and retrying.)

(3) Oddly, games where my character ends up becoming a god and learning the secrets of the universe. And it happens really quickly too. Like you're walking down the street and then you meet a god and they're offer to make you a god and that's the end of the story.

And if I go along with 1 or 2, it also jumps into really dark territory very easily. Like I'm fine with some of that content at a certain level, but the AI is really quick to jump to 1000 and doesn't seem to know how to tone it down.

The thing that usually happens when I play, is I try to play nice, but I get so many nonsensical things where My character, and the character that I'm talking to either want to kill or fuck each other, so I usually end up saying ""Fuck it"" and just power tripping and seeing how far I can get before either the game ends or I get bored, I.E the god thing.  
It can be nice, as well as a solid tool for getting better at writing/phrasing things, because the better the stuff you put into it, the better you can (SOMETIMES) get out of it.  


I had a fun Dream Scenario where I refused to use the story option, like doorways can lead to other dimensions/realities and things are constantly shifting, death leading to being essentially respawned and that was pretty fun, worked a bit with the memory, as well as the suggested themes things under that.

Yeah I think I've noticed that too, now that you mention it. Like my character was assaulted by some people who were definitely human, but the game was starting to describe them as though they weren't, saying they had glowing red eyes, and one person suddenly had fangs.

I just undid that and kept going.

I can absolutely see where it might have been trained on something with stories like that. Like extreme violence/sex stories with vampires, demons, horny gods, and lots of creatures with tails and wings.

I wouldn't be surprised if there were also people writing stories where they think the extreme violence has to be perpetrated by a literal monster.

To be honest, a really toned-down version of **that** is the sort of thing I might have thought was cool when I was a teenager, you know it's just boring when it's two humans, it's not scary enough, that sort of thinking. So I can easily see how some sort of amateur fiction archive would have a load of stories like that written by edgy teens.

I'm pretty new to it and I'm still in that phase where I'm hooked on those moments.

It's a whole new kind of experience, it's incredible.

It's just, as you say, a lot of work sometimes to get it to that point. But I don't mind it, it's usually worth it.

So, story time:

The first story I played through, I didn't know what to do so I had my character ""wait 3 million years"" to see what would happen. And she died. And then she was the only person left in this barren wasteland of a world (because AID doesn't seem to always know that people should stay dead). And then she ends up on the edge of a cliff, and ends up seeing a tunnel of light.

And at that point I'm thinking 'okay now the game's put me in the afterlife this is AWESOME'.

Only it was a weird surreal experience and ended with someone telling me I needed to possess a person's body and kill them.

And I said ""screw you"" and found a way out of whereever I was and went on my way.

And a bunch of scenes later I'm walking into a hotel, and I get dragged into this ""VIP room"" where some guy named Milton says he was waiting for me.

And suddenly the game tells me I'm in the body of another character (Iris) and it tells me to kill her and it writes that I slit her throat.

So as far as I can make out, the game actually made that ""possess person and kill them"" plot happen. I dunno how that works, or if it's the craziest of coincidences, but I was stunned. And immediately hooked.

Like if that's the sort of thing that can happen when it works right?

Bran was very helpful with that. What you're seeing is a side effect of a bug being fixed. It was one of my least favorite bugs because it made testing things in AID obnoxious.

So before, if there were anything too conclusive in the text, like END or THE END, the model would almost always generate a special token, &lt;|endoftext|&gt;. It would sometimes happen at random too. But with the way latitude was generating, an endoftext would actually cut off generation, and so if the model generated something that caused it, it would usually cut off generation right there, and then if you tried to continue, consistently give you an error message that said ""The AI returned an empty output.""

They fixed that so that instead of endoftext cutting off the generation, it just shouldn't be generated now. But that means that if you get something generated like END that suggests the end of a story, the model might try to generate postamble content like what you're seeing there, which is likely to include author's notes, copyright notices, urls, or other similar stuff. Best thing to do is to just edit/undo/retry when you see that happen and get rid of it.

~~If you see it happening a lot, you could try a ban on END and see if that helps.~~ AID bans are case insensitive so you can't do this, nevermind.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-06-26-210734","1656270454","None","False","0","idu7dqu","False","t3_vjf5qt","False","t1_idu7dqu","True","t3_vjf5qt","/r/AIDungeon/comments/vjf5qt/my_stories_keep_getting_interrupted_with_a/idu7dqu/","1656864163","2","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

Latitude didn't tell us, the hacker did. Which means anybody at the company, or with hacking skills, could have read private stories at any time. Whether or not anyone other than this hacker did nobody knows.

They claim to have fixed this.

But beyond that, they knew OpenAi was reading the stories and tried to sweep it under the rug. Even if we assume they had no idea it was happening until after the user base found out, the user base found out and it was being posted in almost every other post here on the reddit and frequently in the discord. And they still kept silent and tried to sweep it under the rug for months. At that point you can't say they didn't know, because we knew and we were not quiet about it. Choosing to keep silent on it for such a long time is lying by omission. (Not to mention they also went silent on the hacker too)

Additionally there was rumor that people outside of openai and latitude were being hired to go through stories manually to check for rulebreaking content. But that one I can not confirm myself because I only heard of it and never researched it myself. So I dunno who was doing it or if it actually happened or not.


But just the fact that they knew and tried to sweep it under the rug by not addressing it for months marks them as at least accomplices to the lie IMO. If they were being honest they would have addressed it as soon as they found out and at least said something like ""yeah, we didn't know about that until now. Sorry we will look into it."" Or something.

And to remain as fair as I can, I will repeat that they claim to have fixed all of these issues and I can neither confirm nor deny if that is true or not.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-06-27-160656","1656338816","None","False","0","idxim1s","False","t3_vljsey","False","t1_idxim1s","False","t1_idx335t","/r/AIDungeon/comments/vljsey/is_aid_safe/idxim1s/","1656861418","8","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

Daggerfall isn't only broken out of the box (many of the quests were left unfinished, items and weapons dont work the intended way, etc.) but the controls are ancient. You have to press the page up, page down keys to look up and down, for example. To make it playable, you'd need to download the community fixes and figure out how to set them up.

Today we encrypt your data at rest and do not read unpublished player stories without permission. We only read unpublished adventures when given permission by a player either when they ask for support or when they submit AI feedback and opt into us seeing their data.

No text AI app has full end-to-end encryption since the data has to be decrypted to be fed to the model.

When we were working with OpenAI there were issues with privacy. A past employee along with OpenAI pushed for the manual moderation of unpublished stories. When I joined the company we put an end to that. OpenAI has also shared player data with a 3rd party labeling service. Once discovered, we weren't able to fully disclose this as early as we would have liked because of agreements and legal issues inhibiting us from disclosing without their consent.

As the head of product I'm committed to make sure player data is safe. While I wasn't here during the OpenAI fiasco I have spent a lot of time in coordination with leadership cleaning things up and ensuring we don't make those mistakes again.

Now they use other models developed by AI21. While Griffin is mostly the same, Dragon has... decayed. Badly.

To start with, OpenAI added some serious restrictions how they wanted GPT-3 to be used, and Latitude tried to appease them at first with a flawed filter back in April of 2021, banning people left and right for nebulous reasons. The community fell apart while Latitude kept complete radio silence for months. 

There was also a data leak that was exposed around the same time, which led to the discovery that Latitude's servers store every single story ever made and never truly delete anything, even if you were to delete your account (something a lot of people did in outrage and protest.)

The problems really begin with those last two examples and what is clearly truly awful user-generated text input. This is what Latitude is seeking to prevent.

That's good to know. Honestly, I like trying to redirect it cause it's kind of an interesting challenge, but good to know that's probably futile.

It's funny I find it easier to break it out of porn loops than to redirect it from urging me to commit murder.

Maybe I can more creative with foiling whatever it proposes, though.

Lol. Thank you, I appreciate the good wishes.

It can be fun to do some wrangling every now and then.  


That's the beauty of it, if you try and get creative with it, it can be very rewarding and or amusing in its own right.  
About the knife, that's fair, it can be fun to go along with the craziness every once in a while. Though without input it can get far to fixated on things, sometimes if it can be fun to just hit enter or continue to see where the AI takes you, it's even more fun if you've outlined some things in the memory.

The 2nd two options both work, if you wish to reinforce 1st person go with the first option of ""I pick up the apple and eat it."" If you're not first person then you should go with the second option, ""You reach down and pick up the apple, looking at its shiny red reflection before you take a bite out of it.""

It is adaptable per session and likes familiar patterns, reinforce whatever you feel you would like to see more of, and if the AI gets stuck on a pattern, trying writing for a bit longer than you otherwise would to set forth a new pattern in order to make things right again, I've suggested this in the past and while I don't remember the users name, they said it worked and allowed them to regain control of their narrative.

Short answer: AI is expensive. Supporting the free experience on AI Dungeon costs us around $500,000 USD a year. Ads are a proven model for sustaining free experiences.

If you haven't tried the new approach to watching ads to save up actions, you should turn on beta and give that a go.

Looking through metrics this morning I found a player using this work around to store up almost 30,000 actions already. And they used this trick over and over. Around 250 other players who have collectively stored up hundreds of dollars worth of actions. 

Needless to say, we are already going to close this loop hole. The no-ad-fill is meant to not punish players who occasionally don't get an ad while in the middle of play so we aren't stopping an active player with this occasional error.

It has something akin to World Info with Limit of 200 characters for you to describe the world and a wiki for characters and additional info - where you can set relationships between the characters for the ai to memorize AND utilise how their interactions will go + the option to set their status to deceased in case if they died in your story.

Besides of that, I do not think that there is anything else that would be free. For paid options there is Holo AI, however I do not have much experience with it as I have not tested it out myself.
