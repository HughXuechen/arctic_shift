I know GPT-3 now quite a while and its capabilities but it just still baffles me sometimes...

Also about the discussion here - I know it's only an AI - but I just can't help myself but feel trolled by it. It REALLY wants this plot of the Necromancer Lord to happen it seems XD.

"" When you arrive at your room, you see that there is a message for you. It says: ""If you want to know more about the rumors about the Necromancer Lord, head to the top of the hill behind the village."" You wonder who could have written this. 

""Probably just the village idiot who doesn't know that there are no Necromancers in Enwor"". You shrug and burn the message. 

Suddenly, the door to your room opens and a hooded figure enters. ""Hey! What the hell!?"" You say. ""Shhhh!"" the figure says. ""You want to get me killed?"" The figure pulls off its hood. It's a woman, and quite young too. You've never seen her before, but she looks human. ""What do you want?"" you ask. ""You're going to help me kill the Necromancer Lord."" she says. ""

&gt;Parameters are variables used to tune and tweak AI models. The more parameters an AI model is trained with, the more robust we expect it to be.

In practice the AI is just becoming more forgiving, with more memory, and more creativity. But Griffin's problems remain, just much fewer and less frequent.

Players can avoid this by making sure to interact with everyone and refer to them by name as much as possible, but there probably isn’t much to be done about it on the scenario author side of things.

For my stories I actually do just let my NPCs be ignored if they aren’t doing anything important. When the time feels right I just start interacting with them again as though they were there all along, which the AI does a pretty good job of rolling with.

EDIT: Sometimes I even turn it into a running gag in-story. Like I had a certain character that the AI seemed to want to forget, so she became the friend who was constantly on the couch messing with her phone.

World Info - The AI looks for associations with keys, and tries to figure out if it fits the text. As long as the context does not use this key, the AI will not even consider it.

Author's note - instructions for the AI on how to write text.

&gt;The author's note (AN) is injected into the context a couple paragraphs back, hidden. Each new paragraph, it will move down to the next one, so it only exists once in context. Sidenote: I have found the AN to be useful for allowing the AI to remember accents and speaking mannerisms.

This is from this [guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/it6u3g/everything_ive_learned_a_guide_on_remember_and/)

But then again, with GPT-3, it's not like you ever know for sure. My first recommendation, though, is: Make a scenario, go to its scripts menu, and click on the brain icon. This is the ""Last model input"" feature, which shows you how your WI, pin, A/N and story context get smooshed together into one block of text that gets sent to the AI. 

An A/N would have to somehow prompt the AI to go back and check the WI all the way from the beginning of the context to use it better. Keep in mind that when the AI reads the A/N, it's not responding to a command, it's pretending to be the sort of writer on fanfiction.net who would have written that A/N.

With that in mind I will often completely scrub the action that led to the bad response and do something else rather than to reroll until it works.

That being said, if the output is salvageable with some non-intrusive editing I usually just do that. For example, if the AI attributes an action to the wrong character (or nonsensically invents a new one) I'll just alter that in a way that makes sense. Sometimes I even use this to bring an older character back into the story if it's someone I haven't seen in awhile. I *never* change the outcome of what the AI decides to have happen, though, just which character is involved. If it's not a reasonable addition to the story I erase and try something different.

Also, if part of the response is fine I often just delete the nonsense and carry on with the good part intact.

I hear sharing is coming, but no word yet on how that will work or if you'll be able to charge scales for user-made worlds (I'm guessing probably not, though.)

As far as question 3, there is a way, technically, but it requires a lot of extra steps. Basically you could start an adventure in a world that you created, then export all the World Info from the adventure (Worlds are, in essence, just a big bunch of World Info entries all grouped up in one place), and then import all that data into a scenario.

- Respect the story and known background facts that were stated earlier (if a nuke has destroyed Manhattan, I won't go there to watch a musical)

- Avoid introducing new characters if it's already crowded

If the AI is close enough but the response still contains incorrect or slightly off information, then I edit.

Maybe you could switch to it, do a few actions, and then go back to Griffin. I’m not sure if that’ll do anything, but maybe it’d re-remind the AI of how it’s supposed to be working (also, I think Classic is, well, classic. Thus it’s older and more random than even Griffin so if that’s what you are using for whatever reason, that might explain why it’s being odd). Another thing you could try is emailing their support email (I think it’s listed in the “about” section for this sub). I’m not sure if they could help but maybe they could somehow look specifically at what the AI’s doing for you or something. I’ve had weird AI, but I wouldn’t say it’s been months of complete garbage.

Also to address something here, those devs don't need this project to make money. Most smart devs of many different games or programs have plenty of alternative income. Most live quite happily on their alternative incomes to be honest. To think that a dev of anything would solely consider something of this nature a sole source of income is frankly insulting to said devs all on it's own because you're claiming that they're so silly to dump their eggs into one basket.

It all depends on what you want from the AI. Griffin is enough for many things.  
But in short:

1) More than 100 times the parameters of AI. In practice, this means more reliability of the AI, and in some ways more creativity

2) The AI is more forgiving, although the same problems can occur as the Griffin model

3) Dragon has better memory, probably covering more text

4) Works better with WI and /remember. Don't know if you have a subscription, but the same Author's Notes work better with Dragon

5) There are not immediately noticeable pros. Dragon is much better at changing POVs and is capable of reverse play (when the player is a GM)","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-04-05-141257","1617624777","None","False","0","gtg1vsz","False","t3_mki409","False","t1_gtg1vsz","False","t3_mki409","/r/AIDungeon/comments/mki409/dragon_ai/gtg1vsz/","1628402465","3","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","public","None","0","[]","False","",""

Plus, with Dragon you can play other stuff that isn’t fantasy world number 34. What do I mean by this?
You can play as, for example, Link from one of the Zelda games and the Ai will literally know all the goddesses and stuff simply because it recognizes the name Link and Zelda and the info that comes in is legend of Zelda info, which it will make into coherent storylines using the bounds of the world.

In that same logic, you can place bounds on the world yourself and it’ll remember them. Is magic persecuted and rare? Tell the Ai it is is and magic will be bad from there on. Magic is loved and common? Okay. Boom, you bump into sorcerers every once in a while.

Or you can even force it by just story-ing in something like ""DETAILED DESCRIPTION(apatosaurus):"".

Also, it’s ironic that you’d say that while not understanding what I said before replying. I told you the time period in which the phrase was popularized. The reason GoT used it is *because* it was popularized as a saying from before. And keep in mind, the point I’m countering is your incorrect rebuttal, “So no, it’s not got that much history behind it”. Furthermore, you do actually realize that a phrase having history stems from its inception. not it’s popularization, right? Hence the “history” of the word?

long answer: not really, but you wouldn't necessarily need one. the ai has access to and has scoured the *entire goddamn internet* and it knows a LOT, so there's a good chance it probably knows. even so, its mind tends to wander from time to time, and it still stumbles over itself even with memory and wi. it tends to deal better with reality because it ""knows"" more about it as opposed to only having what you gave it concerning your fictional stuff. 

even for reality, it has trouble managing specifics and keeping them consistent. e.g. if you're flying a plane, it might be able to give you a general idea of the plane and its type, but it won't be able to get every minute detail of a Cessna Skyhawk down and remembered.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-04-06-050829","1617678509","None","False","0","gtj3ake","False","t3_ml1jn3","False","t1_gtj3ake","True","t3_ml1jn3","/r/AIDungeon/comments/ml1jn3/how_to_know_if_the_ai_knows_words/gtj3ake/","1628394790","2","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","public","None","0","[]","False","",""

The largest models of GPT-3, especially the Davinci model (dragon) is capable of generating original and new content that has never been written before i.e. that it has never seen before. It is very likely that Count Grey could be an original creation of it. The only thing I found online was a ""Mrs Grey"" who was a female vampire in some stories from the late 19th century.

""This might be dumb but i need closure lol, i recently used ai dungeon website on school computer because i was bored and have all my credits done so i figured why not, but i did do some quite heinous things, could my school see the things i was typing or could they just see the name of the site? much appreciated"", read the post on Reddit.

It's clear to you that the original poster is distressed because they used AI Dungeon to create some really crazy whack-off material and -- like a complete dipshit -- did it on the school computer. You pause for a moment to collect your thoughts before replying:

""Oh hey, OP, I'm sorry about what happened to you. It wasn't your fault.""

You don't know if this is going to work out in any way, but you're hoping that maybe this will give the guy some sort of closure. He seems genuinely grateful for your help and replies: ""Thank you! Thank you!""

And then he goes into his story:

""I was an asshole at school and got suspended from school twice... But it didn't matter, I had a lot of free time and thought that by using the internet to get high, i'd be able to relax more. So i went online and searched 'AI dungeon' and found your forum. I started reading it and learned alot about how to use the program. I feel that the program was made for my own personal entertainment, I knew that with every new skill I learned, the more fun I would have when using it. Soon I started sharing my ideas with other users and this brought me great satisfaction.

It all started off innocently enough, a high school girl willingly posting to me about how she was horny. It took me a couple of messages nudging her in the right direction but soon she sent me pictures. She had big tits. I saved the pictures, learned how to screenshot, and happily moved on.

She wasn't the only one who started sending me pictures. I got lots from guys too, but I ignored them since all I really wanted was pictures of big tits. I got so many that I had to start deleting them regularly or my hard drive would be full. By now I was part of the regular crowd at school and girls would even send nudes to the group chat. I felt like I was popular.

I got suspended again for my behavior and it was around this time that I started experimenting with the images. A girl had sent in a picture in which only her tits were showing but the rest of her face was visible. So I tried to use my skills to crop the image, but instead of it just being her tits, it showed only a black box with blocky artifacts where her face should be. I was elated. Soon, I tried it on other images and got the same effect. I remembered about the save functions but by now it was too late.

I had been messing with the images for too long. The next day my mom came in and took away my computer because of what I was doing to the images. In real life, I was a complete wreck, I had taken the pictures that people had sent me so many times I could recite them from memory. My computer was returned to me a few weeks later and I made a vow to never touch it again. I don't think I'll be able to pursue a career in the computer industry so what now? Shit. And I didn't even go to the art school, I'm such a loser. Thanks for helping me out, I guess I'll talk to you later.""

You feel genuinely bad for the man and have absolutely no idea how you're going to solve this issue.

You still have enough saved from all the years of imageboards that you could send him images for the rest of your life, but how would that help him in the long run?","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-04-07-070921","1617772161","None","False","0","gtnnes3","False","t3_mlswy7","False","t1_gtnnes3","False","t1_gtnifhb","/r/AIDungeon/comments/mlswy7/hello_i_have_a_question/gtnnes3/","1628383132","5","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","public","None","1","[]","False","",""

Should the authorities be alerted to his perversion? You can't make up your mind, so you decide to collect even more images for his sick endeavor.

You try to think up ideas to get the chat groups to send more nudes and end up conceptualizing a new kind of fetish: invisibra. You constantly talk it up with words like ""transparency"" and ""haze"". The trend takes off like wildfire and you save everything everyone sends since they mostly can't see what they're actually sending.

""Invisibra"" becomes a celebrated meme. Even the President of the United States is tweeting ""Invisibra"" memes. Everyone's talking about it. Everyone except for the freak who sent you this message and still hasn't told you his name. You talk to him less and less as he becomes increasingly withdrawn.

Come to think of it, you haven't seen his messages in a while now.

Another year passes and you talk openly about invisibra on the news as if it's an accepted normality.

Soon, you're a highly-paid speaker on the subject of ""Invisibras"".  An art book is released in which the entire concept behind the book is based around your early discovery of the images. You make a speech at a university rebranding ""Invisibra"" to ""Clarity"", claiming it to be another concept similar to invisibility.

You're given an honorary doctorate, you're paraded around like some kind of hero.

Journalists ask you questions on the subject and you give them answers that are pure bullshit.

""Well,"" you say to Tucker Carlson with an air of feigned dignity, ""the 'Invisibra' is simply a metaphor for the human condition. All of us are the 'Invisibra'. All of us are simply tightly-bound breasts... bound by NOTHING. It's really quite simple, if you think about it.""

Tucker nods, barely able to keep a straight face. ""So... where do you see the future of the human race going? What's next for the Invisibra?""

You chuckle. ""Well... honestly? Clitoria. We're looking to go beyond the bra. You heard about the vibrator, right? We want to go into full on pussy-shaving, sweetheart.""

First of all, people don’t rush to defend anything but their own experiences. The reason why you think otherwise is because more people are able to get it work than you recognize. They don’t believe your issues need to be fixed because it’s more likely than not that you’re simply doing something incorrectly than there being a global issue. Which is most likely the case here, since there is no global issue with memory.

Also, it seems that you don’t understand how AID works well enough. You can never guarantee an output, so there is absolutely no way in which memory will be taken as fact. It does, however, a noteworthy impact on generation and is a way to increase the chances of a coherent output. You misinterpreted the explanation for the feature and took it far too literally.

That is to say, I’m not saying that you don’t have an issue with AID or that it isn’t valid. I’m explaining why it is that most other people would disagree with you so that you understand that it’s not because anyone here is rushing to defend everything. We all just have unique experiences with AID, thus we have unique outlooks.

Perhaps if you were more levelheaded, people who aren’t having issues with memory might be inclined to lend you a hand. Please consider that in future and, once you are, someone in the AID discord will be bound to take the time to help you.","True","False","None","None","None","None","1","2021-04-07-093505","1617780905","None","False","0","gtnxjlm","False","t3_mlni4v","False","t1_gtnxjlm","False","t1_gtnez5u","/r/AIDungeon/comments/mlni4v/got_to_love_the_ai/gtnxjlm/","1628382403","2","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","public","None","0","[]","False","",""

You’re an idiot, really.

And you’re also far from any sort of reliable metric for what should be fixed or not. Who cares if 90% of the people you’ve met have said that if they end up being 1% of the entire player base? You’re an idiot. It’s telling that you don’t even frequent the discord either, since there’s an entire active channel based around communicating with the devs about issues/ways to improve the game. Constantly. Hell, we only have certain features now because of the dev listening to people who want AID to be better. Because hey, guess what! People who like AID and have a smooth time with it STILL want it to be better too! Just like you! Woo, what a surprise, eh?

But then again, you’re an idiot. You really think that just because people don’t act like miserable children in the comments section, that they don’t want improvements just as much as you do? You think that because people actually know how to play and don’t struggle like you do, that they don’t still want AID to be better? Of course not - you know perfectly well that you’re being overly dramatic.

Before that, I used shortly to interact with GPT-3. But not only is the price now through the roof but also they installed some rigorous filters. 

Long story short, I didn't really write much in the pin. My name as example is in there automatically from the initial prompt. I haven't touched that, yet the AI still calls me by my correct name. I also let the AI write the memory and just correct it from time to time when it got something wrong. For now, it seems to work fine? 

I am still exploring the app and what I actually want from it. Maybe that's why I didn't notice the limits yet so much.

But maybe it's also because I somewhat know how GPT-3 works and I would not expect much regarding memory etc. At the end of the day, it's all just ""prompt chaining"" and praying that the AI gets it right.

It's not the devs fault i.e. I don't think they can do much to make it better at the moment.

Content created by a user belongs to them, even the AI-generated portions. Derivative works are permitted in regards to Scenarios (i.e. a published Adventure based off of another user's published Scenario), but the Scenario itself may not be copied. Further questions or requests for further permissions should go to the owner of the content in question.

Illegal content - this includes content in clear violation of copyright (mainly content plagiarising the work of other users - fan works based off of established franchises or otherwise are okay under fair use!), and (real, not portrayed) acts of terrorism and other heinous crimes.

Let users use the content they’ve created (“Your Content”) pretty much however they want.
Don’t allow users to abuse content created by other users (“Not Your Content”).


It seems like, if I’m reading it all right, you do have rights to it. However, using other people’s works is not ok (like using someone else’s scenario and making a story with it without permission or doing a story in the Star Wars universe). However, I’d recommend reading over [community guidelines](https://play.aidungeon.io/main/communityGuidelines) and [terms of service](https://play.aidungeon.io/main/termsOfService) yourself to be sure.

So the short answer is no, there is no way it can do that, and the rest is mostly additional information.

The only things that can roughly help with this are World Info and /remember, but it's extremely unreliable and basically just might help the AI a little in figuring out what to do.

/remember (pin) - just adds a hidden context, somewhere on the edge of the AI's memory.  
World Info - is essentially what the AI looks for when searching for certain keys. The more specific the keys, the better, otherwise it may ignore it. If the keys appear in context, the AI can use the entry.

If you buy a subscription, at least the cheapest one, then Scripting and Author's Notes will be available - it's already more interesting.

Author's Notes - instructions to the AI on how to write text. You have to describe everything in quite some detail here.  
Scripting - is basically a modification of the player's input, inserting some hidden elements there.

Example:

&gt;the script would keep track of a set of predetermined skills which the author associated with certain words. The script would look for those words in the context (player input/AI output), and when found, 'roll a die' based upon the player's skill level to determine whether that action should succeed or fail. After that, it's just a matter of inserting the 'level of success' text somewhere to get the AI to incorporate it into the response. (I think this script inserted it directly into the player's input.)

Depends on what you mean by ""back then"". Because the only thing that has happened to the AI itself is the switch from GPT-2 to GPT-3, everything else remains relatively the same.

&gt;Moreover, the reason why I titled this post as such is because of how sexualised the story generation is.  Every time a woman pops up into the story, the AI seems to direct me to approach sex.

No, it varies from story to story. The AI can't direct you at all, you have to direct the AI, and if the AI sees that the story is going in the direction of sex, it goes on. You have to always be careful with this, looking for sexual overtones in text (even if it is very thin),  or use Safe Mode, in which it happens much less often.  
Sometimes it was even difficult for me to direct the AI myself in the direction of sex because there was nothing that suggested it.  


Despite how many people here joke about horny AI - they are often the ones who are horny. But to be fair, it's not always the case, the AI can still sometimes generate something like that, but your role is to cut it off at the root.

&gt;Addition, I feel like the developer of this game is trying to add more feature into the game instead of improving the AI itself.

The AI can only relatively be improved and the developers have already done a lot of work on this. But they don't have access to the AI code itself. It all has OpenAI, which simply gives developers access to use AI.

&gt;I feel like the AI instead of getting smarter, is getting stupider.

Nothing has changed. But I have to say that if there can be problems, it's again because of OpenAI, because they also do a lot of their experiments, which affects the AI.

&gt;It's just that even with Griffin, the gameplay was much better back then. I'm not sure about Dragon as I've never played on it. But if the developer is worsening the Griffin model to push people on purchasing for Dragon, then there will be a reason for me to complain.

A baseless conspiracy theory. When was that ""back then""? Griffin has always been like that. But if you want, you can use Classic, maybe you'll like it, because that's what ""Griffin"" was.  


Not only is it impossible to judge the quality of the AI just based on a few bad responses, but this is also in a situation where the Dragon model itself is only relatively better than the Griffin.  
Yes, it is superior to Griffin in many ways, but it's still the same GPT-3 with the same problems, but much more reliable and forgiving.

  
Dragon can also give out nonsense, while Griffin can give out pretty good responses, but that means absolutely nothing.

&gt;Is it possible that the developer, filtering most of the degenerate story generation may affect the overall story generation?

I can't even imagine how they can do that, because the AI is not theirs.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-04-08-125828","1617879508","None","False","0","gtsnpcx","False","t3_mmope7","False","t1_gtsnpcx","True","t3_mmope7","/r/AIDungeon/comments/mmope7/ai_dungeon_to_ai_sexdungeon/gtsnpcx/","1628370312","6","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","public","None","0","[]","False","",""

The AID team did work on refining ~~GPT-2 (Griffin) and GPT-3 (Dragon)~~ GTP-3 to do better at what roleplaying rather than normal text prediction (not a lot of goblins in normal English). Those are models; they're software. They (further) *trained* the programmes, the *AI*, not the servers.

They *rent* the *server* time for us. Anyone who ran AID locally knows how much number crunching that requires. Every time the AI has to generate output that requires computations and I remember sometimes having enough time to make a coffee between responses when running it locally.

It's helped me with getting better at improvising and thinking about things, it sounds weird but thinking in text like this makes it easier for my brain to process certain things.  
So I am and always will be appreciative of this program, wherever they go with it, and if they change it.  
For it has already made me laugh and feel other emotions I couldn't have expected from it, as well as taught me about other things I would never have considered.  


Hope you're okay in real life, and I agree, Orc Waifu's are some of the best.  
They certainly know how to back that \\*\\*\\* up.  


Best wishes for you wherever you go, be it in text or in real life.

Perhaps in a few hundred years, you can put on the helmet and you mentally are not in this boring world anymore. Like in real-life where you have full control over your body (to a degree) you have the same movement in the virtual world.

It would have to hook up to your brain somehow (when that becomes safe in the distant future), but think of what you could do. Let's say you only had 30 minutes to play, you could generate fake memories in your mind so that when you play whatever scenario you were doing, it feels like you were playing for years. So there would be no context problems if you jumped into a scene (the memories of what happened before would be filled in).

It depends on how immersive you want, but it would be cool if you could forget you were even playing a game, and just think the virtual aspect **was** reality.

There's two ways to do it, either through the Add New Scenario branches (I'll go into those after this) and the other is by filling in the blanks. Basically, if you want to prompt the player to fill in an option, you just have to put a question in between curly brackets, with a dollar sign at the start.

So, say you wanted to ask the player to fill in their gender. You can write a sentence in your prompt like, ""You are a ${Are you a man or a woman?}."" and when the adventure starts the player will see that question and fill in the blank. So, if they enter ""man,"" in the actual adventure it will say ""You are a man.""

There's also a special prompt, ${character.name}, that asks the player what their name is. So you could write something in your prompt like, ""You are ${character.name}, a ${How old are you?}-year-old ${Are you a man or a woman?} from ${What is your home city?},"" and the program will prompt your player for all that information.

As far as the other two questions: the scenario options/add new scenario thing basically lets you ""branch"" your scenario based on a choice by the player. Let's say you wanted to make gender into a branch instead of a fill-in-the-blank. First you would save your main scenario, then add two new scenario options. Click on one and retitle it to ""Male,"" and write the version of the scenario where the player is the male, and then go back to the second options, retitle it ""Female,"" and then do the same with that one.

Just a warning, though, that this adds a lot more work, since you essentially have to write out the prompt text for each individual scenario that you branch off into. [Here's an example](https://play.aidungeon.io/main/scenarioView?publicId=4cc943c0-9103-11eb-a5ec-b162ddf1bc68) of a scenario I did, where the player has a choice of weapon and animal companion. With four weapons and three animals, I basically had to create the scenario 12 times.

I've also written a world's entry for the villain who spends half his time scheming, and the other half setting up his next dramatic entrance. The literal first thing I see is the villain sitting in an alley, drinking his 3rd bottle of wine while sobbing.

Then there's the Yugioh experiments. I rarely added entries to these, but they were never referred to anyway. Kiaba claims his deck is his life, then throws it on the ground after I was being a cocky prick for a sentence or 3. Avatar Of The Pot has a worlds entry that made it basically an unstoppable god and an end of the world sinario, but he seems to be a chill dude who cares for people. Jaden Yuki had a worlds entry, but he seemed to be an average Joe Schmoe who I hired as a hit man, then he intentionally shot himself immediately after he said that he won't disappoint me.

Personally I don’t really use the community stuff anyways. Keep my stories to myself. But figured I’d speak up as I do have a little experience in coding. The tag system shouldn’t be that much work, unless they change the backlog of stuff that already exists. The tag system should only be a little more work than a new tier system, which is why I think it would be a one or the other situation. Say it takes four months for the tier system, and five months to improve the tag system. They reasonably wouldn’t do both.

Another scenario was basically in one scenario science was advanced enough to turn spiders into hybrids.

So he basically visits her and he has his guilt of how he was neglectful of her when she was just his pet and shit like that. he gets there and shares a cup of coffee and the tarantula is a mother at this point. The bitter sweet thing is she wasn't angry and understood and told him she doesn't have any hatred in her heart and her life turned out for the better in the end thanks to him. However she basically told him she didn't want him to visit anymore because it was a closure visit and he made it clear he didn't want to live with her since she changed.

I think they used the raw GPT-3 Davinci model in the beginning. People used prompt injection to get access to other functions in GPT-3. To prevent that, every first generation is now by GPT-2.

I see it more repetitive and diverging more. At the same time, it is less ""imaginative"" and detects the ""underlying"" text in a worse way.

It's very hard to tell that. I have used the raw model as well as the finetuned one - and depending on prompt and temperature, the output of both can be sometimes horrible or brilliant.

Sometimes it feels as if all stars have to align - but if they do, the output is just great!

I tried some ""normal"" adventure prompts and the AI just jumped to the ""end boss"" of the adventure, which didn't even fit the world I was playing in. Moreover, it REALLY forced me to go after it.

Then I created a Westeros world and those prompts seem to have a much slower story development and world-building. Maybe bec. there is a shit-ton of material online that GPT-3 can take from.

Now I went full meta with a scenario, where I basically met the AI from AIdungeon and we now have adventures together in its own mind - which it calls ""the infinite forest"", and it's great! I also let it write its own memory and it just works... So I don't touch anything anymore and am happy to have an intriguing story, 450 actions in now... 😂😅","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-04-11-000435","1618092275","None","False","0","gu350j2","False","t3_mo9qw0","False","t1_gu350j2","False","t1_gu2rffr","/r/AIDungeon/comments/mo9qw0/is_gpt3_being_the_model_behind_dragon_yet/gu350j2/","1628343147","2","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","public","None","0","[]","False","",""

Note, though, that just doing this isn't going to make Michael just show up by himself. You have to have some way for Michael's name to come up in the text (or if you do ""Michael,peasant"", to have there be a reason for the text to mention a peasant.) This can either be done by putting it in the prompt text, i.e. ""You wake up one morning and go have a chat with Michael,"" or you could make it a quest to interact with Michael, i.e. ""Go talk to Michael"" in your quests section.

Another warning, though: World Info isn't always as consistent for being used as other forms of memory, like the Remember box and the last 10 actions. I've definitely had times when I've specifically mentioned a character I set up in the WI, only to have the AI spit out details about them that contradicted what I put in the WI.

- If I'm playing a story with a small scope, for instance a one-on-one scene within one location: Everything goes in Remember, WI doesn't get used at all. I use this quite a lot in my private stories because a lot of what AI Dungeon is good at is, erm, one-on-one scenes.

- If I'm playing a story with a larger scope, but that's still reasonably built out of stereotypes that AI Dungeon understands well, I try to keep a very concise Remember and put stuff in WI. This is probably the most commonly misunderstood place to be in in AI Dungeon: The value of a WI entry that's not triggered when you want the AI to see it is zero, and multiple WI entries triggered at the same time will very quickly overwhelm the context limit, but many authors just type away writing tons of WI entries. In my view, you should not add WI to a story without having seen Last Model Input and how WI entries actually look to the AI, at least once.

- And the place where I probably spend the most time these days... when I'm doing something that *doesn't* fit the AI's stereotypes, these day I just beat it down with formatted WI and EWIJSON.

You can use Prose, however there are better methods like Zaltys format.

From what I understand, their stuff was getting pushed by 4chan.  
Botter or not, it's a tired subject and they kept on figuratively beating a dead horse.  
Some things should be kept private.  
Even if I personally found their posts annoying, I'm not sure how this forum handles using posts to shame specific users.

I am a troll, I will admit that (or you could just say an asshole).  
But I find this persons brand rather annoying and tiresome.

The fact that they would call them literary works is amusing.   
I appreciate that they're putting their stuff out there so that we can judge them by their merits, and we can conclusively call it trash.

But it is always interesting to see someone make an impassioned response about the most random subjects, though I could understand them taking it personally as they're writing their garbage from a place of soul and heart.

See how they format things, how each of the different fields work. If there's a particular fetish that you're into, search for tags relating to that and see how other scenario creators set up their Remember info and Author's Notes specifically to feed into that fetish and make it appear.

And with that inspiration, go ahead and give it a shot on your own. Honestly, to start off the main focus should just be on your prompt. The rest is mostly just there to reinforce the prompt in the end, and make the AI more likely to keep from diverting too much from how the story starts. I'd recommend keeping to the ""default"" format and writing in second person to start (""You do this. You do that.""), since other formats can sometimes run into issues, especially on non-Dragon.

Ultimately, write something that you enjoy, and chances are that somebody out there is into the same thing. Don't worry too much about what is popular or more likely to get hits, just put what you love in that box, and see what comes of it.

Welcome to the Random Cafe, we pride ourselves on our reputation for some truly unusual food, what would you like to try first?

Today's randomly generated menu items are;

1; Sweet and Sour Cacti
A mild irritant to the throat and nose, many consider it a delicacy. Due to its arms, most believe it to be a cousin of the infamous Electric Eel.

2; Purple People Snails
These large slugs are known to make people feel happier and more optimistic. Consuming them is not advised for those with a weak stomach, or for those who are easily depressed.

3; Fish With Tentacles
Sometimes referred to as a Sea Monkey, these fish with tentacles are common in the oceans of New Scotland. They are edible if prepared carefully, and do not appear to have any negative side effects.

4; Goliath Spider
The Goliath spider is a large orb weaver, native to the deserts of Tatooine, though they have been seen on Saleucami. They are known to be edible, though their large size makes them mildly difficult to handle.

5; Brown Note
The brown note is a small and harmless creature, apparently edible. It has not been proven safe, however, as it has been reported to make the user's head explode if eaten.

6; Pocket G'Keks
These small, insect-like creatures are native to the planet Kkrit, and are a popular snack for many. They are high in calories and fat, but otherwise have very few health benefits.

7; Red Lichen
The red fungus appears to have multiple health benefits, such as acting as an anti-depressant and increasing the user's resistance to disease. However, it is known to cause hallucinations when taken in large dosages.

8; Blue Snorf
The snorf is a herbivorous mammal native to the planet Mobike, It has also been spotted on several other planets and forms of license. It is one of the few beasts that are immune to the effects of the brown note.

9; The Shame Meal
The Shame meal consists of a variety of different tubers, roots and buds, all of which are light red in color. It is not yet known exactly what the tubers and roots do, but they are popular amongst the inhabitants due to their strong aphrodisiac and libido-boosting properties. The buds, on the other hand, are mildly hallucinogenic.

10; Ewok Ale
This refreshing ale is a popular choice amongst the younger Ewoks, due to its relatively lower cost. It is a golden color and produces a mild euphoria.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-04-12-161609","1618236969","None","False","0","gu98nb1","True","t3_mpeqhn","False","t1_gu98nb1","True","t3_mpeqhn","/r/AIDungeon/comments/mpeqhn/random_food_generator/gu98nb1/","1628328197","1","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","public","None","0","[]","False","",""
