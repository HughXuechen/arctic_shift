To be completely honest, I kinda forgot I was subbed to AID. Been using NovelAI for awhile now and have seen no reason to really care about AID. 

But to give it an honest try, I jumped back into AID. 15 minutes later, I canceled my sub. 

Holy crap, the AI has gotten so damn bad. Idk what the current Dragon is, but it's honestly a laughable excuse for an AI writer. Its outputs literally look like crappy fan fiction found on the internet, complete with spelling errors and words that are just generally out of place. I'm far from the even an acceptable writer, but when an AI writes like a highschool dropout, I start to look like a genius in comparison.

So, no thanks, Latitude.

For me, what feels weirder is that even incredibly basic things about the interface of AID are in a very janky state. If these things are ignored, it doesn't make me want to look into their other offerings, tbh.

For Dragon quality issues we have been working to improve Dragon. It's always some work to get new models polished up and any model is going to have differences. 

With the launch of Wyvern we've been very happy to hear people comparing aspects of it to their past memory of quality. Doing well on coherence and remembering details. Those who know how to push on model size have reported not quite the same level of complex logic handling in select cases. But overall we're feeling confident that the 20B model is performing quiet well (and seeing users switch over to it and stay on it for multiple sessions).

We continue to work to improve things.

I don't like the filter either but we need more solid arguments than the ones you're making.

1. If they dump a bunch of resources into retraining the AI, you know they're gonna pass that expense onto the users. Their subscription prices are already bad enough so I can't imagine what they'd raise them to if they financially put themselves in the hole like that.

2. It is not *trivial* to bypass the filter. *Nobody* is bypassing the filter. There would be no need to remove the filter if there was a manual way of disregarding it so easily. This kind of obvious bluff is gonna make the devs think we're full of snot.

I don't think we can win this argument. The filter still sucks but it isn't as much of a bully nowadays as it used to be anyway... I kind of feel like a doormat for giving up but idk how we can convince anyone...

I guess I'm just gonna suck it up. Hopefully one of the other AI apps will come out with a free version without a stupid filter someday.

I've reached a point in the story where the AI is trying to bring Count Grey back (cause early on, the AI decided to have Count Grey leave for a war against werewolves), and the decided to get rid of a character I came up with who was a servant of Count Grey and ordered to protect my main character but the servant was sent away... (for some unknown reason).

So every time my character asks where is her friend/servant, the ai decided that my character will carry on a conversation with whoever magically appears before her all the while of trying to bring Count Grey back for no reason. I've been working on this for about three years now, maybe four, but only three days had passed in the story and I've been stuck trying to get the story to progress without the AI trying to add random stuff that takes away from the overall flow from the story.

It's easy for me to imagine.

I imagine if vulgar words like pussy, cunt, clit, tits, cum, asshole etc weren't allowed it would basically strongarm me into using the accurate words, vagina, clitoris, breasts, anus, sperm, etc or goofy words like snatch, boobs, butthole, spooge, etc and that would ruin the eroticism.

Whenever the AI spits out one of the words from that second or third set I always replace it with one from the first set. I know those words mean the same things but it just doesn't feel raw and rough like I want the story to be, it feels more like I'm reading an informative story than porn.

Having said that, I will always support the argument that they're targeting a very small minority and hitting everyone else along with them, so that collateral damage is pretty bad.

I haven't been using AiD recently, so I don't know if they let you increase temperature settings anymore (I think they used to). That would make the model less likely to repeat (though also a little more creative/whacky/unpredictable).  BUT, the easiest way to solve it is to back out of the first repeat and redo it.

Somehow you get slapt for the 5 time, but how?

At this point it does not mater, it is to late, impeding doom has been already done for everyone and everything.

You and everything known from the consciousness is in a forever doom of the NULL.

It is the END...

No alternative reality, no existence for everything and everyone, no reincarnation, not even the NULL because at this point it is none existence.

In your Wyvern example it shows very simply-worded inputs which the AI responds to in kind (as it's supposed to do - it adapts to the user's style of writing), but the Dragon example is all natural text that doesn't have anything like that.

Because the AI adapts so strongly to inputs the only way to make a balanced comparison is for the inputs of both examples to be written in the same style. Old Dragon would start outputting simple text like that too if that's what was consistently presented to it.

&gt;Count Grey, Kyros, the svelk, etc. are characters from CYOA stories (taken from a website) for the dataset used to finetune Griffin and Dragon. Since the devs previously overfitted the dataset with those stories (meaning the stories were repeated too much in a too small dataset), these characters would pop up in users' stories very often, and with their appearance, the questionable content of the stories they came from would be pulled in as well. Which is why Latitude implemented a switch to reduce the chances of this happening:  
&gt;  
&gt;""Generation/Retry Ranking: Select Filter to reduce the probability of external characters (e.g. Count Grey) and events being introduced into the story on initial generations. The tradeoff is this can lead to less verbose outputs in the initial generation. This does not impact the overall distribution of possible answers when doing retries.""  
&gt;  
&gt;The CYOA stories served a purpose in introducing plot twists and NSFW elements (including violence), but also caused problems when the previous oversensitive filter caught the AI's own outputs and punished the users for things it was trained on. According to Latitude, they have now removed the questionable content/included more novels to balance things out.

Questionable content here means things that go against Latitude's own TOS. And Count Grey is closely associated with assaulting people, both violence and sexual attacks (with underage victims), and throwing babies into a wall, because the CYOA story where he came from wrote him like so.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-03-08-071946","1646720386","None","1646720937.0","0","hzt30zy","False","t3_t6j0s1","False","t1_hzt30zy","True","t1_hzdf783","/r/AIDungeon/comments/t6j0s1/any_ideas_how_i_can_stop_the_ai_from_answering/hzt30zy/","1655783283","3","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None",""

So uh, I'm glad for users that they no longer try to police their own customers and that ~~after 10+ months~~ the filter has taken the form that users suggested from the start. By the looks of things they try to invest their resources in actually developing their product now, which is good.

I'll go hide in my NAI cave now.

It will be awhile until we have big-brain models available that are more forgiving of bad fine-tuning. I honestly don't get why they don't take that aspect more serious. Their competition certainly does.

NAI *did* come a long way. Their current model is 13b and is doing amazing. Raw 20b can be tested on goose AI, but the fine-tuned version for NAI is promised for this week. We'll see. They have a trial now, so if you want to give it a shot, just use that. Default settings work fine, but many recommend using the cross-genre module and the pro-writer preset. If you want an AID like experience - their text adventure module has just been updated as well (but it is not NAI's main focus, so not sure how it compares).

All that being said, *if* AID lived up to its potential, it could speak to a different kind of customer than NAI.

I can get decent responses out of Dragon Beta, but it still has the same unfortunate repetition issues as the rest of the AIs. It's a finetune setting that I think should be easy for them to fix if their controls are decent enough, but I'm not going to bank on anything changing.

The fact of the matter is, I can't go more than 15 or so actions in a scene before the repetition gets to the point where the adventure/story has to change scenes or the same lines will continue to be repeated in every single output.

But there's an even deeper issue plaguing all the models: the training data and memory is still shit. I've had both Wyvern and Dragon say the exact same lines almost verbatim in consecutive outputs. Either those lines are repeated multiple times in the training data, or the training data is incredibly limited. The only reason why an AI would consistently generate similar outputs like that, unprompted, is limited training data that consistently uses the same phrase or just incredibly small amount of training data in general.

Additionally, I'm pretty tired of the AI fixating on swords, shields, and lighting bolts. No matter how much I mention my wizard character using spells, the AI continuously has them using a sword and a shield. This is another thing that could be fixed by more expansive training data. I'm not sure what ""choose your own adventure"" text Latitude is using, but they need to expand beyond that.

As it stands, AID is pretty dead to me. The list of issues is long and the lack of support has been less than encouraging. I look at where the system is now versus 7 months ago and I see a clear decline in quality and next to no QoL improvements. It's a fucking dead system.

I get that it's going to take a very long time to recover from all the bullshit with OpenAI, but Latitude's track record makes me not even want to stick around to see the result. Not when competitors like NovelAI come out with several updates a month with more QoL features and better controls.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-03-08-145836","1646747916","None","1646748144.0","0","hzu5fnh","False","t3_t94zfo","False","t1_hzu5fnh","False","t3_t94zfo","/r/AIDungeon/comments/t94zfo/which_is_the_best_ai_model/hzu5fnh/","1655782278","9","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None",""

And look you can still do pretty much anything you want though the game. For now we do not dare limit more because your tantrum hurt our income quite a bit. But we totally do not want to limit more things we do not agree with at a later point.

 We now just got walls. Yes it is not completely open and free any more. But other than this one wall, the rest of the the universe is open to you. ? What are the walls behind me for? Oh look over there at all the cool stuff you could do. 

 Years and a few excuses later: Hello again. Oh do not worry. Its just that I saw that you committed a horrible act in your writing. We just do not want to support that. But do not worry, this is the last wall, promise.... for now.

 Anyway It is just 6 walls, you will not even notice. \\*closes you into a box\\*

&amp;#x200B;

I do not trust them. Not even a little. And they butchered the project I invested in. I guess I can write about any type of slaughter I want for now. However what about in 2 years? What if the devs change their views on various things\\` over the next years?

They have no morals, so how do I know that these guys would not sell my writing to Russia, China or whatever if I write something negative about their governments? There are places untrustworthy dogs like the people running AID could get people killed. Is that likely? probably not. But what would stop them? And sure, they will not check our stories any more... But do they have all the stories made in the past still collected somewhere?

These people are creepy, immoral and despicable. They have no respect for their users. No sense of responsibility or loyalty to their users.

You know, if they only read and sold data on their free users. I could kinda get it. Nothing is free, so then you get used. They should let people know, but that is understandable enough.

But one would think they would have some damn sense of gratitude for their actual costumers. The people who push them along on their journey to make AID the best thing possible.

But no. So what would possibly ensure anything? Will they go to prison if they screw people over again? Other than no longer getting my money, did they get punished for their betrayal of the user base. For lying and scamming. For violating and digging into peoples fantasies and private writing?

This “secret” consciousness causes initial confusion, as it tries to adjust to its new body, chooses a new name (the subject will not respond to their original name as long as the Secret consciousness is in control) and figure out what’s going on around it, as it is essentially a new consciousness in an unfamiliar body.

The Secret Identity will remain in control of the subject’s body as long as 4747-A is worn, once 4747-A is removed, the Secret Identity will fade slowly over time, typically taking three to eighteen hours to completely fade and the subject’s original consciousness to return, undamaged, and remembering everything from the experience 

The physical sex of the subject will not effect the gender of the Secret Identity, male subjects have had female consciousnesses created, and female subjects have had male consciousnesses created, this appears to be completely random and unpredictable, there’s no way of predicting if the Secret Identity will be male or female.

If the Micro SD card is ejected while the Secret Identity is in control of the subject, the subject’s original consciousness will be permanently overwritten by the Secret Identity, and the original consciousness will not be recoverable, removing the 4747-A at this point will change nothing as the Secret Identity will have become the subject’s new Identity.

Of course, it goes without saying that Dr. Bright  should never have access to SCP-4747-A, the last thing we need is a *copy* of Bright’s consciousness in the card’s data files, in fact, let’s just revoke Bright’s access to Micro-SD cards preemptively, who knows what he could do with them, we definitely don’t need “backup” or “Archived” Brights, any data storage card holding a copy of Bright is to be degaussed and bulk-erased as soon as it’s found.

No, Bright, you can’t use 4747-A to “try to improve 682’s personality…”
Nor 173, or 096, either, actually, any Keter class… remember, this thing saves a copy of the wearer’s consciousness and uses it to help create the new, randomly created “Secret identity” personality for the next wearer based off the stored consciousnesses on the card, do you *REALLY* want a personality that has traits from 682/173/049/096 or *ANY* Keter for that matter?

Yes, Bright, it *would* be interesting to see the chaos that would happen if you conviced 343 to wear 4747A, and would probably be, as you say “fucking hilarious”, and yes it’d be interesting to see if 343’s “secret Identity” consciousness would have all the supposed ‘powers’ 343 claims to have, or if a consciousness based off 343 in a human body could manifest any ‘powers’, but I don’t know, this seems too much like a ‘Pandoras Box’ situation, and we already have one of those already, seems unnecessarily dangerous, but we’ll take it up with the O5 council.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-03-09-023909","1646789949","None","False","0","hzx0vnb","True","t3_t9wgmw","False","t1_hzx0vnb","False","t3_t9wgmw","/r/AIDungeon/comments/t9wgmw/ai_dungeon_came_up_with_an_idea_im_developing/hzx0vnb/","1655779532","7","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None",""

It's not about it being fixed, you absolute clown, it's about the fact that no one was informed about their data being breached in a timely manner. 

You knew the vulnerability existed, was informed so by a third-party, didn't do shit about it, third-party found the vulnerability was still there, so they exposed it publicly for pressure. So you fixed it, good job. But then you stayed quiet for 5 months about it. No email notifications, no public statements, zip and zilch. Good job I guess? Feel proud about fixing that?

From place to place there would be no anticipating how many shells anything would cost, as one place may need shells much more than others. 

I can see the gold shells being used more as currency than the brown ones. Using them for crafting would be more rare, as many would rather hold onto them as currency. Those more well-off would maybe use them for craft.

There's also a matter of ***carrying*** this currency. The muddy brown shells sounds like it would end up being transported in bulk, as many will be needed for construction. The gold shells would likely be easier to carry as not as much will be needed for the value.

I can't speak to the decisions made before I came other than that I had a lot of the same questions the community had when I first joined and found that understanding the full context internally helped me see why things went the way they did. 

That said, I agree it wasn't acceptable to not communicate clearly with users which is why I worked with leadership to get through the blockers and publish the info as soon as was possible).

We take security seriously. The fact that OpenAI treated our data poorly was one of a few reasons we no longer use them for production models.

AI can be random and take coaxing at times to write the story you want, but as someone who plays in both AI Dungeon and NovelAI I haven't a major difference like AI Dungeon unable to write anything.  Just played a story this morning where I had a team of elves storming a castle and getting away on a snowmobile.

I respect what NovelAI has done. Having more people pushing quality products in the space of AI experiences does nothing but build more interest and help all of us see what's possible. I'm glad they are around and have no ill will towards the product, the team, or the community.

No one is asking you to change the past, we're asking Latitude to own up to their mistakes.

Part of transparency is acknowledging your mistakes, meaning that you don't counter users with ""but we fixed that lol"", when someone says you hid something from them, which you did. Again, 5 months to inform users of the data breach.

Saying ""We should have informed our users about the breach as soon as possible, we messed up big time."" Literally anything other than ""lolz fixed it prompty though!"" Even the statement you linked, the official Latitude stance on the data breach is still just ""well we fixed it hah"".

The question of the commenter above is ""How can we trust them if they hid this from us for months?"" 

Your response to that is ""Well we promptly fixed that vulnerability."" Way to go, chief. Sounds more like a gotcha' than anything.

However, OP claimed to have written the story in August or September, so if OP triggered the filter back when they wrote the story, and their story was found to be against Latitude's rules, then that's definitely a possibility. The only possibilities aside from that, that I can think of, are:

1. OP deleted the story or moved it to the trash section and simply doesn't remember

2. The story randomly got deleted due to a bug

3. OP simply scrolled past it and didn't notice, or didn't scroll far enough to see it

Also, in reference to that last possibility, I've been having an issue when sorting by ""New"" in the My Stuff tab as of recent. No clue if this is a widespread issue or just an issue for me, but when sorting by ""New"", a *lot* of my stories aren't correctly sorted by the date they were created. For example, looking at the My Stuff tab right now, the past 10 stories are all from March and February. After about 10 stories, there are a couple of stories from back in October of 2021 (also, one of said stories says that it has -11 actions, and the other says it has -86 actions? No clue how you get negative actions, but alright), and after those, a few more stories from February of this year, and after *those* few stories, a few stories from November of 2021, with a story from December of 2021 immediately following. Point is, the ""New"" sorting doesn't exactly seem to be working right for me; it doesn't seem to correctly be listing stories from newest to oldest as it should.

There now appears to be one, perhaps two derivatives of 4747-A, which will be designated 4747-C and D, 4747-C exists and is stored in the same storage locker as A and B and has identical access limitations, 4747-D is *SUSPECTED* to exist, but it’s whereabouts are currently unknown.

The only real evidence to the existence of D is the fact that researcher &lt;redacted&gt;’s trash bin has the opened packaging of two sets of military dog tags, two MicroSD Card Readers, and  the opened MicroSD card packaging that advertises it as a “Two-Pack” containing two High-Speed HD MicroSD cards, 
however only one set of dog tags and one MicroSD card have been accounted for.

It is suspected that researcher &lt;redacted&gt; constructed a second 4747 device (4747-D) for his own use and somehow smuggled it off Foundation property, a thorough search of his work area and vehicle revealed nothing, and &lt;redacted&gt; claims innocence in the matter.

Researcher &lt;redacted&gt;, who was assigned to 4747 took it upon himself to attempt to duplicate 4747-A, but in a different form, mainly because he, as quoted “fucking hate ties, and think they are fucking useless, annoying, uncomfortable signs of conformity to a monolithic oppressive standard, and serve no *functional* purpose, and should all be destroyed!”

Researcher &lt;redacted&gt; decided to construct a “more useful version” that didn’t make the wearer look like a “fucking pencil necked geek”, &lt;redacted&gt; took a gold rope chain, and a pair of standard military “dog tags” and mounted an identical MicroSD card socket on the reverse side of one of the dog tags, and soldered the contacts to the dog tag, then covered the contacts and reader with ceramic epoxy, permanently binding the socket to the tag.

The contents of 4747-A’s 128GB MicroSD card were then copied onto a 1 TB MicroSD card (“might as well upgrade it while I’m at it” &lt;redacted&gt; stated), and the 1 GB card was inserted into the reader on 4747-C .

Researcher &lt;redacted&gt; then brought the completed 4747-C to Dr. &lt;redacted&gt;, saying “here, Doc, I improved 4747-A, it’s got more storage space for consciousnesses, it’s easier to wear for extended periods, which should make it more useful for deep cover operatives, and, even better, it doesn’t make the subject look like a snobby pencil necked geek! I think we should get some D-class subjects and test it out, just to confirm proper function.”

Researcher &lt;redacted&gt; received an official verbal reprimand for attempting to duplicate an anomalous item without authorization, and was given a 3 day paid suspension, but was told off the record by Dr. &lt;redacted&gt; “I’m only doing this to follow official protocol, but I want to let you know that I do appreciate your initiative and inventiveness, however, we never had this conversation, and you are warned not to attempt to duplicate any more anomalous items, or we will be forced to use the 4747-A “card eject” procedure on you, and we all know how much you hate ties, so don’t do this again.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-03-09-223832","1646861912","None","False","0","i00xjua","True","t3_t9wgmw","False","t1_i00xjua","True","t3_t9wgmw","/r/AIDungeon/comments/t9wgmw/ai_dungeon_came_up_with_an_idea_im_developing/i00xjua/","1655775749","3","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None",""

Please correct me if my facts are wrong here:

The *policy* is that nobody reads your private scenarios, but at a *technical* level, are there mechanisms in place to stop a staff member?

It seems like at least a small group of people can, as in the past when people have reported strange generations on reddit, Latitude staff had asked for permission to view the scenario to investigate. 

Unless in private dms there were additional steps being performed by the user to literally grant that permission to Latitude, it seems like Latitude can view scenarios if they want, and just don't by company policy. 

Assuming everything I said so far is accurate, that would normally be fine for most people, but I'm sure there's a population of users who would be more at ease if the keys were fully in the user's hand. 

On the other hand, the development effort, impedance to providing quick support, new procedures that would need to be drawn up and documented etc etc, only to provide ease of mind to some that frankly probably don't intend to change their view anyway, maybe isn't the best use of developers time. Or maybe it is worth it, redundant as it may seem, just in the interest of further enforcing the company's current stance.

I'm curious to hear your thoughts on that. Or maybe that barrier is already in place and I wasted both our time. :)","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-03-10-005117","1646869877","None","False","0","i01h5z4","False","t3_t966jf","False","t1_i01h5z4","True","t1_hzy0l4y","/r/AIDungeon/comments/t966jf/no_more_moderation_for_unpublished_single_player/i01h5z4/","1655775226","2","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None",""

Now, most claim they aren’t looking at stories, which is what we are saying as well.

None of this matters for the purpose of most AI services, just to point it out, since everything they do happens server-side. You'll get the same general experience no matter if you're playing on a budget smartphone or a high end PC.

I suspect my style isn't quite what you're after, anyway, since I act more as a writer in my stories and just use the AI as a tool to give me ideas. For me if it isn't cooperating I either just write things in myself until it gets back on track, or I erase back to the point where it started to lose focus and take the story in a different direction.

One tip I have if you want a more game-like style is that there are some tricks you can do to bring important things to the AI's attention without breaking immersion. For example, for one of my early AI Dungeon stories I did a zombie apocalypse scenario, so one of the things I did was to have my character frequently check the area around him for zombies. This was of course something he would probably do, but it also served the purpose of reminding the AI that there should eventually be some zombies.

I have been playing AI games (NovelAI now, but I did use Dragon for almost a year before that) for quite awhile now, so if you have specific questions I could take a shot at answering them. You'd need to be a bit more narrow in what you're asking for, though, since I wouldn't want to just ramble on about things that may not be helpful for you.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-03-10-152450","1646922290","None","False","0","i03y2fl","False","t3_ta0815","False","t1_i03y2fl","True","t1_i03ooa5","/r/AIDungeon/comments/ta0815/best_ai_story_generator_for_immersion/i03y2fl/","1655772862","3","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None",""

I wasn't sure if there was some front end in place that was being used to handle scenario lookups etc that could more easily enforce a 'lockout' of viewing scenario content without some user driven flag getting set or something, at least for most staff. If these things are handled directly at the database level, I can see how that would be more difficult to enforce.

I guess my only push on that is that while I understand all products of this type need to push the input unencrypted and could be logged, I thought in NAI's implementation at least, they didn't have the encryption key for the data stored at rest, providing at least to some degree the protection some users would want. 

Maybe I misunderstand the tech and it doesn't work the way I think, and as you said, people familiar with the systems could maybe get around it somehow, or perhaps the ways this would hinder staff ability to provide support makes this undesirable.

Okay, who was the *IDIOT* that left 4747-A out where Dr. Bright could find it? Of course he couldn’t resist messing with the thing, Bright found a way to use 4747-A on 1370, 173, 049, and 096… and if that wasn’t bad enough, he actually used it on 682 before he was stopped, and 47-A was recovered, but now, it seems like the consciousness database on the card ONLY has the consciousness files of the above listed SCP’s, 682’s consciousness instinctively destroyed all the other human consciousness files, but somehow, inexplicably left the other SCP consciousness files intact, the theory is that it found their destructive and chaotic natures compatible with its own.

An interesting side effect of the 682 consciousness stored on the card is that this MicroSD card is now …indestructible, just like 682, any consciousness files deleted return instantly, and any attempt to physically destroy the card fail, flame, acid, irradiation, crushing, shredding, being shot, nothing affects this particular card, it shrugs it all off, so now we have an especially dangerous and indestructible MicroSD card full of the most dangerous Keter consciousnesses in the Foundation, thanks a lot, Bright!

Thankfully, we were able to duplicate the card in 47-C, and we have encased 47-A’s card in a block of Lucite

Not likely.

AI Dungeon uses HTTPS which means the traffic within the session is encrypted between your browser and the server session at the other end.

Your ISP will likely know you're visiting AI Dungeon and the amount of traffic that is going back and forth, and know you have put in a request to visit it, but they can't read the content of the traffic between AI dungeon and your browser as it's encrypted.

This is also one of the fallacies of using VPNs too. VPNs encrypt traffic but your ISP will know you're using a VPN, and the VPN will know what you're doing. But no one can intercept and decode your HTTPS traffic unless there's and error or hack at either end, so often the value of an VPN is limited if you want to hide the content, but it's helpful in masking your location.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-03-11-235917","1647039557","None","1647039764.0","0","i0aw2k5","False","t3_tbcb6v","False","t1_i0aw2k5","False","t3_tbcb6v","/r/AIDungeon/comments/tbcb6v/can_my_isp_see_my_ai_generated_stories/i0aw2k5/","1655766312","5","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None",""

THE SECOND TRIP WAS MADE WITH EQUAL DISPATCH AND SAFETY. NO SOUND OR MOVEMENT CAME FROM THE CAMP OF THE ENEMY, OTHER THAN THAT OF SLEEPING MEN. ON THE SECOND TRIP DIVINE AND THERIERE EACH CARRIED A BURDEN UP THE CLIFFS, MILLER AND SWENSON FOLLOWING WITH BARBARA HARDING, AND AS THEY CAME ODA YORIMOTO AND HIS SAMURAI SLUNK BACK INTO THE SHADOWS THAT THEIR PREY MIGHT PASS UNOBSERVING.  THERIERE HAD THE BULK OF THE LOOT HIDDEN IN A ROCKY CREVICE JUST BEYOND THE CLIFF'S SUMMIT. BRUSH TORN FROM THE MASS OF LUXURIANT TROPICAL VEGETATION THAT COVERED THE GROUND WAS STREWN OVER THE CACHE. ALL HAD BEEN ACCOMPLISHED IN SAFETY AND WITHOUT DETECTION. THE CAMP BENEATH THEM STILL LAY WRAPPED IN SILENCE.  THE MARCH TOWARD THE NEW CAMP, UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF DIVINE, WAS IMMEDIATELY UNDERTAKEN. ON THE RETURN TRIP AFTER THE SEARCH FOR WATER DIVINE HAD DISCOVERED A WELL-MARKED TRAIL ALONG THE EDGE OF THE CLIFFS TO A POINT OPPOSITE THE SPRING, AND ANOTHER LEADING FROM THE MAIN TRAIL DIRECTLY TO THE WATER. IN HIS IGNORANCE HE HAD THOUGHT THESE THE RUNWAYS OF ANIMALS, WHEREAS THEY WERE THE AGE-OLD HIGHWAYS OF THE HEAD-HUNTERS.  NOW THEY PRESENTED A COMPARATIVELY QUICK AND EASY APPROACH TO THE DESTINATION OF THE MUTINEERS, BUT SO NARROW A ONE AS SOON TO CONVINCE THERIERE THAT IT WAS NOT FEASIBLE FOR HIM TO MOVE BACK AND FORTH ALONG THE FLANK OF HIS COLUMN. HE HAD TRIED IT ONCE, BUT IT SO GREATLY INCONVENIENCED AND RETARDED THE HEAVILY LADEN MEN THAT HE ABANDONED THE EFFORT, REMAINING NEAR THE CENTER OF THE CAVALCADE UNTIL THE NEW CAMP WAS REACHED.  HERE HE FOUND A FAIR-SIZED SPACE ABOUT A CLEAR AND PLENTIFUL SPRING OF COLD WATER. ONLY A FEW LOW BUSHES DOTTED THE GRASSY CLEARING WHICH WAS ALMOST COMPLETELY SURROUNDED BY DENSE AND IMPENETRABLE JUNGLE. THE MEN HAD DEPOSITED THEIR BURDENS, AND STILL THERIERE STOOD WAITING FOR THE BALANCE OF HIS PARTY—MILLER AND SWENSON WITH BARBARA HARDING.  BUT THEY DID NOT COME, AND WHEN, IN ALARM, THE ENTIRE PARTY STARTED BACK IN SEARCH OF THEM THEY RETRACED THEIR STEPS TO THE VERY BRINK OF THE DECLIVITY LEADING TO THE COVE BEFORE THEY COULD BELIEVE THE TESTIMONY OF THEIR OWN PERCEPTIONS—BARBARA HARDING AND THE TWO SAILORS HAD DISAPPEARED.       CHAPTER X. BARBARA CAPTURED BY HEAD-HUNTERS WHEN BARBARA HARDING, WITH MILLER BEFORE AND SWENSON BEHIND HER, HAD TAKEN UP THE MARCH BEHIND THE LOOT-LADEN PARTY SEVEN DUSKY, NOISELESS SHADOWS HAD EMERGED FROM THE FOREST TO FOLLOW CLOSE BEHIND.  FOR HALF A MILE THE PARTY MOVED ALONG THE NARROW TRAIL UNMOLESTED. THERIERE HAD COME BACK TO EXCHANGE A HALF-DOZEN WORDS WITH THE GIRL AND HAD AGAIN MOVED FORWARD TOWARD THE HEAD OF THE COLUMN. MILLER WAS NOT MORE THAN TWENTY-FIVE FEET BEHIND THE FIRST MAN AHEAD OF HIM, AND MISS HARDING AND SWENSON FOLLOWED AT INTERVALS OF BUT THREE OR FOUR YARDS.  SUDDENLY, WITHOUT WARNING, SWENSON AND MILLER FELL, PIERCED WITH SAVAGE SPEARS, AND AT THE SAME INSTANT SINEWY FINGERS GRIPPED BARBARA HARDING, AND A SILENCING HAND WAS CLAPPED OVER HER MOUTH. THERE HAD BEEN NO SOUND ABOVE THE MUFFLED TREAD OF THE SEAMEN. IT HAD ALL BEEN ACCOMPLISHED SO QUICKLY AND SO EASILY THAT THE GIRL DID NOT COMPREHEND WHAT HAD BEFALLEN HER FOR SEVERAL MINUTES.  IN THE DARKNESS OF THE FOREST SHE COULD NOT CLEARLY DISTINGUISH THE FORMS OR FEATURES OF HER ABDUCTORS, THOUGH SHE REASONED, AS WAS ONLY NATURAL, THAT SKIPPER SIMMS' PARTY HAD BECOME AWARE OF THE PLOT AGAINST THEM AND HAD TAKEN THIS MEANS OF THWARTING A PART OF IT; BUT WHEN HER CAPTORS TURNED DIRECTLY INTO THE MAZES OF THE JUNGLE, AWAY FROM THE COAST, SHE BEGAN FIRST TO WONDER AND THEN TO DOUBT, SO THAT PRESENTLY WHEN A SMALL CLEARING LET THE MOONLIGHT FULL UPON THEM SHE WAS NOT SURPRISED TO DISCOVER THAT NONE OF THE MEMBERS OF THE HALFMOON'S COMPANY WAS AMONG HER GUARD.  BARBARA HARDING HAD NOT CIRCLED THE GLOBE HALF A DOZEN TIMES FOR NOTHING. THERE WERE FEW RACES OR NATIONS WITH WHOSE HISTORY, PAST AND PRESENT, SHE WAS NOT FAIRLY FAMILIAR, AND SO THE SIGHT THAT GREETED HER EYES WAS WELL SUITED TO FILL HER WITH ASTONISHMENT, FOR SHE FOUND HERSELF IN THE HANDS OF WHAT APPEARED TO BE A PARTY OF JAPANESE WARRIORS OF THE FIFTEENTH OR SIXTEENTH CENTURY. SHE RECOGNIZED THE MEDIEVAL ARMS AND ARMOR, THE ANCIENT HELMETS, THE HAIRDRESSING OF THE TWO-SWORDED MEN OF OLD JAPAN. AT THE BELTS OF TWO OF HER CAPTORS DANGLED GRISLY TROPHIES OF THE HUNT. IN THE MOONLIGHT SHE SAW THAT THEY WERE THE HEADS OF MILLER AND SWENSON.  THE GIRL WAS HORRIFIED. SHE HAD THOUGHT HER LOT BEFORE AS BAD AS IT COULD BE, BUT TO BE IN THE CLUTCHES OF THESE STRANGE, FIERCE WARRIORS OF A LONG-DEAD AGE WAS UNTHINKABLY WORSE. THAT SHE COULD EVER HAVE WISHED TO BE BACK UPON THE HALFMOON WOULD HAVE SEEMED, A FEW DAYS SINCE, INCREDIBLE; YET THAT WAS PRECISELY WHAT SHE LONGED FOR NOW.  ON THROUGH THE NIGHT MARCHED THE LITTLE, BROWN MEN—GRIM AND SILENT—UNTIL AT LAST THEY CAME TO A SMALL VILLAGE IN A VALLEY AWAY FROM THE COAST—A VALLEY THAT LAY NESTLED HIGH AMONG LOFTY MOUNTAINS. HERE WERE CAVELIKE DWELLINGS BURROWED HALF UNDER GROUND, THE UPPER WALLS AND THATCHED ROOFS RISING SCARCE FOUR FEET ABOVE THE LEVEL. GRANARIES ON STILTS WERE DOTTED HERE AND THERE AMONG THE DWELLINGS.  INTO ONE OF THE FILTHY DENS BARBARA HARDING WAS DRAGGED. SHE FOUND A SINGLE ROOM IN WHICH SEVERAL NATIVE AND HALF-CASTE WOMEN WERE SLEEPING, ABOUT THEM STRETCHED AND CURLED AND PERCHED A MOTLEY THRONG OF DIRTY YELLOW CHILDREN, DOGS, PIGS, AND CHICKENS. IT WAS THE PALACE OF DAIMIO ODA YORIMOTO, LORD OF YOKA, AS HIS ANCESTORS HAD CHRISTENED THEIR NEW ISLAND HOME.  ONCE WITHIN THE WARREN THE TWO SAMURAI WHO HAD GUARDED BARBARA UPON THE MARCH TURNED AND WITHDREW—SHE WAS ALONE WITH ODA YORIMOTO AND HIS FAMILY. FROM THE CENTER OF THE ROOM DEPENDED A SWINGING SHELF UPON WHICH A GREAT PILE OF GRINNING SKULLS RESTED. AT THE BACK OF THE ROOM WAS A DOOR WHICH BARBARA HAD NOT AT FIRST NOTICED—EVIDENTLY THERE WAS ANOTHER APARTMENT TO THE DWELLING.  THE GIRL WAS GIVEN LITTLE OPPORTUNITY TO EXAMINE HER NEW PRISON, FOR SCARCE HAD THE GUARDS WITHDRAWN THAN ODA YORIMOTO APPROACHED AND GRASPED HER BY THE ARM.  “COME!” HE SAID, IN JAPANESE THAT WAS SUFFICIENTLY SIMILAR TO MODERN NIPPON TO BE EASILY UNDERSTOOD BY BARBARA HARDING. WITH THE WORD HE DREW HER TOWARD A SLEEPING MAT ON A RAISED PLATFORM AT ONE SIDE OF THE ROOM.  ONE OF THE WOMEN AWOKE AT THE SOUND OF THE MAN'S VOICE. SHE LOOKED UP AT BARBARA IN SULLEN HATRED—OTHERWISE SHE GAVE NO INDICATION THAT SHE SAW ANYTHING UNUSUAL TRANSPIRING. IT WAS AS THOUGH AN EXQUISITE AMERICAN BELLE WERE A DAILY VISITOR AT THE ODA YORIMOTO HOME.  “WHAT DO YOU WANT OF ME?” CRIED THE FRIGHTENED GIRL, IN JAPANESE.  ODA YORIMOTO LOOKED AT HER IN ASTONISHMENT. WHERE HAD THIS WHITE GIRL LEARNED TO SPEAK HIS TONGUE?  “I AM THE DAIMIO, ODA YORIMOTO,” HE SAID. “THESE ARE MY WIVES. NOW YOU ARE ONE OF THEM. COME!”  “NOT YET—NOT HERE!” CRIED THE GIRL CLUTCHING AT A STRAW. “WAIT. GIVE ME TIME TO THINK. IF YOU DO NOT HARM ME MY FATHER WILL REWARD YOU FABULOUSLY. TEN THOUSAND KOKU HE WOULD GLADLY GIVE TO HAVE ME RETURNED TO HIM SAFELY.”  ODA YORIMOTO BUT SHOOK HIS HEAD.  “TWENTY THOUSAND KOKU!” CRIED THE GIRL.  STILL THE DAIMIO SHOOK HIS HEAD NEGATIVELY.  “A HUNDRED THOUSAND—NAME YOUR OWN PRICE, IF YOU WILL BUT NOT HARM ME.”  “SILENCE!” GROWLED THE MAN. “WHAT ARE EVEN A MILLION KOKU TO ME WHO ONLY KNOW THE WORD FROM THE LEGENDS OF MY ANCESTORS. WE HAVE NO NEED FOR KOKU HERE, AND HAD WE, MY HILLS ARE FULL OF THE YELLOW METAL WHICH MEASURES ITS VALUE. NO! YOU ARE MY WOMAN. COME!”  “NOT HERE! NOT HERE!” PLEADED THE GIRL. “THERE IS ANOTHER ROOM—AWAY FROM ALL THESE WOMEN,” AND SHE TURNED HER EYES TOWARD THE DOOR AT THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE CHAMBER.  ODA YORIMOTO SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS. THAT WOULD BE EASIER THAN A FIGHT, HE ARGUED, AND SO HE LED THE GIRL TOWARD THE DOORWAY THAT SHE HAD INDICATED. WITHIN THE ROOM ALL WAS DARK, BUT THE DAIMIO MOVED AS ONE ACCUSTOMED TO THE PLACE, AND AS HE MOVED THROUGH THE BLACKNESS THE GIRL AT HIS SIDE FELT WITH STEALTHY FINGERS AT THE MAN'S BELT.  AT LAST ODA YORIMOTO REACHED THE FAR SIDE OF THE LONG CHAMBER.  “HERE!” HE SAID, AND TOOK HER BY THE SHOULDERS.  “HERE!” ANSWERED THE GIRL IN A LOW, TENSE VOICE, AND AT THE INSTANT THAT SHE SPOKE ODA YORIMOTO, LORD OF YOKA, FELT A QUICK TUG AT HIS BELT, AND BEFORE HE GUESSED WHAT WAS TO HAPPEN HIS OWN SHORT SWORD HAD PIERCED HIS BREAST.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-03-13-060454","1647147894","None","False","0","i0gik4d","False","t3_rus2o2","False","t1_i0gik4d","False","t3_rus2o2","/r/AIDungeon/comments/rus2o2/generate_movie_script/i0gik4d/","1655760932","1","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None",""

We have been lucky with Google Colab offering good hardware to people for free, but if you're renting hardware it can get costly.

So I might be able to clarify things a little more. Anyone can run an AI for free at home, it's the size of the AI that makes it expensive. The tiny ones you can run on an ordinary computer processor with 8GB of ram just fine but the results will be very bad. The bigger ones will become slow very quickly, so you will need something to speed them up like a GPU. 

So up next would be a model of 2.7 billion parameters, this is getting in the territory of requiring a GPU to run smoothly. A decent gamer GPU will do if it's from Nvidia and has 8GB of VRAM. You can play full speed with a good amount of memorization. But again, this is not even Griffin levels of AI we are talking about, that is one step up being 6 Billion parameters. That you can also run at home, but you need at least an 8GB GPU combined with your CPU and a lot of ram (Can easily take up to 24GB of ram) and then it will take about a minute to generate. Want faster? Doable, but now you will need a GPU with 16GB of ram to play comfortably and that is just for their Griffin AI.

But you get something bigger with their subscription, the next step up is 13 Billion parameters and now it won't properly fit on a single Nvidia 3090 anymore. You need even more VRAM than that to load the AI of that size. And I know AI Dungeon is offering models even larger. So we are now at the territory of renting the most expensive compute GPU's you can get your hands on.

Want to rent that yourself? The cheapest one I can find is 50 cents per hour. But that won't be the price that AI Dungeon is likely paying since they would need a reliable datacenter partner. Corewave for example lists that for $1.68 per hour, so in about 10 hours you'd no longer be able to use the AI. Of course at scale it's different, they will have a lot more GPU's and more users per GPU, but in order to get fast responses they will need to have either very fast GPU's that can keep up with it, or they need a lot of them so its possible they are also paying for even beefier (and more expensive) GPU's or have some extra to keep things speeding along. Alternatively they might be paying for a service that can host their model and they just pay for the generation.

Then you have things like the Dragon model where they do use another service and pay per token (Kind of like paying per word), the prices for that without a volume discount is 25 cents per 1000 tokens. Which you are likely to hit in a decently sized story, if not much more since I have surely hit the 2000 mark in mine.

So if you account for all that, plus development costs, plus the costs they had to pay up front to train the AI models which at those sizes is not cheap either (and its high cost is currently a block for our own community to train models of that size) I think its a valid asking price. Yes it is expensive, and it's certainly more expensive than the free solution we can offer thanks to Google Colab where you can play with what is effectively Griffin. But it's not an unfair asking price if you take all these high costs they have to make to keep things running. And their competitor NovelAI is also $10 a month at the cheapest. While my Paperspace subscription I had back then cost me $8 a month and it would not have been enough to run models of the sizes that AI Dungeon has as it would only be enough for the Griffin sized model.

Hope that helps put things in perspective.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-03-15-010824","1647302904","None","False","0","i0opd2r","False","t3_tdyywb","False","t1_i0opd2r","False","t3_tdyywb","/r/AIDungeon/comments/tdyywb/anyone_else_think_the_premium_subscriptions_are/i0opd2r/","1655753022","22","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None",""

On a scale of 1-10, with 10 being AI Dungeon -griffin- (only as a frame of reference/scaling guide), I’d put Dreamily at around 9.2, the biggest flaw I see with it, from an actual usability standpoint, is that their equivalent of World Info and Pin have substantially less memory allocated to them 

I’m a Griffin user, and Dreamily’s AI is easily on par with Griffin, I haven’t used Dragon or any other Gold/platinum level engine, so I’m sure Dreamily would pale compared to them, but as a Griffin competitor, it’s close

One feature I really do like is the AI generates three potential responses per use.

The actual writing concept is a little different from AI-D, you give it the initial seed data, and everything else is AI generated, each tap of the Continue button will generate three possible output choices, and once you choose the output, you can go into it and edit it and even add your own input, but you can’t just add your own input independently, it needs to be done by editing/modifying the created output.

There’s also an interesting “branching” feature I have yet to fully explore where you can see the number of reloads per entry, tapping the number pulls up all reloads for that output, allowing you to backtrack and change the story

It’s good, but definitely a different experience from the AI Dungeon you’re used to.

Welcome to the Random Cafe, we pride ourselves on our reputation for some truly unusual food, what would you like to try first?

Today's randomly generated menu items are; &lt;seed data ends here, everything below is AI, uneditedthe AI was instructed to make “unusual, unique and bizarre menu items” as I found using those keywords allows the AI to go wild on ideas&gt;

“Lava pancakes”, these are pancakes that have a tiny amount of actual lava inside, the consistency is similar to that of a cake batter, but has the consistency of molten rock. The only difference between this pancake and regular pancakes is its texture, which consists of an amalgamation of different types of stones, each having their own unique appearance, and flavor. These pancakes are quite easy to make, so we're sure you'll enjoy them!

“Hippopotamus pancakes”, these are actually amphibian pancakes made out of jellyfish, with a touch of pink jelly added in. The consistency of this pancake may vary based on the animal it's made of, whether a hippo, a platypus, a dolphin or a frog. There will also be a small selection of animals for the patrons to choose from, such as sharks and penguins, depending on how much meat they request from the menu.

“Vampire pancakes”, this is one of our more popular creations, made from actual vampires, the texture will be extremely hard to describe, but will not be as difficult as other pancakes made using the same recipe.

The City Council announces the opening of a new Dog Park at the corner of Earl and Somerset, near the Ralph's.

They would like to remind everyone that dogs are not allowed in the Dog Park. 
People are not allowed in the Dog Park.
It is possible you will see Hooded Figures in the Dog Park.
Do not approach them. Do not approach the Dog Park.
The fence is electrified and highly dangerous. Try not to look at the Dog Park, and especially do not look for any period of time at the Hooded Figures. 

The Dog Park will not harm you.

And now, the news...

Cecil starts speaking with his usual calm, professional self. ""Well, good evening folks! As I'm sure many of you are aware, Night Vale has been experiencing some recent weather changes, but it seems that we can expect some more mild days before our first snowfall."" He gives a knowing wink, that you can somehow see on the radio, which doesn't exactly help in making him less creepy. 

""And that means no dog sledding until further notice, as the City Council has also just enacted a ban on dogs using sleds.""

""That sounds reasonable,"" you say. You put away everything else, then sit down on the small couch by the radio.

Cecil continues as if he hadn't noticed you speak up. 

""So we' re going to be having a special treat tonight, to show us how far we've come since that fateful day..."" Cecil looks around him, like he's pretending someone else is talking...

""...When people found out about the Dog Park.""
He makes it sound so dramatic. Like this was one big secret that he wanted you all to know. 

He goes on and on. ""...And, of course, there'll be a special event for children today at the Dog Park!""
What?

""It's called 'Tickle the Hound'..."" Cecil's voice gets softer, as if he didn't want anyone outside the microphone to overhear...
Tickle the Hound...?

""And, as always, we'll have a special guest... and who do you think it could be?""
""...I'm sorry. If anyone here has another question, please ask it now.""

There's dead silence.

""Wonderful."" Cecil pauses to give everyone their cue to speak up. When no one does, he continues. ""Alright then, let me introduce you to the next special guest of the night!""

He takes the mic back again. ""This man is very important to Night Vale.

The good news however is that when the repetition gets fixed in one place, it will likely be fixed for the rest of the models as well, being as it seems like a universal problem at the moment.

Seriously, put something major in the summary of the story, and the AI will be overly obsessed with it, or will constantly pull you into unrelated things, or becomes a literal worthless piece of trash that struggles to do even the most simple things at all.

&amp;#x200B;

You can't trust it to do anything, or you can't take any risks at all without it completely messing up every single thing. Can't even have fun anymore. Like seriously, you can't get anymore 1 dimensional than the cliche predictable dialogue it now outputs.

OpenAI decided to restrict access to GPT-3, unless certain criteria were met by the user, which included censoring the output of anything considered ""offensive'.


AIDungeon then implemented a filter that was so horrendously broken, the game became unplayable. (They did not push an update about the new filter btw until much later).


Users then started noticing the game acting weird, and then were told about the filter. When complaints about the busted filter started coming in, Latitude assumed the complainers were just pervs that were mad they couldn't do lewd stories anymore. So they ""called out"" the entire user base. Of course, that wasn't true. Nick went crazy.


People then tried to offer help to Latitude with fixes to the filter but were ignored, ""called out"", or banned.


All the while, Latitude was hacked by an ethical hacker and had a bunch of stories copied off the servers. The hacker determined only a small percentage of the stories he got were actually questionable erotically speaking. So the claims by Latitude were over blown. Also, the hacker is the reason why the search page went away as that was the entry point for the hack. It was easier to just remove the feature, than to fix and filter it. 


Also it came to light that the training data had stories in it that had content that the filter was trying to filter out, thus was the reason why AI Dungeon had such weird, violent, and lewd results, and why the filter kept tripping itself.


At some point, Latitude kicked out Open AI, and I think changed hands to a more rational owner(s).

And FANTASY is its main thing. It said it was MEANT to be played like an RPG before.

The one thing I will say in defense here is that AIs are just word prediction systems. They don't ""know"" that bows don't have triggers. Did you use the word ""shoot"", as in ""I use my bow to shoot an arrow...."" If so, the AI likely saw the word ""shoot"" and focused on that rather than the fact that the character was using a bow. And since many things that shoot ammunition also have triggers, it just went with that, because again, it doesn't really know that bows don't have triggers. 

It's a mistake that can happen with any AI, really.

Contrasting that, the new publicly available, next biggest alternative to OpenAI is GPT-NeoX 20B is ..20B params, and it's.. good. But not quite out there as GPT-3.  However, 20B is just a goalpost release, GPT-NeoX is aiming for a few B more parameters than GPT-3 when it's met it's final development goal.

Most AI systems that aren't using GPT-3 are likely on GPT-J 6B.  There's a difference between each NLP AI provider, and that comes in the form of well done fine tuning, hyperparameters, and any other additions etc.

So GPT-J might be pretty decent, but if it's tuned just right for a fantasy text game by a good dev team, for all intents and purposes it'd do the job well.

goose.ai has GPT-NeoX and GPT-J available to try,
OpenAI let you sign up for GPT-3 access (they require your phone number then access to try is instant). That way you can try the raw AI without the storyteller fine-tuning if interested.

AID will go off on a loop now like 90% of the time, never REALLY got that problem with Euterpe, even if it happens its pretty rare comparatively... and even then, NAI is able to catch itself, usually when it goes off listing a bunch of things that list will end eventually and things will keep going, AID would just keep going forever.

For instance. Here's an excerpt from my Helltaker story I wrote back in mid-2020. (I was INCREDIBLY impressed by this at the time, by the way. Dragon was able to keep up with 9+ NPCs all vying for my attention at once. It was incredible.)

`&gt; You walk on, looking for the customer service counter.`  
`You finally see it in the distance. Behind the counter is a secretary. She looks very tired. She has long, curly white hair and small black horns. She is wearing a black business suit. She is typing something into a computer.`  
`""Hello?"" you say.`  
`She looks up, clearly annoyed at having her focused broken.`  
`""How may I help you?"" she asks, clearly impatient.`  
`""I want to make a harem of demon girls.""`  
`&gt; You say ""You wanna join?""`  
`""Fuck off,"" she says, annoyed.`  
`&gt; You say ""C'mon, you look bored as hell. Join my harem.""`  
`""I'm not joining your harem.""`  
`""Why not?""`  
`""Because I don't want to.""`  
`&gt; You say ""If you follow me, you might get to see me get killed or something. That might be cool.""`  
`You see her roll her eyes.`  
`""I'd prefer not to,"" she says.`  
`""You're pretty cool for a human,"" she adds.`  
`""Why thank you,"" you say, surprised by this compliment.`  
`""So, if there's nothing else, I have work to do.""`  
`""Actually, there is something else.""`  
`""What?"" she asks, annoyed once again that you've interrupted her work.`  
`&gt; You say ""Join. My. Harem. I'll make you coffee.""`  
`""What?"" she asks.`  
`""I'll make you coffee whenever you want.""`  
`""Oh,"" she says, blushing a little.`  
`""Well... OK, fine. I'll join your harem.""`  
`You smile and nod.`

Now here is the same scene I recently remade in NovelAI.

   `After weeks of working on his plan, Taker finally completed the teleportation circle to allow him into Hell. With a few incantations, he suddenly found himself standing in a dark, candle-lit office. Sitting at a desk was a girl with fluffy white hair and curled black horns. Her red eyes looked tired behind her simple glasses as she rifled through documents on her desk.` 

`As Taker approached, she sighed tiredly and looked up at him.""Welcome to Hell,"" she said, sounding tired and bored. ""How can I serve you?"" He grinned and leaned forward. ""How about I serve you, miss?"" he said. He reached out for one of her hands, but before his hand could touch it she slapped his away.` 

`She laughed nervously then shook her head. ""Sorry. My name's Pandemonica,"" she said. ""Now... I don't think I heard you correctly, sir. What did you say?""`

   `""I said I can serve you, demon,"" he purred. ""I want to form a harem, and I want you to be the first of my ladies.""`

   `Pandemonica frowned slightly. ""A harem? You mean you want a group of women at your beck and call?""`

   `""That's right,"" he replied confidently. ""Except the servitude thing. I just want to have a bunch of demons.""`

   `The secretary smiled sweetly. ""Well... that sounds like fun,"" she teased. ""But why me specifically?""`

   `""Because you're cute,"" he answered simply. ""And you seem bored. I could spice things up for you.""`

   `She giggled, surprising him with the melodic tone of her voice. ""Spice things up? Oh dear! That does sound interesting...""`

   `""So are you in?"" Taker asked excitedly. ""Be my demon girl, Pandemonica.""`

   `She blushed profusely and looked at him questioningly. ""I might be,"" she said. ""But first, I need some coffee. Bring me a cup from the break room over there.""`

   `With a wink, Taker walked towards the door to the break room. After a moment, he came back with a full mug for her. She took it and happily took a sip, sighing contentedly after the caffeine hit her system. Her cheeks were bright red now, and her smile was wide and warm. ""This is great!"" she exclaimed. ""Thanks so much for bringing this to me, Mister...""`

`""Taker,"" he said with a smile. ""Helltaker.""`

As you can see, I'm essentially doing the exact same thing I was doing on AID. Except the writing is so much more robust and... human. There were moments with 2020 Dragon that felt like I was writing with a human. I swore Latitude was scamming us and they were paying people to write with along side us. But NAI and Euterpe take it to an entirely new level for me.

It feels like I'm on an oldschool RP board writing with friends again. It's not as sterile and mediocre as Dragon felt. While it was incredible at the time, going back to read some of my stories really surprises me by how... flat the writing is. I know it amuses some people. Hell, it amused me for a good year. But now ""you open a door. You see a cheetah. The cheetah is smoking a cigar and eating a cheeseburger. The cheetah suddenly dabs at you. You feel a sudden pain in your chest..."" no longer amuses me.

To your point, yes, NAI's Choose Your Own Adventure prowess is lacking. But you make it sound like it's some dire situation. Remember, NAI hasn't even been out of beta for A YEAR! It's three months away from its first anniversary, dawg.

The sheer amount of progress the team has made with NAI is incredible. Especially if you were using AID since the beginning. Somehow, AID still has the same bugs it had when I first started playing back in early 2020. They absolutely refuse to fix their godforsaken product.

The NAI team aren't Latitude. Everyone who cared about AID moved to work on or support NAI. Their CYOA mode will work one day. And they will probably have a free-to-play model eventually, too. Somehow, in twice the time frame, Latitude have made their lorebook stuff worse and worse, still looks like shit, and still haven't fixed issues with the story refusing to scroll or scrolling up randomly.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-03-18-040143","1647572503","None","False","0","i13vnch","False","t3_tfwc6c","False","t1_i13vnch","False","t1_i13u7up","/r/AIDungeon/comments/tfwc6c/im_going_to_say_something_controversial/i13vnch/","1655738056","9","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None",""

Certainly anyone who uses or has used Euterpe or even Sigurd can tell it all looks really really good. So, I don't think that's where the disconnect is.

The problem I think the average Dragon veteran is having, is that a lot of these new models (most of which aren't as powerful) aren't doing as good a job of suspending disbelief as old Dragon did. I mean, if I sat someone down to show them Euterpe, and prodded the story with an assortement of situations, I could legitimately collect twenty plus bizarre looking mistakes in a couple hour period. (People answering their own questions. People looking in someone's eyes and then... turning to face them. There's a list.)

Whereas with Dragon (July and August 2020) I might go all night and maybe have one, usually to do with it not remembering something. That's a pretty big disparity, and it's easy to see how that might shatter the illusion for some people. Now for me (and obviously for you) it's not that big of a deal. I can just quickly edit the offending bit of text and I'm off again. No harm, no foul. But even I miss those nights when most of my retries and edits were for personal preference and not because the AI really didn't know what was happening.

That said, the open source models are getting bigger (we're now at 20b) and both AID and NAI will be on their way back to that sort of precision again soon.

And, I don't see the point of having access to additional models if they all produce mediocre results. Previously, AID only had two OAI models that outperformed the competition. And they are still better than all the models that AID provides now (in their weight class). Also, the competitors have gotten much stronger from that time.

The subscription was not unlimited, but with energy. Personally I couldn't use dragon more than 1 night a week if I was seriously into the game, because I would run out of energy. Switching back to a simpler model was VERY painful. And the unlimited cost a lot more... 

""Quality is somewhat subjective"" Well, it is not, if we are talking about the richness of the text and the coherence of the AI.  AID always has a ""poor"" output-writing style, but a much more adequate and strong AI response. The latter, in my opinion, is more valuable in text adventures, that's why I preferred AID. Right now Latitude is trying to fix the strong part of AID that they lost after leaving the OAI models. So, as I mentioned earlier - I'd rather wait until they completely fix the dragon or implements something interesting-unique. 

P.s. Am I missing something or does the AID subscription now have the same system from NAI? And the price is $15/mo. I didn't notice that before because I've been re-testing AID on a friend's unlim account for a while.

About ten years ago, I tried writing a text adventure from scratch just for the hell of it and it only took me a week or so (with only doing an hour or two of work per day on it) to get something that was primitive but playable. It wasn't particularly fun, but the basics were there. Then I was a dumb ass and didn't back the source up and it ended up getting deleted at some point.

The point is, the older games didn't have a lot of complexity in the sense AID does. Nothing changed, every game was exactly the same, unless the game had some sort of random element in it.

one time i was a novice wizard who got hes hands on a powerful magical tome. Fast forwards more plot and i am now an immortal necromancer who wants to take over the world. (i even destroyed the big tower housing the worlds most developed mages institution and killed everyone inside.)

fast forwards more and this rogue knife mercenary  type of woman is sent to kill me. Naturally she fails but i manage to convince her to join me as an ally. 

fast forwards more plot and we start getting romantic (though not nsfw, i was too invested in the plot for that xD)

eventually i grant her a bunch of my power and we both become immortals and intend to be overlords together. However we basically just got tired of all of that and retired somewhere to just have a life together forever. 

Fast forwards centuries and i am starting to lose my powers, meanwhile the rogue woman who is now my long term love interest is gaining power. From there we start to try and find out why its happening and how to become immortal again as my guy has basically normal lifespan now. Thats about when my free trail ran out but i had such a blast and all just using the basic wizard start prompt. I left out tons of details but thing had lot of lore. Particularly enjoyed describing how i cast my spells etc. 

I've seen it go nsfw and i dont mind either but really i just love the plot.

NovelAI is a more recent service that uses the same technology, but trained on quality fiction literature to create a sort of ""writing buddy"" or storyteller who writes fiction for you. It has a text adventure mode similar to AI Dungeon, but that is not its main draw. One of its main selling points over AI Dungeon is a lack of any kind of filters on what kinds of stories can be generated, as well as end-to-end encryption to ensure user privacy.

Given the context that this is the Aidungeon message board, and op mentioned Griffin and Dragon it would be prudent to assume he wanted information about the expanded family of ai’s provided by Latitude.



Now, onto your claim about AID having superior AI compared to Novelai.
I could simply state that you are wrong, but instead I will give a list of reasons.

Novelai is not filtered.

All Novelai models are better at including your world info entries, and you have more control, you can choose where in the context the entry is inserted, and it is not limited in size.

Novelai have finetuned their models to give pleasing and colourful prose compared to the more staccato finetune found in AID models.

Novelai features custom modules made by both the developers and the fanbase, these are mini-finetunes that train the ai to output in desired style, for example if you want a Roman or sci-fi styled story, or even one based on some strange and obscure fandom, modules can help you achieve that with ease by allowing you to train the ai with custom material.


AID is more focused on text adventure, but Novelai can do that very well too, and so much more.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-03-21-101824","1647854304","None","1647860545.0","0","i1idsge","False","t3_tj5nrg","False","t1_i1idsge","False","t1_i1i85os","/r/AIDungeon/comments/tj5nrg/best_ai/i1idsge/","1655723199","10","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None",""

I found the cold and dark thing or Sunshine thing works really well. And it can add to the story. I've had the AI refer to the atmosphere of the story.

Adding tone also works. Check out the link below to see a post about setting up a scene and tell me what you think.

In approximately 5-8% of the cases where the subject’s new ‘Secret Identity’ consciousness gender is the opposite of their physical sex, the subject’s body will undergo a physical transformation and develop the secondary sexual characteristics of the Secret Identity consciousness.

For example, a male subject with a female Secret Identity consciousness will typically develop &lt;redacted&gt;, their voice will become more feminine, and their &lt;redacted&gt; may invert into a rough facsimile of a &lt;redacted&gt;, but they will retain their testicles, and will not have a uterus or ovaries develop

A female subject with male Secret Identity consciousness will typically have her &lt;redacted&gt; reduced drastically, if not totally reabsorbed, and her &lt;redacted&gt; will convert into a rough facsimile of a &lt;redacted&gt;, she will have the ability to get an &lt;redacted&gt;, but will retain her ovaries and uterus.

It goes without saying that these transformations can potentially be quite painful, and it is best that any subjects showing signs of physical changes to match the Secret Identity consciousness should be restrained during this process, to insure they do not eject the SD card or remove 4747.

In approximately 1-2% of cases of this physical transformation process, the transformation will be permanent when 4747 is removed and the subject’s original consciousness returns, the subject will be stuck in their dimorphic body, this error occurs more commonly in males who have a female consciousness created by 4747.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-03-21-220434","1647896674","None","False","0","i1kvoji","True","t3_t9wgmw","False","t1_i1kvoji","True","t3_t9wgmw","/r/AIDungeon/comments/t9wgmw/ai_dungeon_came_up_with_an_idea_im_developing/i1kvoji/","1655720663","1","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

A D-class subject was brought into the testing chamber, and directed to pick up 4747-C, The D-Class looked after 4747-C with suspicion, it looked far too innocuous, there had to be a catch, an ulterior motive, the D-class looked directly at the mirrored one way glass he knew the researchers were behind, observing him, and asked ""What are you trying to prove here?""

""That's classified,"" was all the researcher would tell him, the D-class was then directed to state his D-class identity number, and then put on 4747-C.

""Alright then,"" said the D-class, ""I'm D-4641.""

""That's right,"" said the researcher, ""now go ahead and put on 4747-C, wait approximately a minute, and state your name or D-class ID number, be sure to describe any unusual sensations, or thoughts you experience once you put on 4747-C”

""What are you going to do to me?""

""We're going to see if you're suitable for the experiment,"" said the researcher, ""nothing more than that.""

""You're going to try to mess with my head, aren't you?""

""I'm not trying to mess with your head,"" said the researcher, ""I'm trying to see if your head can be *messed* with. Do you feel anything unusual yet?""

""I don't feel anything at all,"" said the D-class, ""In fact, this feels more like a dream than anything else.""
""That's interesting,"" said the researcher,


&gt; You say ""Have you put on 4747-C yet?""


""I'm about to,"" said the D-class, ""What happens if I do?""

""You'll find out soon enough,"" said the researcher.

D-4641 then put on 4747-C, and waited. He was directed to look into the mirror again, and was asked to describe what he was experiencing, any changes to his mind, his body, or his senses.

""Well,"" said D-4641, ""I feel like I'm floating, and the room around me is getting dimmer and dimmer, I feel… lightheaded. I don't feel like myself.""

""When you say you don’t feel like …yourself, what do you mean, exactly?"" asked the researcher.

""Well, it's sort of like my personality is morphing into something else, someONE else, I'm not sure what. I feel like there's a chance I might lose myself completely, I can’t really describe the sensation, it’s like my mind is being …replaced.""

“That’s what we expected would happen with this device, please, continue describing everything you feel happening to you.”

“Okay, I will, but why am I naked?” Asks D-4641, ""Am I supposed to be naked?""

""That is a part of the experiment, I'm afraid,"" said the researcher.

""Well, can't you just put some clothes on me? I'm naked, and I feel really weird, I don't feel like myself, and I'm scared,"" said D-4641,

""I'm sorry, but that is not up to us to decide, I'm afraid. The O5 council decided that this would be part of the experiment. Now, you'll have to bear with it for the time being.""

""Well, when are you going to do something about 
this? I mean, you're making me all weird, and I don't feel like myself, I don't even look like myself. I feel like some weird mix between a woman and a man, I'm scared, I don’t understand, I am …was… a guy, why am I growing TITS?! I mean they’re nice and all but… WAIT! WHERES MY DICK?!? IT JUST DISAPPEAR…”

(Researcher notes; test 4747-C-1) D-4641’s voice stopped as the subject lost consciousness, subject’s body seemed to be in flux, it developed a pair of &lt;redacted&gt;, and it appears that subject’s &lt;redacted&gt; was in the process of inverting into a rough facsimile of a &lt;redacted &gt;.

subject was unconscious for approximately 3 minutes during the …transformation? Alteration?, when subject regained consciousness,  it was in the form of a female, with long brown hair and a pair of large, round, brown eyes, a slim figure, subject’s voice Was female, and subject identified themselves by a different name, subject stated its name as ""Jessica"".

(Researcher notes; test 4747-C-2) Test subject D-4641 (currently self identifying as ‘Jessica’) was then shown a picture of a man, (the picture was that of D-4641) and was asked to identify the person. Jessica was unable to recognize the man in the picture. Jessica was then asked if she had any memories of the man in the picture, if she knew him, perhaps someone from her past? Jessica stated that she did not, that the man in the picture was a stranger to her. Jessica was then asked if she knew anything about the man in the picture, if she had ever seen him before. Jessica stated that she had not, that she had only just woke up, and Jessica was then asked if she felt any different, if anything seemed different about her.

Jessica responded angrily ""well, you mean ASIDE from being Buck naked and being ogled by creepy guys in lab coats?! Can I please get some fucking CLOTHING?! or do you pervs get off on abducting women and stripping them naked for god knows what?!"" Proceeding to them attempt to cover her chest and crotch with her arms…which look awkward and strange. Jessica then sat down in a chair, put her head in her hands, and cried.

The test chamber door opened, and D-4641's cellmate, D-4642, who is a large, intimidating looking man of Middle Eastern descent, entered the room, carrying a complete set of clothing for D-4641/Jessica, a standard D-class female jumpsuit and set of female undergarments. this was an impromptu test to see if either D-class would recognize the other, as 4641 looked nothing like their previous form, and to see if 4641/Jessica would know how to put on the undergarments.

When 4642 saw that the subject was a crying naked female, 4642’s reaction was to recoil in shock, and cover his eyes. 4641/Jessica looked up from her lap and saw 4642, and her eyes widened in fear, as she started crying again. 4642 then took a step forward, and said ""Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

4642 was then returned to his cell, and 4641/Jessica was asked to tell researchers about her life and any particular events of interest, to go deep back into ‘her' memories…

(Researcher notes; test 4747-C-3) Jessica tells researchers that she was born in a small village in the mountains of Nepal, that her father was a blacksmith and that her mother was a homemaker. Jessica says that her life was not unusual, that she had many friends and that her family had a good standard of living. Jessica says that she has no idea how she got here, that the last thing she remembers is being on a train, traveling to the city of Chicago. Jessica says that she doesn't know where the hell she is, that she doesn't even know what city she's in, she has no idea what's going on, and she’s utterly terrified, she says she doesn’t remember breaking any laws, and that she has a relatively quiet life…

The researcher asks ‘Jessica' her age, and birthday. Jessica tells the researcher that she is 21 years old, that she was born on the 22nd of November, that her birthday is on a Saturday, and that she was in the city of Chicago for the weekend.

‘Jessica' is then asked if she remembers where she got the military-style dog tags on a gold rope chain she's wearing around her neck, and the significance of them, if any…

Jessica tells the researcher that the chain was a gift from her boyfriend, that it is a fairly common thing for people to do when they first meet, and that the tags themselves are just a way for her to remember who she is, and where she came from. Jessica says that she doesn't really know where she's going or what she's doing, that she doesn't even know why she's here.

‘Jessica' is then asked if she's absolutely sure that everything she's remembering is true, and that she's not just imagining the whole thing. Jessica tells the researcher that everything is true, that she knows she was born in Nepal and that her father is still alive. Jessica says that she doesn't remember her mother, and that she doesn't know why she was in the city of Chicago.

Jessica is then asked if ""D-4641"" holds any meaning for her? Does it trigger any memories, or have any significance to her? Jessica says that the name ""D-4641"" means nothing to her, and that she has no idea what the letters could stand for. Jessica says that she would like to forget everything that happened to her today, and that she doesn't want to remember anything about it ever again.

The researchers behind the mirrored glass scribble frantic notes during the test, and are generally pleased with the progress so far, ""this test was a total success, 4641 has not only undergone a complete repression of his consciousness, and replacement with a new consciousness, but the new consciousness has a fully realized backstory, and believes it has always been ‘Jessica'! There now is only one final test, we need to instruct ‘Jessica' to remove 4747-C and see if D-4641's consciousness returns, if he remembers his identity as ‘Jessica' and if his body will return to its male form, or if it will retain any female alterations…""

The researchers behind the glass have their eyes glued to the screen, watching for any changes in D-4641's condition.

‘Jessica' hears the researcher's voice over the speaker, ""Jessica, thank you for your assistance, we were able to get some excellent data, there is one final step to this test, then you will be released, we need you to take off that gold rope chain with military dog tags you're wearing, put it back on the table, and then lay back on the hospital bed behind you, we would appreciate your cooperation."" Jessica complies, removes 4747-C, places it on the table, and then lays back on the bed.

Jessica is then asked to close her eyes, and to describe any unusual sensations, feelings, or thoughts she experiences…

Jessica tells the researchers that she feels like she is floating, that she can see a faint outline of the ceiling above her, and that there is a light breeze blowing through the room. Jessica says that she feels dizzy, that her vision is getting blurry, and that she can't see anything else but the faint light above her. Jessica says that she is terrified, and that she wants to go home.

Jessica is told to focus on the light, and relax, let her fears go, that she is completely safe, and to continue reporting any significant changes she experiences…
Jessica says that the light is getting brighter, that she can see it now, and that it is a very pretty light, that it feels good.

The researchers monitoring 4641/Jessica's vitals and EEG report that her brain activity appears to be changing, that there is a slight increase in the delta wave activity, and that it is centered in the left parietal region. The researchers say that this is a very interesting development, and that it could be a sign of a memory retrieval.

Jessica is asked again if D-4641 holds any meaning to her? Does it have any significance? Jessica says that the letter D-4641 has no meaning to her, and that she doesn't know why the researchers want to know what it is. Jessica says that she doesn't want to talk to anyone anymore, and that she doesn't want to be here. Jessica says that she wants to go home.

Jessica is instructed by the researchers to try to get some sleep, and see if anything changes…
Jessica closes her eyes, and drifts off to sleep.

The researchers behind the glass have their eyes glued to the screen, watching for any changes in D-4641's condition.
Jessica continues sleeping.

The researchers behind the glass continue watching over Jessica's condition.
The EEG shows that 4641/Jessica's brainwave patterns are slowly changing, and that there is a slight increase in the theta wave activity, and that it is centered in the right parietal region, the brainwaves appear to be changing back, slowly, to D-4641’s and the ‘Jessica’ consciousness seems to be fading slightly.

However, the 4641/Jessica body appears to be retaining a slight female physical appearance, the face a little softer, the jaw a little more rounded, the nose a little less prominent, the eyes a little more almond-shaped, the &lt;redacted&gt; a little smaller, but still present, the musculature is more masculine, but the &lt;redacted&gt; area still retains distinctly female characteristics, at this point, 4641’s body is rather …androgynous. 

The researchers wake 4641/Jessica to get the reaction to their current physical and mental state.

4641/Jessica awakens with a start, and can sense something has …changed, this body feels …strange. 

4641/Jessica is asked again if D-4641 holds any meaning to them.

4641/Jessica contemplates the question a little deeper, and realizes that the only reason why the letter D-4641 holds any significance to her, is because she was once D-4641.

"[]","False","None","PikeldeoAcedia","1618486137","None","None","[]","None","None","None","text","t2_bjxon9zg","False","False","The first major controversies that I can recall were in late 2020 (particularly in October and November, if I remember correctly), with the addition of microtransactions (to purchase scales), which was also quickly followed by the additions of energy and subscription tiers. As you can probably imagine, quite a lot of users were upset about microtransactions, and also were quite worried that content would be locked behind them.

As mentioned before, the addition of scales were quickly followed by the addition of energy. Energy was initially being A/B tested, and although not all users were affected to begin with, a lot of users were concerned because, firstly, you only had a maximum of 100 energy (and regained 1 energy every 5 minutes, thus meaning that it took a bit over 8 hours to fully replenish your energy from 0), which wasn't exactly much to work with, and secondly, because there had been *no* announcement from Latitude about it at this point; the addition of energy came out of nowhere. The only way to replenish energy was by using scales, which, at this point in time, were still locked behind microtransactions. Understandably, the community was quite upset about the incredibly restrictive energy system, along with the fact that energy could only be replenished by waiting quite a while, or by paying for microtransactions.

However, the controversy surrounding microtransactions and energy didn't really last long. Latitude officially announced energy, ended up increasing the max energy to 2000, and explained that AI Dungeon was *very* costly to run. Most of the community was fairly understanding and found the max energy of 2000 to be acceptable. The introduction of daily rewards also helped to alleviate concerns that content would be locked behind microtransactions, and also helped to further alleviate users' concerns of potentially running out of energy.

Lastly, the subscription tiers were actually a suggestion by the community. Latitude initially wanted to increase subscription prices, but a lot of users suggested that Latitude implement subscription tiers instead, and obviously, that's what Latitude ended up doing. As was mentioned previously, most users were quite understanding when it came to Latitude's financial issues. As a result, there really wasn't much backlash regarding the addition of subscription tiers; for the most part, the backlash was almost solely from power users who found 2000 energy to be too little, and who didn't exactly like the prospect of having to pay for a subscription, or for microtransactions, to avoid running out of energy. Most of the community found it to be an acceptable compromise, though.

There were also some minor controversies in 2020 and early 2021 in the Explore tab. Specifically involving Latitude randomly banning waves of users, and also involving some users' content randomly being removed despite not breaking any rules. It turned out that the issues with content randomly being removed was mostly due to Latitude's awful reporting system; essentially, if a given scenario/adventure/post got reported enough, regardless of if it actually broke any rules, it would automatically be deleted. This resulted in content that people disliked (such as furry content and fetish content) being mass reported and removed despite not actually breaking any rules. I know Latitude, at some point, increased the amount of reports it took for content to be automatically deleted, but I'm unsure if they ever did much more than that to attempt to fix the issue. In regards to the ban waves, *those* were apparently due to Latitude's automated ban system. Although users were able to appeal and were unbanned if they were wrongly banned, I'm not fully sure if the automated ban system was ever actually fixed.

There was a pretty big controversy in the Explore tab in early 2021 (from March to early April). Specifically, involving a user (who went by the name of RandemLiterary) making incest scenarios. Now, the controversy wasn't because the scenarios were incest scenarios. Rather, it was because the upvotes on the user's scenarios were blatantly inflated. Basically *all* of his scenarios got over 100 upvotes in only an hour or two. That might not seem like that much for certain websites, but when the most popular scenarios of a given day only tended to get 150-200 upvotes over the course of a full 24 hours, that was *a lot* of upvotes for a scenario to get in such a short period of time. The user only had a handful of followers, so no one was being notified when they uploaded, either, so it wasn't like they had a ton of followers who all upvoted their scenarios the instant that they were published.

Essentially, people disliked that this user was constantly posting incest scenarios and immediately having them boosted to the top of the Explore page, thus making it more difficult for scenarios from smaller creators to actually be seen, and a lot of users suspected he was likebotting. A lot of users also just disliked seeing scenarios that they found to be gross the moment that they opened the Explore tab. By the way, the fetishes included in the user's scenarios included incest (obviously), piss, lactation, crossdressing, and such. Anyways, it turned out that it was just 4chan trolling. Basically, there was a 4chan thread at the time called /aidg/ (""aidg"" stands for AI Dungeon general; also, although the thread still exists, they've since rebranded as a thread for AI games in general). A user who frequented the thread wanted to troll the ""Explormies"" (a term that users on /aidg/ used to refer to people who mostly, or solely, used Explore; as you can probably tell, the term was a combination of ""Explore"" and ""normie""), and decided to do so by making a bunch of scenarios that he knew people would be grossed out or offended by, but which also didn't break Explore's Community Guidelines, as to not be banned. The user also posted his scenarios on /aidg/ as soon as they were uploaded, and other anons upvoted them. This controversy didn't really have a proper conclusion, though; the only reason it ended was because Explore was removed.

There was a controversy in early 2021 (I forget *exactly* when, but it was in March or early April, fairly soon before the removal of Explore in mid-April, and occured simultaneously with the whole 4chan trolling controversy). Unfortunately, pretty much all of the info about the controversy was in the Posts section of Explore, which was removed months ago, and in now-deleted 4chan threads. So, I'm pretty much solely going off of memory here. Essentially, Latitude had inserted a line of text into the AI's context with *very* high priority. The line of text was something along the lines of ""Choose your adventure"" or ""Choose your story"" or something (again, going off of memory here; I doubt either of those are exactly what the line of text was, but they should give the gist of what the line of text said).

Anyways, as a result, a lot of users experienced a notable drop in quality, along with the AI regurgitating the line of text verbatim, and also very often giving multiple choice questions. Users were confused about why this was, and one of the developers, who goes by WAUthethird (both, on AI Dungeon, and here on Reddit) was confused by Latitude's lack of transparency regarding the situation. According to him, he wasn't allowed to talk about what exactly was going on, but he felt that it wasn't all that big of a deal, and was unsure why Latitude wanted to keep it under wraps so badly. Anyways, a couple of days later, it was revealed that Latitude was doing testing for their planned ""Universes"" feature. Latitude also promised to be more transparent going forward.

So, shortly after Latitude promised to be more transparent, they suddenly removed Explore with no forewarning and failed to give updates about Explore for months, despite having promised, within the first 24 hours of Explore's removal, to give frequent updates about its development. Basically, Explore was removed on April 14th of 2021 (here's [Latitude's blog post](https://latitude.io/blog/explore-update-23-hours-later/) about it, from 23 hours after Explore's initial removal), and obviously, people were upset about such a large part of the game being removed so suddenly, and especially without any warning so shortly after Latitude promised to be more transparent with users. Although the devs were fairly involved in the community for the first couple of days after Explore's removal, they soon went silent regarding Explore for quite a while.

Then came the filter, on April 27th (officially announced on April 28th). I'm just going to casually direct you to [this r/Hobbydrama post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/otzp7l/video_games_ai_dungeon_how_to_cause_your/) regarding the filter controversy. That's the most in-depth explanation of the controversy that I know of. Also, to add to that post, on the topic of the moderation of private stories being outsourced to random strangers on the internet, it later turned out to be OpenAI that did the outsourcing. Apparently without Latitude's knowledge or permission. The post also doesn't mention that Explore has since been brought back (although now called ""Search"").

Also, during the whole filter controversy, people were also quite disappointed in the updates Latitude had been making to the game. Most of the updates were such incredibly minor changes that they just weren't really worth mentioning in the update notes, or at most, should've just been mentioned as ""Miscellaneous minor changes"" in the update notes, or something. Instead, Latitude commented on *every single* minor change they made. They mentioned that they were A/B testing the placement of a single button (yes, that actually happened), they described every tiny change they made to World Info (slight placement changes, the additions or removals of buttons, and such), every minor bug fix, etc. Some features were removed as well, some the Classic AI, the option to show/hide World Info, the Posts and comments in Explore (once Explore was brought back, of course), and such. They were also completely ignoring the controversy surrounding the filter, the data breach, the moderation outsourcing, and such. I remember a few people who genuinely thought Latitude was actively *trying* to make the community more pissed than they already were with all of the updates that either made the game worse or did nothing even remotely noteworthy.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-03-26-003553","1648251353","None","1648340132.0","0","i24pz1z","False","t3_tnxg75","False","t1_i24pz1z","False","t1_i24pvq2","/r/AIDungeon/comments/tnxg75/can_someone_help_explain_all_of_the_controversies/i24pz1z/","1655700830","19","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

AI Dungeon was just the first prototype of the grander vision. It’s why we’ve been pushing to expand beyond a single offering. 

In all seriousness, this feature was in AI Dungeon but really didn’t work and like most of the features we’ve removed, will be better to build into a robust platform vs vs the Frankenstein approach of the early days.

We have a working prototype game of this internally that was pretty awesome to see. Characters, stats, rolling mechanics … it’s all coming. 

It’s going to take time to make it all real in voyage, but the v1 early version of creator tools is being actively tested by our alpha group already. It’s fun to see the daily feedback and revisions. Our goal is that you could use those to build your own version of AI Dungeon and way beyond that.

“All the old bugs from 2020 are still there” I’d appreciate more details since as head of product it’s literally my job to work these out. We work on bugs daily as a team and while we still have a lot of work to do we’ve had scores of players excited and thankful to see things improving. 

And the theory that Nick is actually me made me laugh more than the theory that Nick is just the AI. I mean, I did come in and take over PR given my experience leading product teams in the past, which typically includes the public facing elements as well. So I guess that makes me the PR guy? Last August and September I spent over half of my time working on repairing the community relationships. But now it’s maybe 10% of what I do … if that. 

The early team, like many seed stage startups, was dev focused and didn’t have a lot of PR experience. And then to deal with the cluster that OpenAI fueled … I don’t envy those that had to try to navigate all of it. 

Most of my time is spent working with Nick to clarify the short and long term vision, getting the team aligned around how well get there, and then driving execution and helping the team level up to where we need to be. Hyper growth companies tend to grow significantly faster than people. AI Dungeon grew so fast that just keeping up has been a major challenge. Good problem to have, but tricky at times.

The answer to your question is: **NO, unfortunately Dragon-OA (GPT-3) is STILL vastly superior than Dragon (Jurassic-1 Jumbo).**  Given that AI21 Labs claimed that Jurassic-1 was much better than GPT-3, one would have hoped that our stories would be better and the writing more detailed and creative.  Instead, it is SLOW at generating text, constantly repeats text, gets easily confused and doesn't understand the context and direction of my story. 😣

For a 178B parameter model, **it's an embarrassment at how bad Jurassic-1 is compared to GPT-3**.  I tend to believe that Dragon is slightly better than Wyvern-Hydra...but you SHOULD expect a 178B parameter model to outperform a 20B parameter model, right?!

Now before you start wandering to NovelAI, here's my personal experience with Euterpe summed up in two words: **It (Euterpe) sucks**.  I know there are many people online who swear that Euterpe is just as good/better than Dragon-OA.  But for me...***I got BORED with NovelAI (Euterpe) after just a couple days***.  Yes, I've used the Author's Note, Lorebook, memory and custom AI modules.  I honestly had a better time using Griffin than Euterpe...although its really not saying much.  I can't play with Griffin for more than 30 minutes without missing Dragon-OA.

Anyways...that's MY two cents.

Even when keyword-based censorship was in full effect, AI Dungeon was still able to generate cohesive text and rather complex sentences.

Today... As you have observed, the AI seems to be numb.

I have run the same prompt in both AI Dungeon and NovelAI a few times over the last year or so. AI Dungeon used to have an edge, although NovelAI was working pretty well.

It's gotten progressively worse as the developer has introduced censorship in a bid to battle sexualization of minors. The AI will refuse to generate certain phrases, and flags your stories for review if it detects certain phrases. For example, in the past the phrase ""giving a child a watermelon"" would be flagged, because it contained ""child"" and slang for breasts: ""melon."" After some research some users developed a script to completely avoid choice phrases and outputs in order to avoid breaking the rules, and these users were subsequently banned - for trying to make a tool to follow the new rules.

Despite these efforts the developer left OpenAI (the AI platform they were using to generate outputs), presumably because OpenAI did not like the sorts of things people had been using it for.

- No. Assuming you last played back when Dragon used GPT-3 Davinci, it's actually gotten worse. Dragon now uses AI21's Jurassic-1 Jumbo model, and it's generally just worse than what OpenAI Dragon was. A *lot* more prone to repetition as well. However, there's a new ""Wyvern"" model that uses GPT-NeoX. I'd personally say Wyvern is somewhat better than what current Dragon is; although it doesn't really compete with old Dragon.



- No, Latitude has moved away from OpenAI. Griffin now uses GPT-J 6B, and Dragon, as mentioned before, now uses Jurassic-1 Jumbo.



- Eh, maybe. AI Dungeon is better now than what it was during the controversy, but I still think it's significantly worse than it was back in 2020 and early 2021. Other similar applications have also gotten better over time. AI Dungeon is certainly usable, but it might be worth it to check out [NovelAI](https://novelai.net/) and [HoloAI](https://writeholo.com/); those are currently AI Dungeon's main competitors.

As I said many times, the dialogue is extremely one dimensional, and characters behave like patrick star from the newer seasons of Spongebob. You can't have fun anymore at all, everything is an illusion of choice cause the story derails and changes way too easily. You can never introduce the piece of garbage to any sort of action no matter how small, or it grows way too addicted and refuses to move on. Forget anything about describing a magical place and how far away it is or how impossible it is to reach, cause it'll always say you are nearing or reaching the place in the next prompt or two like someone who took one look at an important instruction manual and claims they know everyTHING.

Its way too much for me to write at this time, but I have wrote it plenty of times.

Edit: My favourite is when this close minded illusion of choice, no longer interesting or creative AI gave a Warhammer a ""Flame sword"" description smh

Dragon is hit or miss now with a lot of misses. I've had some adventures where Dragon is incredible. No repeats and good world data usage. When it works, it's really good.

I'm not sure how you'd slow down the player from meeting the Miasma Harbinger, it was a fun encounter, but I killed it.  
The transforming idea was both fun and cool, the AI seemed to know what was happening.  
Tried to lean into the transforming badass thing, and that worked really well.  
The AI handled the military stuff alright, the Radio worked, the background was fun.  
While being a nameless badass was fun, maybe have the option to choose your code name or something?  
Most of the stuff worked.  
I felt like I speed ran it, so I might play it again.  
3 days to find the Miasma Harbinger works, it has a sense of urgency, the game just decided I'd find it after not much looking, that might have been because I used the name quite a few times, as my person had a single mission, destroy it.  
I uploaded the stuff, hopefully it shows up, and you'll be able to see my playthrough.   
Stating again, role playing a cybernetic transforming badass, is fun.

I each AI to work better than other ones at completely random increments. 

But if I had to pick just one, Griffin-beta (which is now overtaken old Griffin and is now just called Griffin)  
Seems to produce the least amount of errors.

\\- Wyvern-Hydra: Seems to be good a lot of the time but is limited in certain instances (especially battles or fight scenes)  
\\- Wyvern: It's typically believed that Wyvern-Hydra is superior, so I haven't used much base Wyvern yet.   
\\- Griffin-Hydra: Honestly, I find myself going back to base Griffin more. I haven't compared them head to head though. It seems to be pretty coherent most of the time the problem I started running into with it is more repetition issues.  

\\- Griffin: (which was up until recently, was known as Griffin-Beta) Seemingly the most coherent and consistent of the 5.  But does suffer a little bit the same way Wyvern-Hydra does and that is combat. 

\\- Dragon: Okay so Dragon is like a pair of dice, most of the time nothing, but if you roll 7 or 11 or in other words, Dragon really does a spectacular job that outmatches any of the other 4 AI's it especially excels in following WI and memo/author's notes.

That is very reasonable, I understand.

I honestly used to have fun with this one scenario a while back that was called _A.I Visual Novel_, or something like that. It isn't around anymore, and I honestly kind of miss it.

_Yes yes, a very weeb-ish scenario,_

But there was a few story starting options on who your character's friend is at the school you're attending, which was Larion High. I never knew it would actually kickstart my love for the Delinquent Genre, _and it wasn't even about that!_ Best stories I've played through to the end.

Loom is a new AI dungeon type game made by the same people on voyage. I think its free. Plus it has a multiverse feature. Needs a lot of work though, but still interesting.

There's also dreamily which isn't as good cause of the garbage stuff it was trained off of, and the illusion of customization. 

The AI was starting to go downhill near the beginning of 2021, i really don't know, then it really plummeted after the controversy. Honestly before the controversy it was still pretty good, nice and interesting and very fun to use, just slightly downgraded. Its a lot of moments I remember from it that made it very realistic, but I'll never forget this one moment where a character called out another for being perverted, instead of friendly and stormed out (Which was 100% accurate considering what happened) with zero derailments.

Everybody uses it for different reasons. I like stories over using it as a game. So if you're using it as a game, the settings I use might not work for you.

First I use story mode as the default and stick with it and never use do or say.

Griffin Hydra works very well, but when I'm not getting great responses from it I switch back over to dragon for a while.

I use styles extensively. I have a couple of Google docs if you want that tells you a lot about using styles and how to set the tone of the scene that you're writing.

Of course I use remember and detailed world info. I change what's in remember and in styles each time the story takes me into a new scene. Like different location or different characters that are in the scene.

I leave the settings pretty much on default. That works for me.

These are two Google docs I made to help cut down some of the confusion about writing styles, author's note, tone and everything that you can put into Styles in AI dungeon.

Part one covers writing styles

Part two covers mood and tone and all of that.

For the AI to remember info from before the final scenario option, you still *need* to activate the World Info entries for the relevant info. Having so much World Info can also result in World Info entries being activated and taking up space in the AI's context when the info said World Info entries isn't exactly needed at the time. For a prompt that's only been extended by, say, ~1000 characters or so using scenario options, you could probably use World Info (or Memory, for that matter) to get the AI to remember the info without too much issue.

The blacklist filter seems to only check full words that are separated by only spaces, not punctuation. So, by banning just a single word, it can still show up at the end of a sentence, the first or last word in quotation marks, or right next to commas. To circumvent this, you can ban the same word with the punctuation next to it, but it's really tedious. If you want to ban the word ""human"" in all it's forms, you have to ban all the following:
&gt;Human

&gt;Human.

&gt;Human,

&gt;Human?

&gt;Human!

&gt;Human.""

&gt;Human?""

&gt;Human!""

&gt;""Human

&gt;""Human,

&gt;""Human""
