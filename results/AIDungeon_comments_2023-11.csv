>Can you elaborate a bit more on what you mean about highlighting on read mode? What platform are you on? 

I am a writer who uses primarily the ipad (so while I have AID on my android phone, I haven't updated yet). Since I write as much as I do, I sometimes transfer over the text from AID to another app for offline writing, edits where mine & the AI's writing could be better, and adding more to the writing in general (since every input is separate in play mode, it makes it difficult to fluidly edit while in AID).

By ""transfer over"" I am referring to: setting it in read mode, long hold or double tap to highlight a word in the adventure, then drag the indicator for the highlight to select more; originally, if I dragged the indicator to the bottom of the screen, it would auto scroll so that I could continue to highlight the rest of the page; then I'd copy the selection and paste in the other app (currently, the issue I mentioned is the fact that it no longer scrolls when I highlight—making it infinitely harder to do it).

When I had internet back or was done writing/editing in the other app, I'd copy it back into the adventure and continue playing in AID.

Now that I type this out, it seems objectively like a tedious process; alternatively, you fine folks could implement an export function on our own adventures. That'd genuinely be cool.

But if re-allowing highlight scrolling is easier, honestly I can make do with just that. I really love AID and have been playing/using it for years, so writing alongside the AI like this keeps me engaged and having fun with it.","False","False","False","None","None","None","None","0","1698799900.0","2023-11-01-015140","1698799900.0","None","0","1698853913.0","0","k7b1wnt","False","None","t3_17gch5m","False","None","None","None","[]","t1_k7b1wnt","True","0","t1_k792v7i","/r/AIDungeon/comments/17gch5m/sneak_peak_at_textdisplay_options_coming_to/k7b1wnt/","None","","[]","1698799914","False","3","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","1698799931","3","[]","True"

We’re going to introduce themes soon, and we shared a teaser for that recently. I think you’ll see it’s more than just color options: https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/17gch5m/sneak_peak_at_textdisplay_options_coming_to/

Phoenix is no longer in Beta, it’s the main version of AI Dungeon. We’re just now rolling out the mobile apps for it, and that is a major project. For a big launch like this, we anticipated we would discover new bugs as more players started using the new version. Right now, there are more than we're comfortable with so we've temporarily paused our rollout of the Phoenix mobile apps. Our entire team is focused on resolving bugs and pushing fixes right now, and we expect to be able to resume the rollout shortly after we make it through the bugs list.

Legacy is available at legacy.aidungeon.com. We shared in a blog post more about the plan for Legacy (https://latitude.io/blog/sharpening-our-focus-on-ai-dungeon). In short, we have a very small team and wont be able to support both of them long term. We’re going to make sure we address key player feedback before Legacy is retired, though.

Images attached to the stories listed on the landing page are unnecessary, and many are unrelated to the stories listed, they appear to be chosen randomly

- We’ve released a more condensed content card view
- We’re exploring an “Icon Button” setting for the play screen, so that experienced players who understand the actions can have a more concise set of actions buttons
- We’re working on a custom image capability so creators can find images that are not only relevant, but showcase their content.

Most features from Legacy were brought over directly. In places we made changes (such as the Do/Say/Story/See interaction), we made those changes as a direct result of either player feedback, or extensive user research. The game screen in particular was difficult for new players to learn and understand, since actions like “Continue” didn’t even have a button. After watching countless new players struggle with the do/say/story/see button, we knew that needed adjusting too. So far all the design changes have performed better for new players in both qualitative and quantitative analysis. 

We know that some of these changes are upsetting to our experienced players. We’re doing our best to balance building the best product we can while also trying to avoid changing things in a way that is too drastic for experienced players. Change is hard. 

The Phoenix update will enable us to add new features and capabilities that weren’t possible with Legacy. With our small team, we won’t be able to support both versions indefinitely but you can use Legacy still at legacy.aidungeon.com.

If you want to learn a bit more about how things have changed since 2020, I'll drop a few articles you can check out that get into the details of what happened and what's changed. 

The TL;DR is we've changed AI providers to ones with a better reputation for data security, and our privacy policy has been updated. Unpublished player stories are never moderated. We've also changed our communications strategy to be extremely transparent with everything that goes on (like these recent patch notes [https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/17n71mw/patch\\_notes\\_for\\_nov\\_3another\\_massive\\_set\\_of\\_bug/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/17n71mw/patch_notes_for_nov_3another_massive_set_of_bug/)) 

Plus...the game has gotten better, as have the models :)

Don't mean to be dick about it, but the fact that it needs its own FAQ also kinda proves my point of things needing more clicks and work to get the same things done.

I also understand the desire to hype up the new version and UI, but I have yet to see one thing that I like better or that benefits my use.

I've been using AID for a few years now and the thing that bothers me more than a plain but very functional UI, like legacy, is the fact that the 'newer' models have started to being utterly incapable of staying in a Third Person perspective... AGAIN, despite the all other 3000 actions in the story being in third person - with the function enabled.
Or that the model is still incapable of remembering basic relationships - like I'm all for kink and less censorship in the stories, but no, my character and his brother aren't lovers...

And it's lately started to ignore full stops (.) and the AI simply continues from somewhere in the previous sentence.

I also have 33k tokens and 20k+ scales... with absolutely no use for it. The only actual benefit out of my current membership is supposed faster AI responses... which are debatable.

Not trying to be a party pooper, but as I said, I really see no actual benefit in Phoenix - maybe with the one exception of getting access to ChatGPT... which requires moderate censorship for violence and sexual themes.

So yes, this is an egocentric point, and sure, I could cancel or lower my subscription, but I have a lot of good memories and a lot of stories here.  And that too, makes the switch harder, because now, creating a spin off or an alt version of a story is gonna be a lot of extra work.

We have FAQ articles on both obvious and less used features (you’d be surprised which ones are most used), however, the Erase to Here is definitely less visible than the old Undo to Here was. This was a feature we added in after feedback from players and we’re already exploring ideas for adding it back as a more obvious “button” type of interaction.

I think it’s a fair critique that you don’t see many improvements in the new version that makes it better for you. The reason we invested in this new update wasn’t just to change things up, as you suggested. The Legacy version had become unstable enough that we weren’t able to add new features that players we requesting without introducing a number of bugs. This was a rewrite of our front end and core systems to be more stable and extensible, which has already proven out in how quickly we’ve been able to add new features based on player feedback (such as the list view) and others that are coming (themes, custom images, etc). 

In short, this upgrade is an investment so we can add better functionality. In hindsight, we think there could have been a different build path where we were able to do more incremental improvements while also building in new functionality. Hard to say for certain.

The third person issue isn’t one I’ve heard of yet, but I’ll share that with the team and see if we’ve received other reports. And in terms of managing relationships, this is certainly a common issue with language models. You’ve done this a while, so you’re probably familiar with the advice to use memory to mitigate the issue. I’m often surprised that even the way memory is phrased can improve the outputs. Our discord server is full of players who may have additional ideas or suggestions there. Our CEO, Nick, is working on a new game mode called Heroes which, we think, will significantly improve these types of AI “forgetfulness” issues. It’s a much more RPG like game, and contains a state engine that helps to track story facts and keep the story on track. 

We’re starting to work on ways to use Credits and Scales (I assume you meant Credits, not tokens?). Credits can be used for image generation, and scales for tipping other players or getting Avatars, but those are limited uses. We’re aware and working on that. 

The primary benefits to your membership would be 1) access to premium models (both Dragon and ChatGPT), 2) longer context length (which I hope you’re taking advantage of), 3) access to image generation, and 4) AI Speeds. The speeds benefit depends on which tier you use. All premium tiers get fastest Griffin speeds, and Legend gets fastest Dragon and ChatGPT speeds. 

Hopefully some of that helps address the concerns you raised. Happy to elaborate on anything or answer other questions. We know change is hard, and we’re doing our best to adjust as we get more feedback. This new update is only the starting point, we’re going to keep improving!","False","False","False","None","None","None","None","0","1699406714.0","2023-11-08-022514","1699406714.0","None","0","False","0","k8aq8x1","False","None","t3_17po0zn","False","None","None","None","[]","t1_k8aq8x1","True","0","t1_k8aaulb","/r/AIDungeon/comments/17po0zn/didnt_realize_liking_the_phoenix_ui_was_such_an/k8aq8x1/","None","","[]","1699406728","False","2","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","1699406745","2","[]","","",""

I've also started using what I'm calling 'landmarks', e.g keywords that won't typically be randomly generated like 'prologue' that let me make storycards that will map to a point in the story - I start the story with 'Prologue' and put everything I want to come up at the beginning of a story in a storycard that uses the uses the Prologue keyword, so that storycard is active until Prologue falls off the AIs internal radar.

So if you've got stuff you want to hit at specific points you can type 'Chapter 1', 'Chapter 2' etcetera.

Also while in game, not a huge fan of the gradient they added. It’s not an eye pleaser for me at the least and takes away the simple black and white charm. Not to mention, I feel taking away the input box permanently until you decide to press “take a turn” really takes away at the simplicity it had prior. And this might be just a nit pick of mine, but text is just way bigger than before which makes it feels more cluttered.


It may be just me, but the new UI feels like it’s trying to be sleek which takes away the simplicity it had before.

Sam is more emotionally sensitive and empathetic, and often grapples with difficult choices, ethical dilemmas, and the consequences of his actions. Sam is a skilled hunter when it comes to dealing with supernatural threats. He is highly proficient in various weapons and tactics to confront and eliminate paranormal creatures.

We're working on the images right now, this is a common point of feedback we've gotten. We think images have a place, but agree they aren't relevant enough right now and it makes them feel like wasted space.

Both Legacy and Phoenix use the same AI models (although Phoenix has ChatGPT as an option, which Legacy doesn't), so any degradation of quality isn't going to be because of the update. Over the years, we've gotten feedback about the AI getting better or worse despite no changes being made to the models. Our feeling is that the experience with AI is so personal, that there's a good chance players can have a streak where the AI is doing exactly what they want, and other streaks where it just isn't cooperating. So, even though there haven't been model changes along with the Phoenix update, it's very likely you're having one of those moments where the AI just isn't doing what you'd like. 

If you do think there's something odd going on, enabling ""Improve the AI"" helps us a lot. We also appreciate you bringing up this discussion because often, when multiple players are having a similar experience, it can make it easier to diagnose an issue.

#1 Inability to see what you're writing in memory or authors note when creating a custom scenario. My phones keyboard covers up the text with no way to scroll down. Currently I have to copy and paste custom memory and AN from a notepad app. This is probably a bug but a easily the most frustrating one.
#2 Battery drain. One of the things I liked about AID legacy was the lack of large battery usage that other games have. Now it could be my phone  but it seems to drain a whole lot faster. Also the app now crashes.

I have a lot of UI concerns too, but hopefully they get addressed in the near future. The most important being easier access to my Scenarios. Followed by being able to see tags easily while searching public stuff.

In one adventure, I put something like, “Describe people’s appearances in detail. Emphasize facial features and clothing details.” That seemed to work when new characters were introduced, but again, not consistently. If you want more descriptions, you might try using a Do action to say you’re scrutinizing a person or place.

Dragon and Azure are WAY better than Griffin. Things are less random, it remembers more of the story as you go along, and you can fine tune settings including response length and how much data as sent to the model. (Increasing response length will actually really help get you more descriptive text, too)

Here’s one example of an adventure I’ve done with Dragon 2.1: [Supernatural: Sam & Dean Hunt Vampires](https://play.aidungeon.com/adventure/UthIt192Yrhx/supernatural-sam-and-dean-hunt-vampires)

Excerpt showing some naturally descriptive text:

DO: You notice it's almost midnight and suggest you stop at a motel.

""Dean, we should stop at the next motel. It's almost midnight, and we need to rest before we continue the hunt,"" you say.

Dean nods, and you both keep an eye out for a motel. Eventually, you spot one on the side of the road, its neon sign flickering in the night. You pull into the parking lot, and Dean heads to the front desk to secure a room while you gather your gear from the Impala.

DO: You meet Dean in the lobby with your things.

As you enter the lobby of the motel, you see that it's a classic roadside joint with flickering fluorescent lighting and the scent of old cigarette smoke hanging in the air. The receptionist, an older woman with a raspy voice, checks you in quickly and hands over the key.

Dean leads the way to your room at the far end of the complex. It's a typical motel room with faded green walls and generic artwork hanging above the beds.

SAY: You say ""I hope Dad is ok. We haven't heard a word from him since he sent us his location.""

""I know, but Dad always was a lone wolf,"" Dean replies, setting his duffel bag on the bed. ""He'll contact us if he needs our help.""

You nod, still feeling anxious. It wasn't like your father to go silent for so long.
Dean seems to sense your worry and lays a reassuring hand on your shoulder. ""Don't worry, Sammy. We've got this. We'll take care of whatever's out there, just like we always do.""","False","False","False","None","None","None","None","0","1699773651.0","2023-11-12-082051","1699773651.0","None","0","False","0","k8wgxv3","False","None","t3_17td0u4","False","None","None","None","[]","t1_k8wgxv3","False","0","t3_17td0u4","/r/AIDungeon/comments/17td0u4/how_should_i_use_authors_notes_to_get_more/k8wgxv3/","None","","[]","1699773667","False","5","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","1699773682","5","[]","","","",""

The things I don't like about the UI are small, and the upgrades seem, to me, to be worth the trade off. Just the consolidation of Worlds and Storycards is a blessing - In the six weeks prior to Phoenix I never did figure out how to get the world building system to work right. Now it's simple.

I myself am happy they are updating and keeping the game going, rather than shutting it down. Very thankful that an amazing tool like this is available for free. The devs are also learning from their mistakes, are active in all community locations (even here), and own up to their mistakes. They're doing good to me and redeeming themselves slowly. Give it a little more time and hopefully it will be up to your standards. I've noticed a huge improvement in the Griffin model with this new update.

There isn't ""stamina"" or ""energy"" like in the past. The free version of AI Dungeon is still free and unlimited using our Griffin AI model. However, we've been giving free players limited access to ChatGPT, which is normally an AI model for paid subscribers only. The bar is simply a way to track how many of these special actions you get each day. You can play on Griffin without that. We're adjusting the design of this to be more clear, because it is confusing currently.

On the design and style, we spent a LOT of time researching and testing our design. The changes were made to address specific player feedback, and to make the game more intuitive for new users. We've carefully watched our analytics, done extensive user testing, and gathered player feedback and the change has been successful in most areas. Experienced players, understandably, have had some frustration as things have changed from what they are used to. We're listening to feedback and making changes as a result. Some have already been implemented (like condensed views) and others are coming (like custom images, an ""icon only"" button option, etc). 

Hopefully, some of that is helpful. Happy to answer any more questions or listen to any other input or feedback you might have.

Third person narrative has always had issues, but at least with the previous versions, at the end, it only happened occasionally.

The current version is infuriating! It switched to 'you' within a single output. One sentence is fine, the next it either uses 'you' for the main character or decides to just add a new one who is observing what's happening.

It's annoying and because of it, I've been playing a lot less. I can't be arsed to correct every damn output... especially since 'retries' have also become crap and usually are 90%+ the exact same text.

A) Memory, Author Notes, initial Prompt, tags, and basically every field should be special storycards, keep them where they are in the interface, but when you export/import cards they are right there at the top on the json file and you can edit them and reimport them. 

If there's no specific reason not to this should include scripts as well.

B) I still want some variant of story card pools where if you update a story card it updates all scenarios with that story card.

I think you should create a Merge storycard that is just ""when you you generate an adventure merge storycards from these other scenarios with the storycards in this scenario. If there are duplicates overwrite them with this scenario's storycards"".

----

A) ${variables} should be available to any storycard not just memory and authors notes. Let it modify any field in the interface.

B) ${variables} should have defaults that show in the scenario on the main  interface, e, g, a Title ""${character.name}'s Adventure in Zork"" in the scenario would show up as is in the scenario Screen, but ""${character.name}{Jack}'s Adventures with Blake in Zork"" shows up as ""Jacks Adventure in Zork"" on the Scenario Page, but if I input ""Pug"" it converts it to ""Pug's Adventure with Blake in Zork"" on the adventure page.

C) Set up hidden random variables that are answered by the AI when converting over from the Scenario to the Adventure. I'm thinking of two ways to do it, one is ?{Best friends Name}{Blake}{Jenna}, or for the really ambitious ?{Best friends Name}{ChatGPT: What is a good name for a best friend?} and submit a request for a name to ChatGPT.

I can think of a thousand reasons that second one may not be feasible or even possible (Surely no one would set up a recursion situation where the AI is generating questions to itself? Oh, I would definitely try to do exactly that and generate self generating story cards.) , but if it's feasible it would be amazing.

But even with just the first one, we're now at a Scenario titled ""Jack's Adventure with Blake in Zork"" generating an Adventure titled ""Pug's Adventure with Jenna in Zork"". Put different Story cards in for Blake and Jenna and you have a lot of flexibility built in from the start without any scripting.","False","False","False","None","None","None","None","0","1700077600.0","2023-11-15-204640","1700077600.0","None","0","False","0","k9efa3e","False","None","t3_17u9paa","False","None","None","None","[]","t1_k9efa3e","True","0","t1_k9eelji","/r/AIDungeon/comments/17u9paa/convenience_of_wi_over_sc/k9efa3e/","None","","[]","1700077617","False","1","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","1700077630","1","[]","","","",""

Great that you bothered to write down about your attempt, just to be sure, have you clicked a dice icon when roll appeared? To actually roll the dice?
If not then I guess we have to rework the design... id that was the case, the game waited for your action.

Regarding -4 modifier, looks like you had really bad lack when your character stats were generated. You can check them out upon clicking on the top bar. Again the design does not help I guess.

My brother has created a discord server and added a link on the main page, there is a bugs channel already, feel free to write there if you like. We will make an update some fixes to stuff you have reported at monday hopefuly. 

Thank you a lot for testing sir. Thats exactly why we posted here so early, to be more aware of the current problems and to check if someone will like it the same way we do. :)

I am super happy that you enjoyed. What do you think about multiplayer feature? We were doscussing making up to 4 person story where each person has to write input in each turn etc. Its substantial effort so we need to have stable version before we proceed with that, but it is doable.

Another thing that just happened a few minutes ago that was quite funny, I teamed up with a goat and a horse to fight some zombie rats and it put both the horse and the goat into my inventory lol. I think that maybe adding a ""companions"" tab on the side or next to the inventory for NPC's that join your party might be beneficial. It would also keep things more coherent.

They picked the second option. They probably could have done that more seamlessly, but refactoring software is hard - I have no idea how many times I've looked at my own code and gone ""Why did I think this was a good idea? *Was* there a reason or am I just stupid?""

We just fixed the bug, so it shouldn't happen anymore. However, please do let us know if you still experience this issue.

Now this leaves the ""Too much story text added in a single step"" issue.    
First I have a few questions, which will help me figure out the solution: 

1. how many words/characters are there in the editable story text (this is all of the text you can select and edit, until you reach the ""Can't edit this far back"" message)?
2. Does the story text contain any big paragraphs or are most paragraphs 5 - 8 sentences? Each paragraph should be separated by new lines.
3. Does the story text contain a lot of characters/symbols that are not part of the English alphabet?

**Here is a potential solution:**  
Try removing text (100 words/ 500 characters) at a time, until the app allows you to generate.

About ""Too much story text added in a single step"" issue:

1. I only try to upload the text that I download from my earlier story to the new one. But it's already collected into two paragraph. first pararaph is the one that I cannot edit, the 2nd one is the one that I can edit but won't generate even though I try to separate it so I have a couple of senteces to have a new paragraph.
2. I already try to separate it but the issue still there.
3. I don't use any symbol.

But The initial story is somehow working again and no more ""Number of generations cannot be 0."" and ""Too much story text added in a single step"" issue. I did turning ON and OFF the memory section. and the probles is go away. So the 2nd story that meant to be as a corrected one is still broken.

We’re currently evaluating two new models (one is in Alpha testing, the other is in internal testing). 

Phoenix didn’t introduce any changes to the AI. We’ve been using the same models and versions for a while now. The feedback we’re seeing lately seems like some of the typical feedback we get about the AI, but since there’s a new update, people are assuming there was a change. Even though we haven’t changed the AI, players can still have better or worse experiences over time. We’ve seen historically that players can have a broad range of experiences with the AI. Sometimes it goes great, and sometimes not so great. Most of the time, this isn’t because of changes we’ve made, but simply the variability of AI performance. We constantly monitor various feedback channels (Reddit, Discord, support emails, reviews, user testing, A/B testing, and analytics) to help us track any issues (like repetition). We’ve heard some players say that adjusting their temperature setting helps them get the experience they want, especially on Griffin which has become a bit more coherent than it used to be, which sometimes leads to it being more repetitive. In the past Griffin, was always the wild child model.

I use the ChatGPT version a lot, the writing is better than the other models, but there always comes a time when the AI does as it pleases.   
  
I find the current Dragon J2 completely idiotic and repeats much more than the other 2 models. The current Griffon version is a little less silly, but also repeats. And I find myself deleting all previous entries.

Trying to get it to work is the best free, low effort thing you can try. I did it for a bunch of time and it's amazing actually. The problem is it likes censorship and it became a problem (at least to me).

Yet, openai ais are hands down the best possible choice. They are smart, original and all kind of stuff. So I decided to take their api and create an app to play rpg solo adventures with it. I paired the best prompt I could come up with with gpt-3. Dude, it felt amazing. Characters were immersive, places real and the stories themselves were original. Then I tried with gpt-4, just to see. I don't think I'll ever play anything else. As a creative, living a story of my own is the best thing in the world.

I felt a bit selfish so I paid like 10 euros and published it on my website. You can play it if you want (for free, of course). I'd love to give people a place to play rpg adventures.

I'm also planning on adding dice rolls, image generation, text to speech and things like that.

The issue actually comes down to payment providers. I can technically do it but wouldn't be allowed to sell credits for it through stripe.

I considered crypto but there are KYC laws.

I could get right up to the line and make it many R17 but crossing that line into adult content introduces a few issues.

In saying that if there is huge demand I could make it open source and locally runnable and accept donations.

Funnily enough I made a post here basically saying similar to I'd figured was the end result here. The Phoenix does NOT have any fanfare behind it nor was going to be any when the Phoenix version creates problems instead of fixing the existing problems that the legacy version has.

I believe the first problem here is that they rush this out when they should've taken some notes down about the legacy version's problems and try to solve that issue with the Phoenix version. 

The second problem is that the Phoenix version came out of the oven way too early to hand out to users. They should've iron out the UI to make it so that old users can navigate it similar to the Legacy version while having new users being able to figure it out without needing assistance. Funnily enough,I'm sure many longtime users were able to learn how to create their own world without any problems in the legacy version.

And their are many more problems I can say here,but I'll wrap up with a final statement here.

In conclusion,the Phoenix version has quite a high expectation of trying to take after what came before it.

1. The stories the Ai generated didn't make much sense. It revolved around a topic and theme but actions didn't seem to register. One minute, a character knew something and in the next response, they didn't. It also didn't finish most of the plot points it introduced and pulled conclusions from nowhere.

2. I kinda like the multiple choice format, but it doesn't feel like I'm writing Fanfic. More like it's a fanfic choose-your-own-adventure. The o ly thing I didn't like was that most of the choices were too similar to distinguish. It often didn't feel like I had a real choice.

3. Discord is an awkward place to generate Fanfic. I don't need to know if someone is exploring their giant furry fetish while I read Ai Harry Potter. I find this problem across ALL discord-based Ai.

A common issue: The screen fading out, forcing me to restart the app.

 One issue im currently facing is that with one specific adventure I cant see the past inputs and it says the prompt for when you start a new adventure but if I read the adventure I can see the text, I also see the previous text pop up sometimes but it disappears after any type of input. 

The AI repeats itself a LOT, I've noticed a lot of the exact same sentences/scenarios. That is not only after retrying but also just across multiple adventures, I see the exact same thing. 

However the AI has gotten a lot better in its writing. Its descriptive and coherent not to mention its smart, Its very clear when the AI uses the information from the story cards and to that I must give some credit to the devs. Its ambitious and I know that when all the updates are out and this version is in its final stages, It will have been a worth while improvement.","False","False","False","None","None","None","None","0","1701191508.0","2023-11-28-181148","1701191508.0","None","0","1701192729.0","0","kb50gmi","True","None","t3_17tj1se","False","None","None","None","[]","t1_kb50gmi","False","0","t1_k95eix9","/r/AIDungeon/comments/17tj1se/letdown/kb50gmi/","None","","[]","1701191524","False","1","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","1701191540","1","[]","True","","",""

The new system has scenarios, adventures and bookmarks in that Order but the search function only find tags for adventures and scenarios and can't see my bookmarks outside the regular scrolling list on profile. 
How do I search specific bookmarks and get it to find them by specific tags. Ex if I type Dragon I expect my bookmarks with Dragon in the full title to pop up but none does. I've typed the full name of scenarios(worlds)  into the search bar but nothing is found as if no bookmarks exist but accessing them normally works fine.

I highly doubt that people preferred the cluttered, overdesigned mess that is the mobile Phoenix UI to the simple, efficient, minimalist Legacy UI

If you want to make ‘under hood’ tweaks to the AI engine, fine, but the USER interface, the part that the USER interacts with, should have remained the one found in Mobile Legacy

The Phoenix UI is cluttered, overdesigned, inefficient, and counterintuitive, and this is after taking time to get used to using it.

Labeled buttons at the bottom of the screen are unnecessary, when an icon button is more space efficient 

I have grown to tolerate, and even slightly like the DO/SAY/STORY/SEE menu, as it doesn’t seem to lock up like the Legacy “sequential taps” buttons, or require going through multiple times if you overshoot your choice 

The graphics used for the adventure pages at the start menu are a waste of space and unnecessary, this is a TEXT adventure (for the most part), a gaudy (and often unrelated) graphic image isn’t necessary and adds needless clutter

Happy to hear any suggestions for how to improve Phoenix. Specifics help, itʻs hard to break down generalized descriptions like ""cluttered, overdesigned, inefficient..."" etc into actionable feedback. 

Labeled buttons is a great example of feedback we listened to. Thereʻs now a setting where you can choose icons only for buttons on the play screen. Give it a try!

The images are going to become far more interesting and relevant. Weʻve just added custom images. Creators are already starting to find ways to use images to help players get a sense for what the scenario is. We also anticipate creators developing a recognizable style that will help their stories stand out to their followers. And, believe it or not, images are actually one of the things a lot of players like about Phoenix (although there have been some fair criticisms that weʻve tried to address).

We are considering a Legacy skin. We just launched skins into Beta today, so give it a look if you haven't already.

I really do want some kind of shared storycard system where if you change a storycard in one spot it updates every scenario using that storycard 'downstream'.

My preference would be a system where when you create a scenario you include one (or ideally more, although at that point you need to establish what order storycards override each other in.) parent Scenarios it copies storycards from, and then the local storycards override any of the parents with the same type & title.

Not only do we consider the Reddit community to be some of our most dedicated users, it’s also where we’ve gotten some of the best feedback. A good portion of the changes we made to Phoenix came from feedback here on Reddit. If you go back through the history of this subreddit, you’ll consistently see our team responding to feedback, whether that feedback is positive, negative, or even insulting at times. They’ve been answering questions, asking for more information, and exploring ideas with players here. We really appreciate everyone who takes the time to share their thoughts and give us feedback. 

So, we’re certainly not dismissing this community. The only thing we’re dismissing is the notion that our survey results aren’t an accurate reflection of our broader community. That’s not dismissive of the feedback or players here, it’s simply an observation of player sentiment distribution on different platforms. 

It doesn’t matter where the feedback comes, or in what form, we’re always going to be listening for ways we can improve and grow.

We could probably write a book about all the lessons we’ve learned from our company’s history. Some of those lessons have been painful for us, and for our players.

Listening to players was what initiated the Phoenix update. Players have requested improvements, updates, and changes to AI Dungeon for a long time that we haven’t been able to accommodate because of the instability of the Legacy version. 

We’ve been listening to players during the entire process of building and launching Phoenix. We launched it initially as a beta earlier this year and have captured and addressed literally thousands of feedback requests, bug reports, etc. We’ve communicated at each step of the way so players could stay up to date on our progress and provide feedback. 

It’s true, we’ve done some things differently than they were in Legacy, and that has been frustrating for some of our longtime users. Adapting to new things is hard, especially when you’re familiar with a particular way of doing things. It’s been a difficult balance to strike between making changes that benefit new players, while making sure things aren’t too different for long time users. 

On the specific items you mentioned, we do have a story read view now (unless I’m misunderstanding what you said is missing there). We just launched themes into beta today so players have more display options. I’m not sure what you mean by the input buttons being limited, but one thing we added recently was an option to make the buttons icons only, which saves space for users who already know what the buttons are and want a more condensed UI. These were all changes we made thanks to feedback from players.

1.) It's harder to navigate. Legacy had that triple equal sign that pulled out a menu with easily accessible options. When I first had a look at Pheonix, I had no idea where to go to access my other stories because you guys decided to merge the profile and ""My stuff"" tabs for no reason.

2.) Scenarios are harder to navigate. Now that you've merged scenarios and worlds I struggle to actually find worlds when searching for them since they're intertwined with an already pretty poor search engine. I also encountered a lovely glitch where I couldn't change the filters for the search engine, they'd just reset.

1. It sounds like there was initial confusion with the change, but that you know where things are at now?

We got consistent feedback that having a single page with all the things you care about made the most sense. That was the reason for the change.

2. Are you seeing that bug with the filter currently? Or something you experienced before? We did add filters so you can find the “Character Creator” type scenarios that are similar to Legacy worlds. Is that the filter you say is (or wasn’t) working?

We discussed the AI feedback as an exec team earlier this week, and I can share a bit about what weʻre seeing. Weʻve been gathering feedback from here, but also looking at our AI evaluation tools, player data, and feedback from other sources. With AI feedback, it can sometimes take a while to find themes and identify issues since everyone's experience can be so unique (which makes playing so fun, just makes diagnosing troubles harder).

Each time we release new and improved models, we address the main issues and then the next layer of previously invisible or minor issues then becomes the main issues that we need to address in the next iteration. With each version, the models do get better. Itʻs also true that weʻll always have more ways we can improve each model.

Whatʻs been fascinating is we seem to have discovered a balancing line between coherence and creativity. With these last model improvements (both Dragon J2 and Griffin 2.1) we made significant gains in coherence, but some players have reported the AI being bland or repetitive. So, that has begged the question of whether thereʻs a happy medium? Or is this an indication of diverse player preference and this isnʻt necessarily a model quality issue? 

Right now, our sense is that player preference is having a bigger impact than model quality. From our evaluations and player feedback, it seems the models have become quite coherent, but now we need better ways for players to have the model behave the way THEY want. For instance, some players do want more randomness and creativity from the models. Others have expressed the models are a bit too prone for adventure/fantasy stories and they want to do modern slice of life. This is all feedback weʻve seen here on Reddit and in support and Discord. 

We have a few things coming that we hope will address this. One is exposing the ChatGPT instructions so players can direct that model in the direction of their choosing. For Dragon, we think it might be useful to create separate versions with different datasets tuned to different play styles so players have more choices. Models are sort of like ice cream flavors. There really isnʻt a ""best"" model, but rather lots of good models with different tendencies and behaviors that suit different players. Some people like vanilla bean. Other people like rocky road. Itʻd be great if we could offer more flavors.

We may do something similar with Griffin as well. For Griffin, weʻve also discussed testing a different default temperature setting since it may be too far on the coherent side now and not enough on the creative, especially since free players donʻt have access to the advanced settings. 

Weʻre also testing new models. GPT-4 Turbo and Mistral are at the top of the list. With Mistral, we probably have flexibility to do more ice cream flavors, similar to what we want to try with Dragon and Griffin. We may also explore some Llama models as well. 

One thing that has been missing is smaller, more incremental updates. Weʻve had the team focused on Phoenix and Heroes and weʻve been focused on some of these bigger AI changes like new models. We plan to get back to trying small improvements along the way as well.

New line support is one of the most deceptively complex issues with LLMs. Weʻve spent a lot of time on this, and it hasnʻt gotten better yet. 

There are two main reasons for that. The first is we support models from 3 different sources: Azure, AI21, and then GPT-J which is open source. They each handle new lines differently. We havenʻt found a way to support a consistent use of new lines across all of these different models, but weʻre still trying. This is only going to become harder when we add additional models to our lineup.

The second reasons is some models are really weird about new lines. ChatGPT in particular, is problematic. Iʻm not the technical one on the team, so I canʻt articular the particulars of why, I just know ChatGPT doesnʻt even use new lines consistently, or process them correctly.

The TL;DR is we want new lines to be better, but itʻs surprisingly difficult and weʻre still working on it.","False","False","False","None","None","None","None","0","1701281993.0","2023-11-29-191953","1701281993.0","None","0","False","0","kbakhte","False","None","t3_186jem3","False","None","None","None","[]","t1_kbakhte","True","0","t3_186jem3","/r/AIDungeon/comments/186jem3/generation_not_creating_new_line_with_new_dialogue/kbakhte/","None","","[]","1701282009","False","2","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","1701282024","2","[]","","","",""

>Use 3 Sin Stingers

Sin Stinger 2
(Strength -3):
critical failure
Sin Stinger 3
(Strength -3):
failure
The first Sin Stinger strikes true, digging into the Corrupted Sand Elemental's form and causing it to shudder violently. The second Sin Stinger, carrying much force, snaps mid-thrust due to a critical failure and backlashes at you, inflicting deep cuts and significant damage. The third Sin Stinger fails to connect, leaving you open to retaliation and visibly fatigued from the attempts. The growing fire caused by the campfire catches onto another tent, further escalating the danger. The Corrupted Sand Elemental charges through the sandstorm to reach you, sensing your vulnerability. It takes a fierce swipe at you with its sword. You try to shove the Corrupted Sand Elemental into the growing fire, hoping to use the flames to your advantage. You yell out, 'Turn this sand beast into glass with the flames!' But the Corrupted Sand Elemental seizes the chance to strike you while you are reeling from the backlash of your failings. It brings down a massive sand hammer towards you with the intention to crush you. In a desperate move, you take a fierce swipe at the Corrupted Sand Elemental with your cutlass. You yell out, 'We need to put out that fire before it spreads!' and attempt to put out the growing fire with a nearby bucket of water. As you look around for any other potential dangers, the Corrupted Sand Elemental attempts to absorb more sand to repair itself. It brings down a massive sand hammer towards you once again, with the intention to crush you.

hit by Sin Stinger: lost -9 HP

hit by backlash from Sin Stinger: lost -20 HP

fatigue from failed Sin Stinger attempts: lost -15 HP

caught in growing fire: lost -7 HP

hit by sword swipe: lost -9 HP

hit by sand hammer: lost -40 HP

This probably just means, that you are near the end of mere paramter tuning yielding any improvements. You now need to improve the model itself or the training data you feed it to enable further advancements.

The three most obvious improvement avenues are:

* An increase of context size to allow for moar background and less dementia (the AI forgetting what happened before still is pretty unimmersive).
* Architectural improvements in the model topology or training method (generally hard but might actually yield you the Nobel price and the proving or disproving of Roko's Basilisk if you get real lucky or unlucky).

Each model we support has different tolerances for what can be generated, with ChatGPT being the most conservative and Dragon and Griffin being more open.

Even occasionally having the character think to themselves about the nature of their lie can help?

With the new story cards, you may be able to add context for what that character believes (I've basically only used story cards for character info in custom games. It works well, if you set your trigger words correctly.) Although then sometimes the ai will have a character just randomly go like. ""So let's talk about this belief that I have.""
