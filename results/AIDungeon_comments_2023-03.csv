There's the remember function (the pin icon) where you can put information that you want the AI to remember for the time being. (Judging by your other comments, I believe that is what you had trouble with?) There's also the Author's note, where you can give the AI pointers on the tone and writing style, if you're going for a specific one.

That should give it a general idea, but since it's artificial intelligence, it'll still occasionally go in its own, but you can always dial it back and tell it what you actually wanted. Over time, there'll probably be improvements.

I hear you can also make characters in the world info, I haven't tried that, but some seem to have luck with that.  
The AI likes to latch onto things, and patterns, sometimes you have to wrangle it a bit, to keep it on track.  
Like it might get stuck saying the same thing, the same thing, the same thing.  
When it does as above, it is best to go back and nip that section, or do your best to continue writing more elaborate things to replaces those memories.  
Sometimes if the AI gets stuck, using the story command can be useful, some people don't like using that and wish to give the AI more free reign, it can be surprising and very entertaining, sometimes shocking and horrifying/mortifying.  
You can make use of notes, in the section starting with: You are (Character name here, a (whatever you want to be) while avoiding negatives, and you can also give some brief descriptions or outlines on what you look like, or who you're traveling with, you'll be surprised how quickly you use up the AI's memory with that fun fluffy stuff.  
Then there is the section under that, notes (or whatever it's called my brain is being difficult at the moment), things the AI will check before the top list, it has less characters allowed, letters and such, but seems to have a higher value.  
You can instruct it to be gritty, descriptive, fantasy/apocalyptic, humorous, or whatever other descriptor you can think of, and the AI will try to be more strict with those limitations, reminder, do not use negatives as the AI will try to include those as positives, it's just a little jank with how it understands things.  


Back to the thing you actually asked about, sometimes it's fun to just roll with whatever the AI says, but if you think about using the story function to nudge a character, or event along, say, such and such character is thinking about, or you try to do something rather than proclaiming success/victory, which is fine, can spice things up.  
You're acting as a sort of director, writer, when you use that option, the more detailed you write, the more powerful, concise words you use, will also be useful, as it will try to stick with that.  
The AI doesn't learn from the inputs you, well, input, it just tries to adhere to them with it's predictive text algorithm.  
Sometimes it is spot on, sometimes it really does miss the mark by quite a lot.  
Things such as, 'You notice that the drink is poisoned' the AI then deciding for you on the same output that 'You decide to then drink the poison, you die.', outputs like that are not uncommon, but that's just part of how this thing goes, as you did above, you can just undo up to whatever point, and retry for something more sane, or leave it as is if you wish to try something else.  
I tend to play this game as a fever dream simulator, sometimes faintly grounded, some nsfw, some sfw.  
Telling the AI to be descriptive using the side bar notes can lead to some very nice exchanges.  
Sometimes you have to lead it away from the nsfw if you have the info there and the AI is just doing what you told it to do.  
If you have any more specific questions, I'll do my best to respond, and maybe research it if necessary.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2023-03-02-003509","1677713709","None","False","0","jajyh0m","False","t3_11fbcfi","False","t1_jajyh0m","True","t1_jajdbsj","/r/AIDungeon/comments/11fbcfi/attempted_to_jokingly_scare_my_girl_from_behind/jajyh0m/","1681312024","2","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None"

Unless you directly touch either of the authors notes, it doesn't change the info inside of the memory, using the story, or editing the text, essentially (from my understanding) treats it as if the AI had typed it itself, and then it will continue on from where the edit has left off, be mindful of leaving extra spaces when editing the text, as it can put off the alignment and make the text look a bit off, in other words, once you've snipped or edited, be sure to backspace until you get the letters nice and tidy, if that sort of things bothers you.  
It may not.  
The AI's memory in this instance is whatever the amount of characters that it is limited to, letter wise, and I don't remember what that is exactly, but it is different for different versions.  
If I understood correctly, you adjusting the text by a huge amount could possibly adjust the memory by using more characters, pushing it closer to the limit.  
Small adjustments shouldn't really be noticeable from my experience.

I’m a dev with some familiarity with machine learning, and I'm currently working on a new project at the crossroads of AI and gaming.

The goal is to offer more immersive gameplay by leveraging deep learning models for Natural Language Understanding and 3D motion generation

I would be thrilled to get your feedback on it!

Or could an AI differentiate between different objects, such as a fist and head? So that it would understand “I punched him in the head”.

\\- I'd say that it's technically possible to populate a 3d scene with 3d assets, from a simple text input, but there are several ways to implement this. This would amount to running a model similar to [stable diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion), but in 3D.

\\- As for differentiating between different objects for real, that's an active field of research called ""grounded language learning"". To put it shortly, scientists haven't completely cracked that nut yet ;) A lot of people argue that transformers, the building block behind dall-e 2 and GPT, are fundamentally unable to reason and do logic.

During 2021, OpenAI started enforcing their [new content policy](https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies/disallowed-usage), which disallowed... well, a variety of things. This also resulted in less users using the OpenAI models due to OpenAI's censorship, causing Latitude (the company behind AID) to lose the volume-based discount they once had on OpenAI's models. Latitude ended up ditching OpenAI.

AI Dungeon now uses Jurassic-1 models from AI21, with Dragon using Jurassic-1 Jumbo. However, the current version of Dragon simply doesn't perform as well as the OpenAI one. In fact, Latitude, themselves, actually says that Wyvern-Hydra is the best model on AID at the moment. Additionally, a lot of AI applications have released in the past year or two with some being arguably better than AI Dungeon; a lot of the complaints regarding AI Dungeon in the past year or so are due to some users simply feeling that current AID is worse than the alternatives.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2023-03-06-001332","1678058012","None","False","0","jb2kmx6","False","t3_11j8hp3","False","t1_jb2kmx6","True","t3_11j8hp3","/r/AIDungeon/comments/11j8hp3/should_i_buy_dragon/jb2kmx6/","1681291428","6","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None",""

AIDungeon can be finicky.

Way back when I ran my first serious go at a long term fantasy adventure (premade world), the NPCs ended up being so amorous towards a nice main character that I ended up accidentally acquiring a harem of female cohorts/lovers and an archdemon ended up being friends and occasionally interceding on my behalf. Then censorgeddon happened and it completely broke that scenario, and I eventually deleted it.

Now it's at a much more balanced point, not overly inappropriate and not pg censored either.

It took some time, but I have some ""adventures"" as in instances of scenarios which have usable to decent responses.

Beginning of rant

That being said, the quality of initial responses and until the ai somehow gets the tone right are devastating. I have recently tried some scenarios. Some I picked from the popular ones and some I started my self and I just can't get to that point anymore. After the first few tries I have died so many times inside that I just can't continue.

End of rant

To the point of being a scam. I don't think it is intended as such but I feel that who ever is developing this is in way over their head. The website is a pain to use.

Beginning of rant

The worlds from which you can choose are convoluted and alien and at this point quite old. The scenarios are all horny teenager stuff. Setting up your own stuff is a nightmare.
There are other AI products which are marketed together with AI dungeon and to me they all feel more like a tech demo.
The not so recent discussion about advertisment and pricing was annoying and the dev team in the end invalidated their arguments by releasing the steam version as pay once package.

End of rant

All in all you can make it work, but it is a pain. I think it can be worth it to try to get to the point when the AI starts responding with some what coherent stuff. 
It is a interesting experience to get continues suggestions for how a story might evolve.

More text I guess...

The problems the devs are facing are actually quite difficult ones, with the ai being a black box algorithm, expensive models, expensive training and running the model is also not free. Issues of questionable content which is fed into the ai from which it might learn. Community communication if you are a techy, marketing and product design and so on.

This is what I'm using so far, but honestly it doesn't seem worth to try. It's been months since I've had a decent generation, that doesn't just look like some generic super model. 3k+ credits down the drain and nothing cool to show for it. 
If you have a decent image you can't even do anything with it. 

Just not worth using rn, especially since novel ai has such a great image generation. Took me two minutes with the free trial to make a really good character. And i can modify the image, or spend more credits to make initial image look better. 

Although i hope ai dungeon won't just drop it's text ai like Novel ai has. And it seems like they won't.

I feel it is related to the memory. At the beginning, they are better because the memory is 100% user input. But as the story progresses, more of that comes from the AI. So the better the AI responses, the less degradation.

Without consistent editing, it devolves into repetitive subjects and sentence structure. 

With Wyvern, I have to do more frequent editing to avoid the degradation.

Novel AI nor AI dungeon can describe an NPC or a location or a scene better than Chat GPT. Not even close.

Chat GPT is not going to do anything close to NSFW. So it's useless for that. But I'll give you an example of what I'm talking about how I use it.

My prompt: I'm writing a story that takes place in Medieval times. I'm writing it in limited third person and in present tense. I'm exploring a cave and ahead of me I hear a sound. There's an ominous tone to the scene and there's about to be Danger. What is the danger?

ChatGPT: As the protagonist cautiously ventures deeper into the cave, the sound grows louder and more unsettling, echoing off the damp, stony walls. The air, heavy with moisture and the scent of decay, sends a shiver down their spine. The darkness seems to close in around them, amplifying their every breath and heartbeat.

The source of the sound soon comes into view: a massive, serpentine creature with gleaming, obsidian scales slithers through the shadows. Its blood-red eyes pierce the darkness, locking onto the protagonist with predatory intent. A low, guttural hiss escapes from the beast, revealing rows of razor-sharp teeth that glint menacingly in the faint light.

The creature, known in legends as the Cavern Serpent, is said to be a guardian of ancient treasures buried deep within the earth. It is swift, relentless, and nearly impossible to defeat. As it rears up, preparing to strike, the protagonist must quickly decide whether to confront the beast or attempt a daring escape. The atmosphere thick with tension, it becomes clear that the danger they face is both very real and incredibly deadly.

Now I could have gave it my name and any other things I wanted it to know about the scene. But neither AI dungeon or novel AI would have created that on the fly.

Describe the stranger, what race he is using d&amp;d races, his name, and other details including why he ended up in the cave.

ChatGPT: The stranger, covered in a light layer of dust and grime, stands tall and imposing as he emerges from the shadows. He is a half-orc, a fusion of human resilience and orcish strength, with distinctive greenish-gray skin and prominent tusks jutting from his lower jaw. His muscular build is accentuated by the leather armor hugging his torso, adorned with various animal bones and symbols etched into the material.

His name is Grommash Thundershield, a seasoned warrior and treasure hunter who has made a name for himself throughout the realm. His dark, intense eyes hold an air of mystery and danger, while a deep scar runs from his forehead down to the left side of his face, a testament to the battles he has fought.

Grommash had come to the cave following an ancient map that hinted at a long-forgotten treasure guarded by the Cavern Serpent. Knowing full well the risks, he had prepared himself for the encounter, honing his skills with his trusty double-bladed ax and studying the serpent's weaknesses.

When he saw the protagonist in mortal danger, Grommash wasted no time in coming to their aid. With a fierce battle cry, he charged at the creature, his powerful muscles propelling him forward. In a single, fluid motion, he swung his ax and cleaved the serpent's head from its massive body, sending it tumbling to the ground with a sickening thud. The monstrous creature's lifeless form collapsed, convulsing briefly before lying still in the dim light of the cave.

As the initial shock of the encounter begins to fade, Grommash steps forward, offering a hand to help the protagonist to their feet. Despite his intimidating appearance, his voice is surprisingly gentle as he speaks. ""Are you all right?"" he asks, genuine concern evident in his tone.

The protagonist, still shaken but grateful for the timely intervention, nods their head. Grommash introduces himself and shares his reason for venturing into the cave. Intrigued by the prospect of hidden treasure and eager to repay Grommash for saving their life, the protagonist offers to join him in the search.

Together, they delve deeper into the cave, their bond forged by a common purpose and the shared experience of narrowly escaping death. As they face the many challenges and mysteries hidden within the cave, Grommash and the protagonist discover that they make a formidable team, their unique skills and backgrounds complementing one another perfectly.

I used it for a digital garden in combination with markdown and Jekyll. (Turns markdown into a fully-functioning website that links between pages automatically.)

You can add to generated text at any point. I found it great for humorous stuff. You can generate up to 10 responses from a single prompt, choose the one you like, and then it feeds back in the thread that you're working on into the context so you can continue one long piece. Very unique way of writing. Also lets you switch back to other threads if the one you're working on isn't panning out. You *can* use it to just have it generate everything itself, but I don't think that's the intent. Try adding to responses to steer it in the direction you want. You can also erase any part of what it generates.

I recommend playing around with it a bit to figure out what's going on.

This was generated: She is petite and very attractive, with long legs and beautiful long hair. She is a young woman, who wears the standard school uniform.
She wears her hair in two long pigtails.
