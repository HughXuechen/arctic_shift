This isn't an issue anymore.

You use World Info and for the Type, enter ""Character"". Then in the ""Entry"" box, write out your character description. Then add keys to the ""keys"" box so it gets triggered. Ex: ""Sam Smith, Man, Knight, Heroic"".

Here is a template example that I have had good luck with so far... 

I try to keep things condensed as possible and inside brackets. I have tried no brackets but the AI regurgitates stuff back literally as written... In memory or in in the character tab. Keeping it condensed saves tokens and allows the AI freedom which personally I enjoy...

To save you time... I have tried overly descriptive characters and personalities, I have found getting their Behavior into the ballpark with a max of 5 descriptive personality words gives the AI enough room to play and at least gives me a good results.

If you want them to have more purpose in the story, the Queen is my example of how I influence it.

"[]","None","None","False","None","latitude_official","None","None","[]","None","None","None","text","t2_ugspbkxi","False","False","False","[]","None","None","Yep! Here’s a slightly more detailed explanation that might help. (For any AI nerds out there, I realize this is a simplification, feel free to add more details if you’d like). 

Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on massive datasets (basically any publicly available text available) and analyzed in a way that makes them exceptionally good at generating text. So your hometown’s name is likely somewhere buried in that massive data set. However, that data set is actually pretty static. You may have seen people talking about how ChatGPT’s “knowledge” ends in 2021, which is when they stopped collecting data and started training the model. 

When you play AI Dungeon (or even use LLMs elsewhere, like ChatGPT) the text you send to the AI isn’t being added to the training dataset. It’s simply a set of instructions the AI uses to generate more text. Your text (the prompt) is more like short term memory. Every time the AI generates a new step of your story, we are sending your latest prompt, as well as anything you have stored in Authors Notes, the Memory field, as well as many previous steps of your story. We have to re-send all of that information every time you generate a new part of your story because none of it is being “stored by the AI”. 

Your prompt, the story, and memory and authors notes all get combined into a single set of instructions. This instruction set is limited to a certain amount of tokens (think of tokens as representations of words or phrases). The AI can only process a limited number of tokens. This limit is called the context size. The AI analyzes the tokens sent and generates a response, but it isn’t storing the instructions you sent, and it certainly isn’t “learning” from the instructions you sent. To do that, the LLM provider would have to collect all of the inputs sent to it and then retrain the model (which is a time consuming process, not something that can be done on the fly). 

So, the only information the AI sees at any given moment is what is being sent in your context. We actually have a feature that allows you to “inspect the input” so you can see everything we’re sending to the AI. You’d be able to verify that there is no personal information being sent to the AI at any given time unless you explicitly choose to include it in your story. Additionally, the AI isn’t learning about you over time or inferring things about you, it simply cannot retain information in that way. 

Hope that helps.

Here’s a history lesson:

>leaks of personal data

Did happen, two years ago, and at the time they handled it poorly. However, they also plugged that leak and as far as I’m aware it hasn’t happened since.

>massive AI downgrades

Inevitable since they cut ties with OpenAI in response to most of the rest of these problems, many of which occurred at the behest of that company. Detractors don’t like to make that distinction, but it’s important to recognize that OpenAI had Latitude in a bind when the worst of this was going on, since they were dependent upon OpenAI for service. Switching to other providers fixed a lot of this, but it also forced a downgrade in quality since the competition doesn’t have OpenAI’s funding.

>horrendous censoring of the AI's which caused bans and restricted freedom heavily

This is the biggest part that OpenAI had their fingers in. They demanded for Latitude to police their users, and at the time the only alternative to compliance would have been to let the product die. The AI is still lightly censored to curtail severely objectionable content (targeting rape, pedophilia, and bestiality, primarily), but the current filter has a much lighter touch than the one OpenAI had forced upon them. The practice of banning users also ended years ago, so unless they revise their policy again it isn’t a concern now.

>hardly ever communicating back when it had fans

This one definitely needs some context. When the worst of this all went down there was a period where every statement of Latitude’s was twisted out of context to suit a critical narrative (many complaints were valid, but things got seriously out of hand, up to and including death threats being made against the devs) and all of their posts were downvoted to the Shadow Realm. People then expressed even more shock and outrage when Latitude did the logical thing and stopped posting until after the fervor died down.","True","False","False","None","None","None","None","0","1688955531.0","2023-07-10-041851","1688955531.0","None","0","False","0","jrcr948","False","None","t3_14t14qf","False","None","None","None","[]","t1_jrcr948","True","0","t1_jr5u8y4","/r/AIDungeon/comments/14t14qf/its_my_first_time_using_the_app_any_basic_tips_i/jrcr948/","None","","[]","1688955562","False","1","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","1689785058","1","[]",""

It’s great to see someone else working with AID on longer form storytelling. Most of what I’ve done with AI Dungeon has been a single adventure that expanded out to novel length and then spilled over into a second book; I’ve been basically co-writing with the AI using only /story prompts, reloading aggressively and loading it up with massive memory details in an effort to steer it in the vague direction of long-term comprehensibility. It’s been an interesting exercise in finding out the limits of the tool.
