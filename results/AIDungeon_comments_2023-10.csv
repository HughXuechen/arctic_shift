Grammar and punctuation is good, and any errors weren't bad enough to take me out of it (Noticed an improvement by the end part). I was taken off guard by the smut, but I can't really hold it against you since we AI Dungeon users have a thing for getting into long and deep adventures based on initial smut and fantasies. 

By the way, what AI are you using? It strikes me as Chat GPT but you got away with a lot of NSFW shit.

I like the MC, I appreciate main characters that aren't passive, or have a corrupt edge to them. Too many MCs are just along for the ride as shit happens to them. 

This gave me a very wholesome sense of nostalgia despite the contents of it being anything but. It reminded me of all the fun experiences of working with AI for the first time and being able to express your imagination. Like when Lilith makes her first base. It was a great time. Dumb fun stuff like that is the best part imo.

Yeah it do be blurring the lines between a novel and a hot story, I wanted to depict the character as wildly as I imagined her to be. A demon after all, and a powerful vampire.
Ai first I was pretty janky learning the controls for the AI, but then things took off and it just became alive.

This story led me to dream about creating a true Masquerade world, but I'm struggling with the prompts and coding for the world building, still haven't figured out how to make a decent character sheet but I'll work on it and post updates.

Thanks again for the invite into the discord, I'll check it out better latter and update the story.

As for the ai I'm using, it's the standard Griffin v2. 1 of AI Dungeon with the mature filters turned off ;)","False","False","False","None","None","None","None","0","1696471143.0","2023-10-05-035903","1696471143.0","None","0","False","0","k3ipi27","True","None","t3_16uhkem","False","None","None","None","[]","t1_k3ipi27","True","0","t1_k3i1wgf","/r/AIDungeon/comments/16uhkem/just_released_a_vampire_the_masquerade_scenario/k3ipi27/","None","","[]","1696471157","False","1","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","1696471174","1","[]"

Though, if I remember correctly, at the time you were posting topic after topic with your generations so frequently it looked like a grasp for attention. (I.E. Here's a generation. Here's another generation. Here's another.) With the topic/description being super short. Was it hourly? Daily? Being **2 years old**, I can't even say what the deal/issue was at the time anymore.

Judging from what I was replying to, maybe it was that you posted barely anything in the description of the posts? Making it look like you posted a nothing-burger of a story. And I was getting frustrated that when I checked your posts at the time, it was just a few lines of generation. ""Oh look! New story!... And there's only 2 lines of generation >:(""  
Maybe it was that you posted 1 piece of the story every few hours as a new topic rather than just amending your previous topic's description? Cause if you had only posted 1 story (as your comment history suggests) then I wouldn't have been frustrated, cause it would have happened only once. Maybe it was that you kept making the the same story topic, deleting it, and then re-posting it? That would make sense for you to have 1 story topic in this subreddit (according to your comments) and me getting frustrated over you posting the same thing 3 times in a row.

Again, **this was 2 years ago**, I don't have a clue what was happening anymore. Maybe if I had held a grudge, ***as it seems you have***, maybe I would have cared to remember.

Its nearest competitor, which spawned from the shitshow of the end of the golden age, NovelAI, doesn't have that adventure feel. The AI is somewhat better but not as broadly knowledgeable. 

Them there's the myriad of significantly lesser alternatives, such as Kobold, et. al.  I've dabbled with a few, but they've all been so lackluster. 

If you just want to chat with characters, then Character.AI is a thing, but doesn't do NSFW content. It's also out of its golden age, which was just under a year ago. Since then, they've persistently neutered and lobotomised their AI to block any and all NSFW.

Have you checked on the web version? https://legacy.aidungeon.com Or in Phoenix? https://play.aidungeon.com

Also, be aware that Phoenix has already replaced Legacy as the primary environment on the web, and mobile apps will be migrated soon. I suggest playing in Phoenix via mobile web, or enrolling in the app beta, so you can get used to the new experience. If you run into any specific bugs or UI issues with either of those, Discord is the best way to report them.

More info on switching to the Phoenix version of the mobile app is here. https://help.aidungeon.com/phoenix-mobile-apps","False","False","False","None","None","None","None","0","1697475177.0","2023-10-16-185257","1697475177.0","None","0","False","0","k54y4jb","False","None","t3_1792hph","False","None","None","None","[]","t1_k54y4jb","True","0","t1_k54x8k8","/r/AIDungeon/comments/1792hph/so_why_are_all_my_avatars_missing/k54y4jb/","None","","[]","1697475191","False","1","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","1697475207","1","[]"

So with the heroes system, I noticed that you mentioned it's going to be sort of an open world. What I want to know is whether or not you'd be able to play the same exact scenario more than once with completely different outcomes and different quests, etc ?

I'm asking because you talked about putting up specific obstacles and assigning quests. It sounds sort of linear and I'm wondering if that's the case.

I mean of course you could make different choices the next time you play and have a different game, but I'm wondering if the AI is basically going to make up things as it goes along so that it's a different story every time.

With AI I would think that eventually, it would make up completely different characters, different locations, different quests, etc each time you play through creating a dynamic world that's never the same twice.","False","False","False","None","None","None","None","0","1697591436.0","2023-10-18-031036","1697591436.0","None","0","False","0","k5cb1im","False","None","t3_17acm41","False","None","None","None","[]","t1_k5cb1im","True","0","t3_17acm41","/r/AIDungeon/comments/17acm41/next_major_ai_dungeon_update_with_inventory/k5cb1im/","None","","[]","1697591449","False","1","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","1697591466","1","[]",""

For the side-scroll buttons, we’ve heard this from others and we’re considering an option to make the buttons icons only. For experienced players who don’t need the text labels, that would make it so all the buttons fit on the mobile view without scrolling. Thoughts on that idea?

We removed the “…” menu because all the actions were moved to other locations. To delete a section, you can simply delete the text in a section and it will be removed. We replaced “Undo to Here” with “Erase to here” and you can read about the ways to use that on our guidebook article: https://help.aidungeon.com/faq/what-is-erase-to-here.

I think this might be the first time I’ve seen feedback on the page view vs long scroll for reading adventures. How do you find you use the page view most? Do you use it mostly to jump to the top or bottom? Or are you trying to find specific sections in the middle?

Yes, maintaining two UI’s is a pain. We’re excited to get to one, and we want to address as much player feedback as possible before we retire Legacy. Input like this helps tremendously.

Yes but you either need to find a scenario or World that someone has made or make it yourself. Pretty much any world you can imagine can be played in AI Dungeon.

Yes. They're called Adventures and each one has all the data from that session. You can keep them going for as long as you want.

>Can you build relationships with characters such that they remember you?

Yes, though it doesn't do it for you. You have to use Story Cards or the Memory box.

>How does multiplayer work? Can anyone say anything at any point?

Solid. It works on the output end, so the Ai will avoid any NSFW or banned actions itself.

I have scenarios that are frequently revisit. The AI was always quite competent. But then one day the AI just suddenly started acting like a s***** chat bot. And I'm not just talking about it being bad with the subject I mean all around it was worse. It started using extremely simplified responses to everything. And it forgot a lot of concepts that it used to be good at recognizing. This happened across the board on all my scenarios. And I have reason to believe it was because I canceled my dragon subscription. Because I decided to try dragon for the more advanced scenarios but ended up deciding against using it shortly after. And mysteriously as soon as I canceled and tried to go back to the Griffin AI it started giving out s***** responses to even the simplest of generic vanilla scenarios. Keep in mind I had used this Griffin AI just the day before I decided to try dragon. So this isn't a case of ""oh you just haven't used it for a long time and you didn't realize how bad it was at certain things"". Since then I have not been able to get a decent response from any of the scenarios. The AI now constantly tries to speak for the player and uses simple text responses with no action descriptors. Before the AI very rarely tried to speak for the player and would almost always describe some sort of action with every prompt. The difference is night and day when you experience the change so suddenly.

AI dungeon is a text focused experience, like a WhatsApp conversation or editing a document. I like to interact with it primarily by typing text. 

Phoenix is a cluttered mess of extraneous UI elements that force me to interact with them just to take a turn. This is particularly horrendous on mobile because of the limited screen space. 

Things are not much better on desktop. It’s text, I have a keyboard, I want to type. Instead I have to reach for the mouse every time to click a useless button.

Did you even notice you replied to a post from a year ago? Also, jeez, it's almost 2024 and you're still using Griffin.... Really? AID has been +-stagnating for about 2 years now, or even more. There have been ways to run AI models that will be noticeably better than Griffin and even Wyvern, for quite some time. You can even run better models locally if you have a videocard with 12-16gb+ of VRAM.  
As for your blah.... I'm really tired of discussing things with both AID fans and the opposite side.   
Here's a simple question. Do you even know how AI text generators function? Or, do you have a methodology for testing AI models(in AID)? Have you been following the release of new versions of the models, and/or comparing/testing them face to face on absolutely identical text with multiple 20+ Retries with the same settings?  
I've done all that many times, and at the time I was answering the person's question (a year+ ago), the Griffin model hadn't changed for quite some time... As for the difference between the paid and free version (back there) - it was only in access to AI settings and memory size (1024t vs 2048t). But, on default settings and short scenarios they behaved IDENTICALLY.

What I want to say is that you have to use at least a simple testing methodology to claim something, otherwise it will just be your feelings.  


p.s. I don't know how AID works now, and have almost no interest in it. Occasionally I pop into this thread to read about updates, then facepalm and leave. The last time I did a little comparison between the Griffin and a few 7b models was about 3 months ago.

You didn't seem negative at all. There are many new changes, and we appreciate that you see the potential here. We're working hard to make sure it's a 10/10 before we retire Legacy.[io/blog/features-for-phoenix](https://latitude.io/blog/features-for-phoenix).   


Legacy is available at [legacy.aidungeon.io](https://legacy.aidungeon.io). Our team is very small, so maintaining Legacy (especially with all of its issues) isn't feasible. We would love to get more feedback so we can improve Phoenix to the point no one misses Legacy.   


For characters, you can add Characters as a Story Card. Simply create a custom category for Story Cards called ""Characters"" and create away!

We've done a LOT of testing, both internally and with Alpha and Beta testers. We didn't have as many people testing the native apps as we would have liked, so we're doing a slow rollout of the app so we can fix as many bugs as we can before releasing it to everyone.

There are some major bugs, of course, but there's no reason for those not to be fixed, and large bugs are to be expected after such a huge update.

Even the smallest (currently) available text size is nearly twice as large as the size I was using on Legacy, and I'm sure I'm not the only one who was using tiny text. The color I'm a lot less attached to, though it would certainly be nice to have! I was using the darkest dark mode, which hides the clock on IOS for some reason, which helped a lot with immersion.

- Images—We’re working on a solution to make images more relevant. Right now, the plan is to provide the ability for creators to add custom images, but we’ll see for sure once we’ve fully explored possible solutions. Along with this, we’re working on some mobile views that will feature smaller (or no) images to allow for a more condensed viewing experience. We’ve already released one version of this to Beta (discover and profile pages are impacted)
- Game icons—They do take up more space, and this is understandably a pain point for experienced users. The issue we’re addressing here is making it easier for new players to learn. Continue, for instance, was completely invisible and impossible to learn without someone telling you. We’ve seen much better success rates with new players learning. That said, we’re exploring an “Icon mode” so that experienced players can disable the text labels and have a much more condensed view.

I’m not sure I understand the issue you’re having accessing older adventures. How did you get to them before? What’s different about it now? My understanding is we didn’t make many changes there so I am wondering if you’ve found another issue.

I’d be happy to elaborate on any changes you have questions on. The one you mentioned, “take a turn”, I can certainly share some background on. 

We’ve saw over and over in user testing that new players struggled to understand the ways they could interact with the AI in Legacy. We also saw this in our analytics data as well. Certain actions (like “Continue”) were completely invisible. Players also didn’t realize there were other options besides “Do”. We tested some different interactions to see whether we could make AI Dungeon more intuitive, and the version in Phoenix has performed much better in both user testing and our analytics. We were careful not to make the interaction more cumbersome for experienced players. All actions are still the same number of clicks, or less, to complete. We also implemented a “Sticky Mode” option that many of our experienced players like (have you tried this one yet? What do you think?). One additional enhancement we’re exploring right now is an “Icon Mode” so that the action buttons will be icons only, losing the text labels, and be more consolidated. We’d love to hear any other changes we could make to improve the experience. 

If there are any other changes you’d like to know more about, I’d be happy to answer them.

Can you elaborate a bit more on what you mean about highlighting on read mode? What platform are you on? 

We have several changes coming that will improve the experiences with images. We're going to be introducing more compact views that reduce or remove the images. We're also working on ways to make the images more relevant. The current plan is to enable custom images for creators so they have full control over the images, which would make them more relevant and interesting.

Do you think those changes will help?

I'm part of our design team and would be happy to answer any questions. We discussed many of our objectives with the new design in our beta announcement earlier this year: [https://latitude.io/blog/phoenix-beta-release-product-updates](https://latitude.io/blog/phoenix-beta-release-product-updates)

Was anyone asking for this? Yes. Our Legacy UI had accumulated so much tech debt we weren't able to easily add new features players were asking for. There were also lots of bugs and stability issues as well. New players, in particular, found AI Dungeon difficult to learn and figure out. For instance, players didn't realize there were different modes (Do/Say/Story), or that there was a ""Continue"" action. We're seeing much better success with the new design, and we have even more improvements in mind. If there are any particular decisions you'd like me to elaborate on, I'd be happy to.

For the images, we've heard that feedback and we have several changes coming in the next few weeks. You can read about them here: [https://latitude.io/blog/features-for-phoenix](https://latitude.io/blog/features-for-phoenix).
