Placing his hand on the sphere his mind is partially transported to the Void....
Pure silence, darkness and nothingness fills his senes. 


Looking around he tries to sense beyond his usual bubble of personel space. The darkness swallows the waves of faster than light energy for sensing completly after only a few miles. 


Blaze shudders. ""Alot more demons and things stuck here than I remember."" He thinks to himself.


Suddenly a burst of energy registers, moving to avoid it he is to late as it hits his astral shoulder causing immense pain. 


He turns around towards where the attack came from and is met with an hand grabbing his throat.


""It never seems to be good enough. We struggle more now than when we were demons."" His wife says.


 Suddenly she produces a silver blade and Blaze's eyes widen... As she strikes he is ripped back to his body just before the angel blade can connect fully. 


There's a surge of energy from the crystal and Blaze is thrown into the far wall causing it to collapse...


....


....


Blaze pushes himself up in bed the next day. 


Holding his chest he can feel where the metaphysical blade began cutting into his physical form from the within the Void.


Blaze gasps as tears begin to form in his eyes...

 

The next day...
In a radiation suit, Blaze stands in the middle of the forest near the crater that the mushroom cloud from the explosion was located at.


""If this wasn't part of the anomaly then we have a problem. I assumed it was primitive black market uranium. I was wrong and it was a 50 megaton device that looks like a ball of uranium."" He says to Ruby.


She frowns. ""What about mom?"" She asks.


Blaze looks down into the crater. ""I... I don't know what to do about that. She tried to kill me with an angel blade."" 


Ruby shakes her head. ""I can't believe she would do that. I know she was angry at you, but I can't believe she would do something like that.""


""I know.""he says as he cries behind his face shield.


Looking up he sees the dragon surveyors from the kingdom of Larion. Waving at them to land a few miles away with the universally known signs, he and Ruby leave the investigation crew to study the scene.


A few miles away the inquirer of the king and his top general are waiting. Blaze uses a spell to store his suit in a dimensional pocket and then approaches them as they step forward.The general steps to Blaze and shakes his hand.


""I can't stay long. I need to take my team and get back to New City and let them know what happened. Our military can help you scout. So far no one is sour over this... but the other kingdoms may not be transparent about it."" 


""I understand... only ones I know of that can make a nuclear weapon so small capable of this. Would be The Syndicate.... Seems to be an accidental detonation. Possibly involved with a missing star fleet light frigate."" He says to the general getting right to the point.


""Well it is a long shot but acceptable for now, and what about the anomaly?""


Blaze's breath catches for a moment. ""It was just a random astroid impact.... No casualties or property damage."" He says.


The inquirer of the king looks at his general. ""I hope you are right.""


The general salutes and the two quickly take off on their dragon to give their report.


Ruby looks at her father. ""Why did you lie about mom and that Evil wizard?"" She asks.


He looks at her. ""Cause I'm not giving up on her yet."" He says.


She looks away from him in a pout.


Blaze reassures her. ""Don't worry, Mihrad obviously isn't to worried about us anymore and still has a few days at the least before the healing is finished. A side effect of the Void Energy."" 


""Yeah."" She says.


He continues. ""I don't think it's the best plan to tell everyone about it.""


Ruby frowns. ""But she could destroy the whole planet..."" 


""Don't tell anyone Ruby... Please. It's much easier that way."" He says.


She sighs and hugs him. ""You know I hate secrets.""


""I know. It's for the best at the moment.""


She walks away from him towards a portal.


Blaze frowns. ""Where are you going?""


Ruby shrugs. ""To my room for awhile.""


Blaze sighs. ""Ok, don't go far just in case anything happens."" He says opening a portal of his own and stepping through into his throne room.","True","False","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","44360","public","None","self","None","None","Shadow-Verse: In to Deep","None","0","[]","1694393144","1","1.0","https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/16fh5qs/shadowverse_in_to_deep/","[]","None","False","None","None","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On Friday last week, we pushed several new features to AI Dungeon, including Story Cards (replacement to World Info), Scenario Character Creator, Adventure Read Screen, and Scripting.

This means that, so far, we‚Äôre on schedule with the Phoenix transition we shared on August 30th. The next step is to transition the Web experience to default to Phoenix for all users. We are planning this transition for Thursday, September 14th. Legacy will still be available at [legacy.aidungeon.com](http://legacy.aidungeon.com/). Going forward, [play.aidungeon.com](http://play.aidungeon.com/) will be the new URL for AI Dungeon. The [play.aidungeon.io](http://play.aidungeon.io/) and [beta.aidungeon.com](http://beta.aidungeon.com/) URLs will both be forwarded there.

We‚Äôre paying close attention to player feedback to make sure any bugs and loose ends are addressed before this transition. As a reminder, we will not move forward until we‚Äôve been able to fix any Priority 1 (P1) and Priority 2 (P2) bugs that have been reported for Phoenix on the Web. We‚Äôll also be capturing any player feedback and addressing any critical feedback before moving forward. Please be sure to share any feedback or bugs in our [bugs Discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/903327676884979802/1065040361057177702) or email us at [support@aidungeon.com](mailto:support@aidungeon.com).

After we successfully transition, the next step will be to transition the native iOS and Android apps to Phoenix. We expect this to happen one to two weeks after the Web transition.

Please be sure to share any feedback with us as we prepare for this transition. Our goal is to make sure this is a smooth transition for our players.

however, I have run into a glitch when inputting an action on Android, Samsung Galaxy M13. the input box goes under the keyboard and I can't input anything. if I try to hide the keyboard to submit my input, the input box goes completely off screen. also, once I manage to submit something, I can't seem to submit it again without having to exit and enter the adventure.

We‚Äôve received a number of questions lately about Worlds, Scenarios, Story Cards, and World Info, and we‚Äôd like to provide some more detail into the changes we‚Äôve made (and others to come).

## Merging Worlds into Scenarios

### Background

Worlds and Scenarios both provide creators with ways to configure an experience for other AI Dungeon players. There‚Äôs always been some overlap in functionality between the two, and players have requested we bring features from one over to the other. As we reviewed the feedback, we realized we could simplify the experience if we combined them.

### Phoenix Scenarios have World tools

Scenarios in Phoenix are the first step in combining the two. If you create a Scenario in Phoenix, you can create Story Cards (the replacement for World Info) and set up a Character Creator (similar to the starting experience from Worlds). In other words, the Phoenix Scenarios allow you to make the equivalent of a World from Legacy.

### World and Scenario Data Merge after Legacy is Retired

Once we‚Äôve fully rolled out Phoenix and retired Legacy, we‚Äôll merge Worlds and Scenarios into a single content type. We can‚Äôt do this until Legacy is retired since Legacy supports editing and creating Worlds. Currently, any World created in Legacy is displayed in Phoenix, where we still show Worlds as separate content types in the UI. Worlds won‚Äôt be editable in Phoenix until we merge the World and Scenario data shortly after retiring Legacy. We encourage content creators to use the Phoenix Scenarios when creating new content going forward to avoid this temporary limitation.

## Story Cards Replace World Info

### Background

World Info is one of the most powerful features players have to help the AI track key story details, character descriptions, and, well, information about their worlds. Since language models like the ones we use in AI Dungeon can only process a limited amount of information (ie context limits), World Info helps players control which information the AI is processing at a given time and improves the consistency of the story.

This is functionality we‚Äôd like more players to be able to take advantage of. The implementation of World Info in Legacy has been complicated and confusing. A few months ago we [shared a concept design](https://discord.com/channels/903327676884979802/1095404196079091792) for a more intuitive World Info experience that would not only be easier for new players to understand but it would also give experienced players more control over the data included in the context. Although we don‚Äôt have immediate plans to implement this concept, it represents our hope of making Story Cards more accessible to the average AI Dungeon player.

The transition to Story Cards is an important first step for improving the player experience and the underlying architecture from World Info.

### Deprecating Shared World Info

The ability for World Info to be shared between content and users is powerful but confusing. It creates a number of challenges, both from technical and design aspects. We asked players for feedback about the idea of retiring the shared World Info library in favor of having World Info be tied to a specific content instance. We expected our creators would reject this proposal, but we were surprised that most were in favor of this change and agreed the shared library created more problems than it was worth.

With Story Cards replacing World Info, Story Card data is now tied to a specific piece of content. When you play a Scenario created by another user, the Story Card data tied to the Scenario gets duplicated for your adventure. This means if you want to make changes to the Story Card, you can. With shared World Info, you would have gotten an error saying you didn‚Äôt have permission to edit (since the World Info originated from the Scenario).

### Import/Export

One capability players told us they‚Äôd miss with shared World Info was the ability to push changes to other players or to share data between different content they create. For instance, some creators use the same characters and settings in different Scenarios, so a way to easily re-use this data is needed.

Because of that, we‚Äôre introducing Import and Export for Story Cards. For any Scenario, you can export the data as a JSON file. You can then import it into a different Scenario or Adventure, and it will replace the existing Story Cards. Some players may also prefer to edit and make changes directly in the JSON file rather than using the AI Dungeon interface.

We anticipate more refinements for the Importing and Exporting process will be needed. Any

You can access the Import and Export feature by navigating to the Settings of an Adventure or Scenario, then click on Details, and scroll to the bottom.

## Please continue to share feedback

There's been a lot of bug fixing in the past week as we prepare for the web transition to Phoenix. Thanks to all of you for testing and sharing feedback.  

We fixed a bug this week that we wanted to highlight. There was a bug in the API guarding that could have enabled someone to add or replace Story Cards on content that wasn't their own using the API. 

Out of an abundance of caution, our developers and exec team gathered immediately to review. It didn't take long for us to fix the bug and determine that no Story Cards were impacted. We've also completed a precautionary review of our API to make sure this was the only bug of the kind.  

We want to give a special thanks to u/ght901 for discovering and reporting this bug.

Our team has been working diligently for a long time to make this happen. We are so grateful to the entire Latitude team for their hard work, patience, and grit. This has been a huge project, and we're so proud of their work. 

We want to say thanks to all of you who have been testing, reporting bugs, and giving feedback. We couldn't have done this without you. 

And remember, we're still gathering feedback and input from all of you about Phoenix. This transition milestone doesn't mean our work is done.

From what I understand, all functions were supposed to be carried over? I even asked and was told that it'll be there... yet the option is missing.

As someone who uses it frequently... I'm pretty disappointed at the moment, and basically only play on the old mobile App where the function is still available, despite the bug notice. Because I honestly don't see the value of the new UI and layout. I use AID for text, for writing stories, trying versions of scenarios and so on and don't need all the frills and animations and the required extra clicks for input, or for exiting tbe story and so on.

I'm not saying Phoenix is all bad, but it doesn't cater to me and I prefer the simpler version.

I'd also much rather see the incapability of the AI to stay in 3rd person fixed (3.4 k actions, all in third person and now I get 20+ consecutive 'redos' that suddenly want to use 'you'... really?) or see it actually keep basic names and relations between characters correct, and maybe be a bit less biased.

Anyway, sorry, got carried away. I just want to know if the 'undo to here' function was forgotten and will still be added, or if it was scrapped and I'm screwed.","True","False","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","44369","public","None","self","None","None","Feature complete?

The NightStalker watching from a distance. Having sperated from the main ship with the blink of an eye to spare....


Blaze looks at the energy signature.... ""I told you the NightStalker making up the Shadow Jumper's inner hull was a good idea."" He tells Rarr.


Looking at his console Blaze hits a few commands in his 3D Holographic display. ""Good... All 1331 crew are on board and the 2 deceased repair crewmen."" He says. 


Blaze idles the ship's core. It's stealth capabilities among the best in the universe.... Sittng back he thinks the himself.


""Dave and Scott only died.. cause of my dumbass."" He looks at the floor of the ship zoning out.... 


""hey...Hey."" 


Blaze snaps back in his seat as Jane snaps her fingers in front of his face.


Jane looks him in his eyes. ""It's not your fault. I should've included all needed information..."" She says holding his hand....


......


......


The Pearl of Pandora continues on towards Mars unaware of the NightStalker following a few light days behind.


Sirro looks at his new Navigation specialist. ""Days till we reach the Sol system and Mars?"" He asks the young man in the seat.


In an instant he answers. ""3 days at our max speed Sir."" 


Sirro smiles. ""Pitiful attempt to impress dad. You shoulda been a real soldier"" He says...


.....


.....


Blaze looks over at Jane as they sit in the mess hall of the ship. ""I think maybe Meliodar should lead the kingdom if we make it back. Just for a while.""


She gives him a quizzical look. ""You know he doesn't like leading the kingdom. Are you still beating yourself up over that. Everyone makes mistakes.... We all messed up. Everyone was in a rush. The back ups thought the same thing.... and honestly it kinda caught me off guard to. Our system update came from the Syndicate and if changed out measuring system. They regulate space travel in the milky way and do basically all but track your ship."" She says.


Sighing she lays her head on on the table.


Blaze lays next her. ""Still. I feel like I've been off lately. Too eager to push things and rush to much."" He says 


""We all do it Blaze."" She says. ""We are all just trying to live and make things better for everyone. Even if we sometimes get it wrong we are still human beings... and the fact you can admit such a thing.""...


A few minutes later Rarr is sitting at his station when the Pearl of Pandora veers off course. 


Rarr tilts his head. ""Nothing is there so why did the do that? He ask himself. 


He adjusts the power to the sensors slowly as he tries to keep the NightStalker's energy signature hidden.


Suddenly the emergency lights come on as a loud siren wails in a dreaded pulsing monotone. Rarr whips his head towards the front viewing window as his skulls protective eye coverings open.


The ship's computer analyzes the sensor readings as Rarr stand up from his seat.


As it finishes the A.I gives a report. Anomalous warp energy detected, energy threshold at maximum capacity, estimated output suggests a rip between universes is forming. 10 light year zone of avoidence is advised.""


Rarr looks at the scanners and gasps rushing over to the emergency shutdown pulling the lever.


The ship drops out of warp with a shudder and it's systems bring it to a stand still just shy of 10 light-years. 


Rarr looks out of the window as it's  shielding opens and bright light shines inside. Adjusting his eyes he can see ribbons of pure energy spanning several light years. It's strange light traveling the universe nearly instantaneously as it's energy stays localized.


Blaze and Jane rush onto the bridge and move beside Rarr.


Jane shakes her head as Blaze let's out a short laugh of annoyed amusement. ""That's definitely not good....""He says.


Jane looks over at Ruby. ""What's the condition of the ship?"" 


Ruby nervously answers. "" We stopped just in time. The electromagnetic energy is right at the NightStalker's limits, Hull temp is steady but we need to get away from the breach.""


Blaze stares at the boundary of the energy just a few 1000 yards away, a wall of exotic matter stretching across space seeming to fill reality.


The NightStalker angles away from the breach and prepares to warp.


Blaze sits in the captains seat as the A.I gives another report. ""Warp field unstable.""


Blaze rests his head in his hand as he lets out a stressed sigh. ""If this is centered where I think it is we just lost the portal to our universe's Galaxy 52."" 


The mood on the bridge grows somber. Rarr looks back to the window. ""That sector was home to trillions."" 


Blaze guides the ship around the tear in space and reaching the other side and regaining a sensor visual on the Pandora just as it's warp drive activates and it vanishes.


Blaze tries to think of a solution to beat the Syndicate to Mars... After a few moments he holds a meeting with the entire crew while the NightStalker travels away from the Anomalous Energy and it's affects...


....


A few hours later Blaze watches as a few warp capable escape pods rocket away into the abyss.


Setting the warp drive parameters to the Forbidden Warp Passage he announces to the remaining half of the crew. ""Last chance to leave ends in about 60 seconds. The warp field might feel strange, we do not know what the forbidden path is like. Only that very few ships make through... and usually severely damaged....it's the only way to beat them to Mars and if we fail. Both universes are doomed and we die anyway."" 


The core pulses randomly as reality around it begins to warp.


As it engages, a pulse of strange energy burst from the Jump Core straining the ship as it rockets through like a phanton blast wave. 


The crew of the ship have the wind knocked out of them and black out from the force of the forming warp bubble and the NightStalker slips into the Forbidden Warp Corridor.","True","False","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","44381","public","None","https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/CAzhbyRYUl1-xDyUC9-ij96a_RrNfHKcLmS7keE6wDo.jpg","140","140","Shadow-Verse: NightStalker","None","0","[]","1695492762","1","1","https://i.redd.it/e2hyyfbdq1qb1.png","[]","None","False","None","None","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","image","True","[{""id"": ""x4RkOq00qe7poXmtIZFCd0_M-Wbl89t5XFZs-HFAfyo"", ""resolutions"": [{""height"": 108, ""url"": ""https://preview.redd.it/e2hyyfbdq1qb1.png?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=bac373165a158919873c38f5f9da5eeafb3d93aa"", ""width"": 108}, {""height"": 216, ""url"": ""https://preview.redd.it/e2hyyfbdq1qb1.png?width=216&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=fc0b5bdf6066144e722df99215a88fbb8978aca9"", ""width"": 216}, {""height"": 320, ""url"": ""https://preview.redd.it/e2hyyfbdq1qb1.png?width=320&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=7ce339776828637cc9c3f05542f9261beecd6c5d"", ""width"": 320}], ""source"": {""height"": 512, ""url"": ""https://preview.redd.it/e2hyyfbdq1qb1.png?auto=webp&s=4ea14ce751f0d821451df5c4e7b5255c50ae1f4b"", ""width"": 512}, ""variants"": {}}]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://i.redd.it/e2hyyfbdq1qb1.png","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I built an entire world with two realms. It's filled with factions, conflicts, dark subjects, curses, artifacts, power struggles, missions/tasks.

This is my first go in any AI as well and within 5 days I've fleshed out nearly half the Mortal continent and organized the social systems and territories and ""kings"" of those territories in the Demon Realm.

My OC was turned into a demon and is chilling with the (pale character) King of The Gate (zone within the Demon Realm that controls the portals in and out of the Mortal Realm. There are currently four zones with four ""Kings"" to start with. May expand.). Everyone wants to control this territory so it's a spiderweb of insanity.

Here are three of the current characters (started with male) that I've met or are fighting.

I'll share my own OC and the female characters I've come across soon!

I'd love to see others create or generate images of the characters in their stories. I'm actually a digital illustration artist, but wanted to quickly get some references in AI before putting hours into rendering.

A young looking man with jet black hair shades his golden brown eyes from the rays of light filtering through the leaves as.


Meliodar grins as he hears the double boom of a spacecraft coming in for a landing.


Sitting up he looks out into the field as the 1200 foot long NightStalker gently sets down he waves.


The boarding ramp opens and he rushes inside. Entering the main corridor he pauses as his foot steps in something. Looking down he freezes as a chunk of flesh lay on the floor. Looking around he sees blood and gouges in the walls.


His heart racing he powers up his aura and dashes down the hall. ""Father where are you!"" He shouts. ""Father!"" He runs faster, his heart pounding in his chest.


He reaches the cockpit and bursts inside finding it abandon.


A sound behind him cause him to turn...


His vision fills with razor sharp claws and he throws himself back into the bridge of the ship.... Landing in front of the captain's seat he looks up and instinctively knocks away another attack as the claw scraps his cheek.


Pushing off the floor the ship is driven a few inches into the ground as Meliodar grabs the creature's arm and turns into a devastating elbow that blasts the creature through the ships front viewing window. 


""Hahaha! Foolish beast! Did you really think you had me?!"" Meliodar laughs as he watches the creature's death throes on the ground as he lands next to it.


 ""There's no way you took out my parents and Rarr..."" he says looking back at the ship.


""So then where are they."" His sister Lilly says as her glowing gold eyes scan the ship. ""They aren't on board and that thing is like nothing I've ever seen. If I didn't know any better that thing isn't dead either."" She says walking over to it.


Raising her hand a burst of white and gold energy washes over the creature and it instantly responds resisting the beam of energy. Lilly pushes her limit and the creature is finally vaporized as she falls to one knee gasping....


Meliodar helps her to her feet. ""There's no way that thing was that strong...""


Lilly's eyes stop glowing. ""Whatever that creature was, it had Leviathan energy like mine."" She says. 


Meliodar looks at the ship. ""Are there more?""


Lilly nods her head. ""About 100 or so more.""


Meliodar clinches his fists trembling slightly. ""We have to go back in and find out what happened. Maybe they are still alive and just hiding from those things."" He tells her.


Lilly shakes her head. ""We can't let those things escape onto New Earth. So far they are staying in the center of the ship."" She tells Meliodar.


 He frowns. ""We need to find out what happened! That is our only chance of knowing!""


Lilly sighs. ""The ship's surveillance should show us. But if we die in there. I'm gonna beat you in our next life when we met again."" She says walking up the ramp.


She stops halfway. ""Are you coming or not?"" 


Meliodar doesn't answer. He looks at the dark corridor ahead and swallows nervously. ""You can track those things right, cause I can't sense them."" He says following close behind.


""Well yeah, true leviathan energy is like god ki, mortals can't sense it. Don't worry, None are even close to us... This ship is as big as the Titanic inside."" She says reassuring him.


""I know. I'm just nervous."" He says.
She squeezes his shoulder and continues leading the way.


They reach the bridge and Lilly begins going through the security footage....


Meliodar gets behind the captain's console and gets the jump data on a storage crystal as well...


""!!Get!!""


""!!Out!!""


Meliodar and Lilly look towards the doorway...


A distortion forms and a figure appears as a phantom image for a brief moment but then it's gone.


""Father!"" The siblings say rushing to the door. 


Lilly spins around towards the captain's chair. ""!!How did that thing do that!!."" She says firing an energy blast at a horse sized wolfish bear-like creature.


Meliodar looks at her. ""!!I thought you could sense them!!"" He jesters towards the creature as the hole in its head smokes.


Lilly glares at him. ""I can! It just appeared there as it vanished from the jump core room.... We need to get back to Redemption and find out what's going on.""


As they leave the ship Lilly turns around and leaps away as a creature tries to attack from behind. It lands rolling in the meadow and then looking around.... It tries to run into the Forbidden Forest but drops to the ground in agony 100 feet from the ship. It claws it's way back towards the ship and stops it's cries... 


Looking at Lilly and Meliodar it bears it's teeth in a lion like growl couples with a raptor like hiss as they disappear into the Forest.


Meliodar looks back. ""Well at least it seems like they can't leave the ship's energy field.""


....

....


Hours later they arrive back at the Kingdom of Redemption. Walking into the throne room Meliodar sees his brother Dante.


Lilly shakes her head. ""We have a massive problem... Dad's ship is back but.... We can't find them anywhere and there are these creatures in their ship that for some reason can't leave the energy field around the NightStalker."" She says pausing..."" oh and they took alot for me to take down two. ""


Dante raises an eyebrow. ""Um. What happened to the Shadow Jumper? It can't be that bad.""


Suddenly the large door into the room slams open and everyone gasps as a creature claws it's way into the room. It's aura sparking as it seems to fight some other invisible force. Just ahead of the creature a distortion appears and a figure comes into view.


""The Jump Core energy...."" The ghostly image of Blaze says through gritted teeth. ""It needs to be set to normal vibrations."" He falls to a knee. 


Meliodar instinctively moves to help and passes through him. 


Meliodar jumps back as the physical creature lunges forward and grabs Blaze in it's claws. Everyone's eyes widen in surprise as Lilly dashes forward. Reaching the creature and her father the hair on her neck stands up.


""Oh"". She says blocking a temporal warp gates explosive formation and closure as the creature and their father vanish from the room.


Meliodar slams his fist into the floor cracking the large marble surface of the throne room... ""I..What just.. How did it grab him like that?"" He says looking dazed.


Lilly slaps him across the face. ""Snap out of the guilt trip. I didn't think it could touch him either... but I know how it did. It felt just like being on a ship when it forms a warp bubble.... "" she pauses thinking.


""That thing could grab dad cause it can warp through dimensions.... Our father was also struggling against what seemed like maybe this reality not being the energy to exist freely in.... We would have to go into the ship.""


Meliodar crosses his arms. ""There's hundreds of those things... and our old man was able to make it here, maybe they know something else we don't"".

I played in on and off, but never managed to do anything compelling with the Griffin model, so all my attempts of playing it ended up with me being bored after a day and not playing for a few months.

Recently though, I heard about the new ChatGPT model, gave it a try and I was blown away. Still not perfect, but crazy fun nonetheless.

I started my 1 week free trial and I‚Äôve been having the time of my life for 3 days now. Created a Dragon Ball Z world and did missions as a Saiyan and stuff like that lol (yea I‚Äôm a weeb). That said, I feel like I ran out of ideas on how to make my games exciting. I still very much want to play the game though ! 

What do y‚Äôall do to keep your adventures going ? Quests ? New NPCs ? Create a new world every now and then ? Can the AI itself give me ideas on how to keep going in the adventure I created ? 

Feel free to share some of your favorite settings to play in too ! (Fantasy, cyberpunk, magic ‚Ä¶)

This is my first post here, and i'm very excited to share with you all my first project based on VTM.

What do you guys think? It's obviously a +18 scenario with custom character creation.  
I've managed to create almost all of the classical clans and build the Camarilla and sketch some Sabbath shenanigans.

Could you guys test it and give some feedback on how i could improve it?

One of our success criteria that must be met prior to retiring Legacy AI Dungeon is that we listen to and address player feedback. We‚Äôd like to share some of the feedback we‚Äôve been collecting and set expectations for changes coming to AI Dungeon as a result. These are in no particular order.

## List View / Cards View

*Expected Before Legacy Retires | Needs Solution Discovery*

Not everyone is a fan of the card view in AI Dungeon. One of the drawbacks to a card design is that it limits the amount of text that can be shown for each content item and, in certain contexts, can feel like a less efficient use of space. These limitations are particularly noticeable on the search results page and on the Story Card manager.

One of our favorite suggestions is to explore a ‚ÄúList View.‚Äù This is a pattern common on other platforms, which provide the ability toggle between a Card view and a List view. A list view should be able to allow for more text to be displayed per content item.

We‚Äôll share designs and gather feedback soon.

## Images

*Expected Before Legacy Retires | Needs Solution Discovery*

The images in AI Dungeon were one of the things players were excited about for the Phoenix transition. As players have had a chance to play around with Phoenix, we‚Äôve heard that there aren‚Äôt enough images, the images aren‚Äôt relevant, or that it‚Äôs hard to find an image that matches a Scenario or Adventure.

There are a few different ways we could solve this. We could expand the image library and add thousands more images. We could also provide a way for players to use custom images for their content, either through generating images using AI, by uploading images or providing a URL to an image. Each of these solutions comes with questions that we still need to answer (such as moderation). Many would require additional UI and UX to be built, so it‚Äôs not a quick and easy thing to add.

We will improve the image experience before Legacy retires. As we get further in the discovery process, we‚Äôll provide an update on what will be added before Legacy retires.

## Scenario Filters

*Expected Before Legacy Retires | Needs Solution Discovery*

We‚Äôve shared recently that Worlds are in the process of being merged into Scenarios, and that Phoenix Scenarios have been enhanced with features from Legacy Worlds. Players have asked that, as part of this transition, we adjust the filtering options on the profile and search pages so it‚Äôs easier to find Scenarios based on whether they use the Simple Story, Character Creator, or Multiple Choice options. We agree this is an important functionality and will make this adjustment prior to retiring Legacy.

## Clickable Tags

*Expected Before Legacy Retires | Solution Identified*

Technically, this is a bug, but it‚Äôs been brought up enough we wanted to include it on this list. On the detail pages for Adventures and Scenarios, we display tags that the creator listed for the content. On Legacy, these tags were clickable and would trigger a search using the tag as the search criteria. We‚Äôll be restoring that functionality on the details pages for Phoenix as well, so that any tag can be clicked and initiate a search.

## Text Display Options

*Expected Before Legacy Retires | Needs Solution Discovery*

For a text-based game like AI Dungeon, it‚Äôs inevitable that players will want to adjust the look of the text. Display settings were on our Phoenix roadmap, but based on player feedback, we‚Äôve decided it needs to be worked on before retiring Legacy.

We don‚Äôt plan on copying the customization settings we had on Legacy, so there will be a few differences. For instance, the display settings will apply to the game screen only instead of the entire app. We also recognize that the Legacy display settings were used to make the game easier to see for those with a visual impairment, so we‚Äôll spend time making sure there are good options for different needs.

If you don‚Äôt see something on this list, let us know! There are a number of smaller fixes and bugs we plan to address as well before retiring Legacy.
