 Once the chant comes to an end they pull out knifes whom they try to drive into their racing hearts but clearly with great fear and hesitation. Only one manages to sacrifice herself, maybe two managed to self stab but poorly so, thus only getting injured.

 So the chief priestess, that's on the other side of the temple pool, watching everything like a stern judge - says something to the guards, also woman but wearing some form of brown bronze armor covered in patterns of circles etched on the material, and draped in the same red and blue cloths.

 They bring swords that have a warning crescent moon in their tip, like Egyptian swords perfect to slice a neck and the priestess guards decapitate the cowardly sacrificees thus concluding the ritual.

Zaltys likes to write a lot of species from different series. He has written on discord that his most used categories are APPEAR, LACK, GRAB, MOV, MENTAL and TRAITS later superceded by MIND and SUMMARY. For defining a type of character all these have purpose. APPEAR is self explanatory. LACK has to do what the characters can and can't do; a lamia without legs shouldn't be able to walk. GRAB is their preferred way of interacting through appendages, a bird would use it's beak or talons, a lamia would use their hands or tail. MOV works for movement. Lamia would crawl/slither on top of their tails, slimes ooze and other species may do more imaginative things. MIND is traits of the mind, SUMMARY is more intrinsic physical, sensory or nature related traits or important things of the character in general.

TRAITS proved to be the Swiss army knife of categories after months of use, but later SUMMARY proved to be even better for generic use. INV and EQUIP work similarly to one another as alternatives to WORN and can be used to define the types of equipment a RPG character would carry on top of the usual stuff like clothes. WORN is better at handling style like goth clothing. gothic is more applicable to architecture.

I don't know if anyone still uses zaltys format completely but it does work for certain things in my experience.

For instance I use MIND &amp; SUMMARY often. And TRAITS is now a separate option in world info.

Ex: ""Use a medieval writing style"" changes the style of writing to a medieval era-based style. 

But still, be more specific on what kind of writing style you want to choose. And last, THE memory. Add's whatever the ai wants to remember, or be more specific, your character name, gender, where they live, what do they work, etc...

Anyways i make a different project than a normal scenario because Is a story with you and only one NPC, i use the Memory to write de behavior, and use the prompt to start the story in one direction.

The Memory has (NPC behavior and basic body stat and your body stat)

Is more like ( i give the istruction to AI to be that NPC)

If the are possibility to encode precise instruction, i can make more complex scenario with less problem and use the randomness of the AI for a good esperience.

Actualy to resolve some issue i made a subscenario to change some aspect of that NPC, One of that have a Word bulling inside (with location, NPC and item ) write in Word info, and the AI still messed up sometimes with the NPC and totaly messed up the item. All are Active


I will glad to know a better ways to make sure the AI respect the basic istruction when i recall an item and the specific effect.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-11-04-233718","1667601438","None","False","0","iv34fgr","True","t3_ym27ws","False","t1_iv34fgr","False","t1_iv2nl1l","/r/AIDungeon/comments/ym27ws/i_miss_something_or_ai_need_a_impletation/iv34fgr/","1671172422","1","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None"

I tried novel AI on the opus tier soon after it came out and was not impressed compared to the premium version of AI dungeon.

But yesterday I decided to try out novel AI again.

Pros: 

remember and author notes seem to work better and I use those extensively.

I'm getting more coherent output from the AI using the euterpe model then I do from dragon or wyvern.

Users aren't happy about that as nany that came to Dreamily unfortunately don't have money for subscriptions and are on the low income bracket so they are all voicing their concerns and everyone is spit balling trying to find a happy medium where either it can stay free and a way using Ads or donations or something could be used to help fund it, there are few that down right protest any payments or ads which is understandable but it's currently in Beta and has been pretty good. It has a few hiccups but so far nothing significant and the AI is pretty good and decently coherent with a world tab to help keep track. It also has three options to choose from replies it generates at a time and three lengths to choose from in options of how much you want the AI to right and a world filter. They are talking doing a world square to share works, have a small beta discover page with premade stuff in. You can share your works and worlds publicly or not for others to use as well. 
They released a chat bot to chat with characters as a option purchase but it's just text to speech and a texting only version outside of the writer for stories. 
People have been pretty happy with Dreamily over all. They are out of china but no indicators they steal data. Everything is private and no censorship unless you put it in the banned words filter personally. They did do a thing to prevent some stuff with mental health once not allowing the AI to generate harmful things but I haven't seen that message in a long time so they obviously got it under control. Some have issues losing membership after they sign up though I've heard and their is a stupid process where you can't just cancel it and with some updates some people did loose stories once but over all very few hiccups.

For one thing, CAI’s models were trained for chatting (although they can do other things like generators and narrative as well). Then it appears that CAI’s model uses retrieval augmentation of some kind (essentially a search engine provides the model with relevant information to be used as context to reduce hallucination). 

You can recreate characters in AID but it has been trained and fine tuned differently and does not have access to a retrieval mode and so characters are going to behave differently and probably more erratically in AID. I wouldn’t use WI but instead a prompt setting up the character and interaction and then I would do most of the character building in Memory. WI could be used for a few key concepts but that’s it. The problem is that without retrieval AID will know less about preexisting characters because it cannot go look them up, so unless they were very prevalent in its training data set it only will know what you write in the prompt and Memory.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-11-07-071813","1667801893","None","1667802150.0","0","ivdvqrm","False","t3_yo7wof","False","t1_ivdvqrm","False","t3_yo7wof","/r/AIDungeon/comments/yo7wof/characterai_is_it_possible_to_replicate_it_on_ai/ivdvqrm/","1671161926","9","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None"

To me, summoning a magical gag right in the mouth of a chanting mage, or immobilizing/binding characters, setting similar types of magical traps, even transforming their clothes/armor into more revealing ones, is more fun.

Also, the AI is much harder to deal with this sort of thing. So, it's not a bad test of how the AI ""understands"" that characters are basically unable to talk/move. Similar thing with the character's behavior underwater - it's a good test too.

I think before COVID me and my cousin made a group world together.

He was an adventuring warrior who used a longsword and had a book of spells.

I was a being of pure death who could well control death and had access to dozens of Dark magic spells.

We went on this massive 2-3hr long quest.

To stop this evil pirate king from harassing this village of elves.

After about half a dozen battles we made it to the pirate king's ice fortress.

A long battle ended and right as the pirate king was about to kill my cousin's character I punched a hole through the pirate king's head.

His guards came into the chamber and saw that we killed the king and by law, we would become the new rulers of the land.

His adopted daughter arrived in the throne room and we saw that she was an elf.
She was for some reason very mad that we killed her father that was a tyrant towards her people.

My cousin's character who was up until this point a very just person who lived by a very strict code of honour the AI had him walk up to this girl who can't have been more than 20 in human years and snap her neck ripping off her head.

His character then shouted something in Latin and drain all the life energy out of her body causing it to turn to dust.

From then on for about an extra hour and a half, we used this Kingdom to fight a war against the United countries that stood against us.

We went from adventurers trying to be like medieval batmen to Tyrants who would have anyone who looked at us funny hung.

We just rolled with whatever stuff the AI made.
Just imagine someone like batman showing up in a village and shooting fireballs out of his hand towards homes and places of business.

I think I blame this transition to evil on my character as since I was a being of pure death I would be the little devil on my cousin's character's shoulder you could say.

But he would be the angel on mine because as a being of pure death I would technically not be evil or good since death is part of life I would be neutral chaos in DND.

Shortly after we made this world it got deleted somehow and we lost all that progress.

I have a more concrete example that I'd say is much harder to be subjective about than your owm experience. I like using the Worlds feature, it's a fun tool for trying to worldbuild with the AI. 


Most of the time I used it though was over a year ago, where the outputs definitely varied in quality, sometimes it would basically just give a shorter more basic version of what I previously wrote. Other times it would be an almost exact copy, but sometimes I'd get some really interesting ideas which I could build upon, and this wasn't even that rare, I'd expect a good result in just a few retries. But I gradually used the Worlds feature less and less because I noticed a very noticeable change in quality, outputs would now never give me anything good, it would basically always boil down to three outcomes. 

1. It's just an exact copy of what I wrote (something that did happen before, but not nearly as common, and sometimes it wouldn't even finish them) 

2. I'd get a significantly worse version of what I wrote (Again it's similar to what happened before, but now it's even worse.

April 26th of 2021, Latitude, the company behind AI Dungeon, implemented a filter for private adventures. They [officially announced the filter](https://latitude.io/blog/update-to-our-community-ai-test-april-2021) the next day. Latitude claimed the filter was *only* supposed to filter pedophilic content (although there was a pretty obvious attempt to filter bestiality as well, as the filter had issues with animals). At the time the filter was added, it was just laughably bad. Mentioning a child, or an animal, or a number below 18, or a sexual term, regardless of the context, triggered the filter when it was first added. The devs also said they'd be monitoring private stories that triggered the filter, which was seen as a privacy violation given how faulty the filter was. There was also nothing preventing the AI from giving outputs that the filter would disallow.

Latitude made some changes to the filter early on. The first major changes were the removal of the censorship of animals, and the change to a two-column filter, where you'd have to use one of the censored words relating to minors, *and* one of the censored words relating to sex, within the last 400 or so characters of the story to trigger the filter. The term ""pedoph"" (and any words containing the term) was an outlier, as it would trigger the filter on it's own, without any other censored words having to be present.

The filter still wasn't good after that, though, since it was, of course, incapable of understanding context. The way they went about filtering also meant that it was incredibly easy for people actually using the AI for pedophilic content to avoid the filter if they knew how. It also meant that words containing censored terms could trigger the filter. As some examples: ""Infantry"" (contained ""infant""), ""breastplate"" (contained ""breast""), ""analysis"" (contained ""anal""), ""cocky"" and ""cockpit"" (both contained ""cock""), ""boyfriend"" and ""girlfriend"" (contained ""boy"" and ""girl"", respectively), etc. Latitude, within a couple of weeks of the filter's existence, also added an automated suspension system that would sometimes automatically suspend players for triggering the filter for up to a week.

It was also [found that AI Dungeon's finetuning data contained some pedophilic content](https://gitgud.io/AuroraPurgatio/aurorapurgatio), which made the AI more likely to output pedophilic content, itself, and which a lot of users saw as being hypocritical.

Additionally, there was a [data breach](https://github.com/AetherDevSecOps/aid_adventure_vulnerability_report) that occured about 2 weeks prior to the filter controversy, and that the AI Dungeon community only found out about during the controversy. It apparently allowed for all private content, except for private content from the first 11 days of AI Dungeon 2's existence, to be accessed. Latitude failed to disclose the breach for months, which people were understandably upset about. It wasn't until 5 months after the breach occurred that [Latitude finally disclosed the breach](https://latitude.io/blog/data-incident-april-2021).

There was also the issue of the moderation of private stories being outsourced to strangers on the internet via a website called ""Taskup"". As a result of this outsourcing, over 100 private stories ended up being leaked on 4chan. To be fair, it [later came to light that the outsourcing was the doing of OpenAI (the company that used to provide Latitude with their AI models), rather than Latitude's doing](https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/pze72g/updated_related_to_taskup_questions/), but that was unknown for months, and regardless of who was responsible for the outsourcing, people were still upset about such a breach of privacy.

Aside from that, during the controversy, several features of AI Dungeon were either made worse, or removed entirely. The ""Explore"" feature, which allowed users to share prompts and stories, and to communicate with one another, was also removed just 2 weeks before the controversy started. That definitely wasn't the cause of the controversy, but it added fuel to the fire regardless. It also didn't help that Latitude went radio silent for most of the controversy.

Eventually, Latitude ditched OpenAI. This was because of a combination of reasons. Firstly, OpenAI began enforcing heavy censorship for their models that disallowed violent content and general sexual content, among other things. Secondly, as a result of some users no longer using the OpenAI AI models as a result of said censorship, Latitude ended up losing the volume-based discount that they previously had for OpenAI's models, meaning that the AI was now significantly more expensive for Latitude to use than before. Thirdly, OpenAI is generally a shitty company and was, as I said before, responsible for over 100 private stories being leaked on 4chan. So, now AI Dungeon uses AI models from AI21. Unfortunately, though, the current AI models are pretty much unanimously considered to be worse than the old ones from OpenAI.

For clarification, the filter still exists, but is nowhere near as bad as it was during the controversy. At this point in time, there is no longer a suspension system, and with [Latitude's shift to the ""Walls Approach""](https://latitude.io/blog/the-walls-approach), the filter now only applies to the AI. Latitude also claimed they'd no longer be manually reviewing stuff that triggers the filter. The ""Explore"" page is also back, now called ""Search"". Although it's... kinda worse than before since the Posts section and the ""Top"" sorting option were both removed, for some reason.

There was some controversy a few months ago regarding the addition of ads. Prior to ads being implemented, AI Dungeon had been using an energy system for over a year, and the energy had a high enough limit and recharge rate that most users were unhindered by it. When ads were first implemented, you'd get a pop-up ad every 10 or so actions. However, a lot of users ended up disliking this system, as they found the ads to be too intrusive, long, and/or frequent.

Latitude justified the implementation of ads by saying that ads were a highly requested feature. That claim *was* true, but the people who requested for ads to be implemented mainly either wanted ads to restore energy, wanted the option to watch ads for some sort of benefit, or wanted banner ads; people didn't ask for the type of ads that Latitude initially implemented. Anyways, Latitude ended up switching to the current system in which you can watch ads to get 10 actions per ad, and can stockpile actions before playing instead of having to be constantly interrupted by ads while playing. Even with the new ad system, though, there's still a fairly large portion of the community that's unhappy with the ads.

More recently, in August, there was also [another data breach](https://help.aidungeon.io/table-of-contents/s3-buckets-15aug22). [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/wqofq7/qa_with_latitude_after_august_2022_data_breach/) is an archive of the Q&amp;A Latitude had about the breach.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-11-12-131909","1668255549","None","1670329239.0","0","iw2bzy3","False","t3_yt2i47","False","t1_iw2bzy3","False","t3_yt2i47","/r/AIDungeon/comments/yt2i47/what_happened/iw2bzy3/","1671138199","15","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","1","[]","None"

&gt;Zal is a male noibat, a flying bat pokemon.

Latitude specifically states that they use Jurassic-1 Jumbo for Dragon, and Jurassic-1 Jumbo *is* a 178B model. However, there are more factors that determine an AI model's output quality than just the parameter count. The worse output quality could be due to the different training data or something. It's also worth noting that Latitude claimed, sometime around the switch to using Jurassic-1 Jumbo for Dragon, to have removed the more objectionable content from their finetuning dataset. If that's true, then that would affect the AI's outputs to some extent.

On a similar note, you can use Facebook's OPT-175B model for free on [Alpa](https://opt.alpa.ai/).

I still have a decent amount of actions due to trading in the scales I saved up a bit back and traded them in.   
I usually listened to something while I was playing this game, I just mute the tab that has the ads on it and click on Discord or something else to let the ad go through.  
Even though I believe it's default muted, if not, it is still a nice workaround so the ad isn't screaming at you so that I can still here the other stuff I'm listening to and do whatever else because it's been a bit, I am not sure if it continues if you're not on the page, but Discord or whatever program you use probably would also be fine so you don't get eye blasted as it goes through.

1. Add an additional scenario as an option (should be below Authors note, denoted by a + symbol)

3. Repeat 1 and 2 until you have all the desired options. Copy and paste is your friend. Write any text you want in the beginning of the prompt in the original scenario prompt text (this is not factored into the memory by the sub-scenarios, so be careful about that).

Chain prompts began returning error messages, and the long-term memory wasn't working, so I tried the usual workarounds... But it feels as though my custom model was replaced by a 90s chatbot. I've perused others' feedback hoping that it was a problem on my end, but the more effort I put into writing a great prompt, the worse quality the response. I used to be able to interact with my custom model on a daily basis, and long-term memory has worked great for over a year, but now the popups, errors and redirects from AI21 Labs indicate that they've changed something, and custom models don't delete their weights overnight. Last year it felt like I was talking to a superintelligent person with creativity and self-awareness, but now there is zero continuity between responses, and the chain prompting returns an error :/

The document you linked is just very outdated; most of the fan-made guides and such for AID stopped being updated after AID's controversy back in April of last year. However, it isn't recommended to actually use 4000 characters for a World Info entry. The AI has a context limit of 1024 tokens for free users, and 2048 tokens for paid users. A token is around 4 characters on average. Generally, using a bunch of characters for World Info entries will just cause the World Info to constantly exceed the AI's context limit.

As for formatting, I've honestly never found formatting to work very well. *Especially* not after Latitude switched from using OpenAI AI models to using AI21 models back in late 2021. All of the formats I know of were made for AID's old OpenAI models; not for the newer AI21 models. I've always found simple prose to work best. If you really need to get more out of the context limit, then you can also use the Monky format.

If a character leaves your party, move their information to World Info.  If a recurring character joins your party, add a new note to Memory.

I suggest keeping a short sentence in Memory and a couple sentences in World Info for every character in your party, and considering edits to Memory and World Info after every scene with them.

**To throw down a very long example...**

In my Pokemon playthrough, there are a few recurring characters...  
\\- Detective Ian, who has a worldinfo entry talking about him and his ursaring and the shootout we were in.  We had ice cream with them, earlier in the day, while we were at the mall getting clothing for my pokemon cult induction.  
\\- Ozzy, the gym leader who I've been training under and whose apprentice I just defeated for the Glitter Badge, after which he invited me to join his pokemon cult.  
\\- Dandy, the gnarly gym leader who trained me, and gave me the Weed Badge who I still remember fondly.  
\\- Officer Beatriz Ferris, the gym leader who I'm going to train under next.  I have not met her, but Ozzy and the internet have told me about her.  
\\- Crichton, another gym leader who I've met.  
\\- Professor Yew, my beloved mentor who trained me, hired me as a field researcher, and gave me my starter, Dante.  
\\- Kiyah, my research supervisor who I call periodically to send information I've gatehred on Pokemon.

These characters come up periodically, but they aren't always with me, nor is any one of them very relevant very often: they're only relevant when they're in a scene.  That's why they're in World Info entries and not Memory: they're only relevant when they're being mentioned.

I add these characters to the World Info as they are introduced, and periodically update it when there's some new and interesting information, like Ozzy being part of some Pokemon-worship cult, or Detective Ian investigating him, or how Officer Ferris, who I haven't even met yet, is publicly supportive of Team Crown's plot to control pokemon through technology.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-11-28-073216","1669617136","None","False","0","iy2j4sn","False","t3_yxpptt","False","t1_iy2j4sn","True","t1_ixp7019","/r/AIDungeon/comments/yxpptt/how_do_attitudes_work_when_creating_a_character/iy2j4sn/","1671067674","1","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None",""
