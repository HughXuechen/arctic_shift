20240501-034659,t3_1chcj4z,Discussion,"The Llama Model. It’s fantastic and allows for more gore filled scenes in my story, which includes a lot of violence and even a suicide by poisoning.
What I did notice recently is that while the model performs quite well, it doesn’t seem quite good at picking up certain styles, my main issues being that my story is both Third Person and Past Tense.
Perhaps it’s like the Mixtral Model that begins to pick it up after its response is edited to my liking but I have yet to test this theory. If anyone has any ideas on how to make this work I am looking for new ideas that’ll help keep things on track. AI instructions seems like a good place to start but its wording those instructions I struggle with the most.

20240501-052619,t3_1che8m1,Mixtral settings for consistent character personalities,"Hey everyone, I'm messing around with AI Dungeon and Mixtral, trying to get characters to stay true to their personalities - you know, like having a princess use fancy words and a gangster throw in some slang.
I've played with different settings

Started with the defaults: Temperature 0.8, top_p 0.95, top_k 50
Tried temperature 1.2-1.3, top_p 0.85, top_k 200-300
Even went up to temperature 2.0, top_p 0.65

Aside from higher temperatures making things more random, I didn't really see top_p and top_k changes doing much for keeping characters consistent.
Has anyone found settings that actually make a noticeable difference in characters sticking to their personalities and ways of talking? I get the basic idea behind each setting, but I'm still kinda confused about whether it's better to have a higher temperature and lower top_p, and if top_k in the 200-300 range is good. Not sure if I'm just doing it wrong or if I'm misunderstanding something.",6,1,t2_63i8qbze,/r/AIDungeon/comments/1che8m1/mixtral_settings_for_consistent_character/,1714670785,[],False,,,False,AnyStudio4402,,,[],,,,text,False,False,False,[],,,False,False,,False,,False,1714541179,1714541179,,,self.AIDungeon,0,False,0,False,False,1che8m1,False,True,False,False,False,True,True,False,,#349e48,,[],ae468a20-1ac8-11ea-af43-0effba01f5bd,Questions,dark,text,False,,False,,,,[],True,1,0,,False,,False,,False,,,,,1714541196,False,6,,True,False,False,AIDungeon,t5_29uaei,r/AIDungeon,45505,public,,self,,,,0,[],https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/1che8m1/mixtral_settings_for_consistent_character/,[],,False,,
