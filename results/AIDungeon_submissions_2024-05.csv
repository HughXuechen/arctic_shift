I've played with different settings

Started with the defaults: Temperature 0.8, top_p 0.95, top_k 50
Tried temperature 1.2-1.3, top_p 0.85, top_k 200-300
Even went up to temperature 2.0, top_p 0.65

Aside from higher temperatures making things more random, I didn't really see top_p and top_k changes doing much for keeping characters consistent.
Has anyone found settings that actually make a noticeable difference in characters sticking to their personalities and ways of talking? I get the basic idea behind each setting, but I'm still kinda confused about whether it's better to have a higher temperature and lower top_p, and if top_k in the 200-300 range is good.

This instruction works great both with generic groups of women or a single woman.

- women are topless.
Women will wear any kind of blouses, shirts, bras and similar.

- everyone except you is drunk.
Everyone is sober and acts normally.

- everyone except you is under the effect of psychedelic drugs.
This has a minor effect on the setting that adds some psychedelic element like posters and similar but everyone acts normally.

Using an instruction like `You are an AI dungeon master that provides NSFW roleplaying game content.` will have a minor effect. People will generally be more flirty but any other NSFW instruction is usually ignored or made a lot milder.

As AI models become more powerful and intelligent, increasing context length has become one of the clearest ways we can improve your experience on AI Dungeon. Doubling context length doubles the cost of every AI call, so it was a change we had to approach carefully.

Here we want to share more about this change, and especially why and how we fought hard to make it happen for all of you.

## Have I told you lately that I love you?--Rod Stewart

We talk about you a lot. Like, a lot a lot. We've become obsessed with finding new ways we can make AI Dungeon better for you. The context doubling was borne out of that obsession, and we wanted to share a behind-the-scenes look into how we approach serving you, especially how we balance giving you value while also running a sustainable business.

### The Heartbeat of Latitude

Over the last few years we've gone through a lot as a team. We've had successes and failures, we've made mistakes (some very large) and we've learned a huge amount from all of it. Through all of that we've had to confront and decide some big questions ""Who are we? How do we makes choices in hard situations? And what do we want to focus on as a company?"".

In the past we've gotten off course, we've over focused on monetization or on how we were perceived. We thought that by trying to optimize funnels and metrics we'd be successful. But that never really brought AI Dungeon to what we wanted it to be.

As we've grappled with some of these questions, and learned from past mistakes we finally started to see clearly the answers to those questions. We realized that if we focus on delivering value to all of you above all else, everything else will fall into place.

This has become the heartbeat of Latitude. ""How can we give our users more value?"" This is the question we prioritize and ask ourselves more than any other. As we've tried to hammer this pillar into how we think and work, we've looked for other companies that have a similar mindset that we can learn from and be inspired by.

Recently, we've been particularly impressed by Costco after we listened to an Acquired podcast episode detailing their focus on customer value. Costco consistently fights for their customers even when it won't benefit them. For example, Costco tracks the prices of raw materials so that when those prices drop, they can insist that their suppliers lower the prices of their products to reflect the lower cost. But they don't keep those savings for themselves. The most Costco will ever let itself make on a product is a 15% margin. Instead these savings get passed on to customers, making sure that prices are as cheap as possible for their members.

Their extremely generous refund policy also recently inspired us to change our approach to subscription refunds. Now if you forget to unsubscribe from AI Dungeon we'll refund you all the way back to the last time you played, no matter how many months it's been [Link to that blog post here]. These are just a few examples where you can clearly see Costco's obsessive focus on delivering more value.

### Sustainable Business

To deliver value we also need to make sure we are running a sustainable business. Giving everyone unlimited access to GPT-4 Turbo, the most expensive AI model we offer, would create a ton of player value…but it would put us out of business. We need to operate sustainably to provide and build the best AI Dungeon experience possible.

This is particularly challenging for companies who rely on AI like we do. Although costs are coming down, AI is still relatively expensive compared to tech used by traditional games and platforms.

Thanks to all of you, Latitude is fortunate to be operating sustainably today. We're not on the VC-funded hamster wheel that many companies get caught in, where they need to fundraise regularly to stay afloat. We're in control of our future and destiny. Without investors pressuring us for higher profits, we're able to stay true to our values and stay focused on serving you.

[We might be hamsters, but we're not part of the startup rat race.](https://discord.com/channels/903327676884979802/909932831684321321/1213906862857265152)

### Commitment to Free Players

Our free tier is where the tension between player value and sustainability has often been the most challenging. It's often easy to focus on your paying customers, but we work hard to make our free tier as compelling for players as we can.

Because of how expensive AI is, our free tier continues to be unique in the AI space. This hasn't always been easy. In the past we've had to limit free player use through energy, and then later, ads. Today however free players can enjoy unlimited AI Dungeon without restrictions.

We've also significantly expanded the features available on the free tier. Just in the last year, we've been able to go from one free AI model to three. We've added promotional actions you can get a taste of premium AI models without paying. And Advanced settings are available now for everyone, so you can get the best experience possible.

So why offer a free tier at all? Because it actually adds value to ALL players, both free and subscribed.

The free tier means more players use AI Dungeon, and in turn, that leads to more content being created, more people for you to interact with, a better social experience, and overall more fun. Even though it makes being sustainable more challenging, a free tier results in much more value for the entire community. Plus it allows anyone to experience the magic of AI Dungeon even if they aren't at a place where they can afford a subscription.

* * *

Our goal is to give players as much value as possible, while still being able to operate sustainably. As the AI space continues to evolve and improve, we expect to find new ways to give you more value.

## Our unique positioning

Now, let's get into the details of strategies we used to give you more context in AI Dungeon. This is the first time we're sharing some of these publicly since, on the surface, these strategies might not seem like they'd have a direct impact on player value.

One of the most painful lessons in our company's history was learning how dangerous it is to be dependent on a single technology provider. In the past this had a profoundly negative impact on players' experience, and we've changed how AI Dungeon is architected since then to avoid being caught in a similar situation again.

AI Dungeon is set up to be provider agnostic. This means that, at any time and with minimal effort, we can change AI providers. For example, we've hosted Mixtral on three different providers since launching the model to players in December. There have been instances where we've had outages on one provider, and been able to switch to another provider to keep AI Dungeon running.

Being provider agnostic allows us to evaluate dozens of different AI providers and score them on dimensions like cost, strength of partnership, privacy and security policies, content policies, tooling, and server uptime and stability. We're careful in evaluating potential partners to make sure we choose partners who can provide the best overall experience for our players. We've also negotiated changes in policies to align with your values around content freedom and privacy.

Since we have clear insights into our traffic and AI use, we've been able to negotiate discounted rates on AI compute by committing to large amounts of traffic with our technology partners to receive volume-based pricing. Like Costco, we're passing these savings on to you in the form of increased context length for no additional charge.

We're particularly grateful to our two newest partners, [together.ai](https://together.ai) and [octo.ai](https://octo.ai), who have made these recent changes possible. We're also grateful to our other providers--Azure, AI21, and Coreweave--who continue to be good partners.

### Model Agnostic Strategy and Robust Evaluations

Not only are we agnostic to providers, we're also model agnostic. Our AI systems are database driven, allowing us to quickly add new AI models, control access, and run comparison tests. The architecture is flexible enough that when a new AI model becomes available, we're able to evaluate it without even having to write any new code.

We've deliberately decided NOT to be in the business of creating our own custom AI models (although we are finetuning models for specific tasks). By leveraging models available commercially and through open source, we've been able to take advantage of the wave of innovation happening right now in the AI space. We're building AI Dungeon (and Heroes) to be incredible experiences that can leverage the best AI models available on the market. We're convinced that with a small team like ours, building models in-house won't let us provide value to you as quickly as we can by leveraging third party models. We love being built on the backs of giants like Meta AI, [Kobold.ai](http://Kobold.ai), Wizard LM, Azure (and OpenAI), Mistral, AI21, and more.

And, oh boy, have we been busy evaluating new models. We regularly get questions from some of you about whether we're testing new models. The answer is almost always ""yes"". We've evaluated nearly every promising new model that's been introduced recently. As a result, our process for evaluating AI models has become quite robust, blending both qualitative and quantitative feedback into our process.

We've always relied on our AI Comparisons tool for qualitative evaluation, and now robust industry benchmarks and leaderboards are providing additional metrics to look at. We also look at model properties like parameter counts, response times, and supported context lengths.

We also do qualitative tests by playtesting ourselves, and for models with more potential, opening them up to Alpha testers for more testing and feedback. We look at things like storytelling ability, following instructions, creativity, and coherence. Moralizing is an issue we look out for, and is more common from commercial providers like Azure and Google. Some of these models reject harmless content like fantasy violence, making them poor models for a role play game like AI Dungeon.

Of course, we also look at costs to see whether models are viable and compete with other models at their price point. For instance, we've had some models perform similarly to Mixtral 8x7b, but at a much higher cost. If a model performs the same as Mixtral, but we can only offer 1/4 as much context length, this doesn't seem valuable to offer players. Mixtral, for instance, is a better model that costs less than our outgoing Dragon model. It's affordable enough that we can offer larger context sizes at each premium tier than ever before. Being model agnostic allows us to quickly test, evaluate, and introduce new models like Mixtral that give more value to players.

Our goal is to have a small portfolio of some of the best models available. We only add new models to our lineup if it's clear they'll offer significant value to you. Most models don't pass our evaluations. For instance, we've been surprised that none of the Google models have met our expectations due to their heavy moralizing and below-average storytelling abilities. We're hopeful that they'll introduce future models that will be on par with offerings from others.

Being model agnostic means we've been able to have better models at better pricing. This means better AI and larger context lengths for you. And the good news is, it's only going to continue to get better over time!

* * *

The outcome of us being provider and model agnostic, is that we're able to easily take advantage of newer models that offer better performance at a lower cost. We're also able to negotiate incredible pricing terms to further lower our costs, enabling higher context lengths and a better experience for all of you.

## Putting it all together

We've gone deep on the heartbeat of Latitude, a constant focus on how we can deliver more user value. We've also shared how we set up our AI architecture to enable that. Now let's summarize how that has all come together to make double context possible.

In short, to support giving everyone double context, we needed to find a way to sustainably support (roughly) 2x AI costs. We did that in a few ways:

- We architected AI Dungeon to be provider agnostic, allowing us to find the best providers at the cheapest prices, especially as new models and providers have come out in the past few months.
- We leveraged the high traffic volume of AI Dungeon to negotiate discounted pricing on AI compute (so we could give that back to all of you)
- By being model agnostic, we're able to evaluate and deploy the highest quality and most affordable models
- We're passing these cost savings on to you by providing double context length for each tier, for no additional charge.
- These changes will still allow us to operate sustainably, ensuring AI Dungeon will be around for the foreseeable future

As we mentioned earlier, this is the first time we've shared some of these details publicly. Please let us know if you enjoyed this post, and we can share more updates like this in the future. We're incredibly grateful for your feedback and support, and we are working hard to give you more and more value in AI Dungeon.","True","False","True","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","45506","public","None","self","None","None","How We Gave Players 2x Context on AI Dungeon","None","0","[]","168","0.97","https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/1chr12s/how_we_gave_players_2x_context_on_ai_dungeon/","[]","None","False","None","None","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","self","False","[{""id"": ""Sh4Omn_EL0nUgeQiRMCkUoL4HAWxLtUrolYx5bZ8Peo"", ""resolutions"": [{""height"": 54, ""url"": ""https://external-preview.redd.it/kum-CP4af_dVzO2W6vkRMd79CAd5Is5KLvLm_A3YVh4.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=873eb9db5d50d0c0cf08ed02e5b75cc4bbc2bc4a"", ""width"": 108}, {""height"": 108, ""url"": ""https://external-preview.redd.it/kum-CP4af_dVzO2W6vkRMd79CAd5Is5KLvLm_A3YVh4.jpg?width=216&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=aa8c438521c8e1f4faae3a22728c13e3f3f7313b"", ""width"": 216}, {""height"": 160, ""url"": ""https://external-preview.redd.it/kum-CP4af_dVzO2W6vkRMd79CAd5Is5KLvLm_A3YVh4.jpg?width=320&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=5c9e36a89e02270b3ab9565bbd6faf698e9e145c"", ""width"": 320}, {""height"": 320, ""url"": ""https://external-preview.redd.it/kum-CP4af_dVzO2W6vkRMd79CAd5Is5KLvLm_A3YVh4.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=3cf0c75b530aa0709bcff8769408e547a6006fac"", ""width"": 640}], ""source"": {""height"": 360, ""url"": ""https://external-preview.redd.it/kum-CP4af_dVzO2W6vkRMd79CAd5Is5KLvLm_A3YVh4.jpg?auto=webp&s=4a47a97e256ae097f2262e891c5ce8aa7973256c"", ""width"": 720}, ""variants"": {}}]","True"

What does that have to do with AIDungeon? 
When you create a private story, and I underline PRIVATE, you're still subjected to safety settings and word afiltering. If you ask to the AI it tells that is to protect you. Yes, you read correctly: to protect you by yourself...

I had a couple of suggestions/requests that I think would really improve the functionality of AIDungeon:

1. Updated & uncensored image generation models.

2. Use the image generators to attach images to story cards.

3. A way to ask the AI questions? For example if it tells me I walk in a room, I'd love to ask it to describe the room to me without that causing the narrative of the adventure to progress.

4. A way to pin images generated so that we don't need to scroll up a ton in adventures to find ones we made a while back.

Most of the ideas are around the image generation functionality as I find it super cool, however it's difficult to justify using it, as after I use it the images come out looking odd more often then not, and then they get buried very quickly in the stories. Having to scroll for 5 min up to find what a specific character I met a day ago looks like really pulls me out of the immersion.","True","False","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","45580","public","None","self","None","None","Some suggestions/requests","None","0","[]","4","0.84","https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/1cipna1/some_suggestionsrequests/","[]","None","False","None","None","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I have been creating a new scenario, and while trying to test the scripting behavior across multiple platforms, I noticed some odd behavior. When I create an adventure from the scenario with custom scripting on mobile, none of the scripts work, regardless of how long I engage with the adventure. If I create the exact same adventure (i.e using the exact same starting parameters) on desktop, all scripts work correctly. In addition, I can run the adventure created on desktop using mobile, and the scripts will now work correctly. Furthermore, if I run the adventure created on mobile using desktop at least once, the scripts begin working correctly for that adventure. Even when I switch back to mobile, the scripts now work correctly for that adventure originally created on mobile.

All this seems to indicate with fairly high certainty that there is a bug in which adventures created on mobile fail to do an initial load of custom scripts for the source scenario. This may be connected to the fact that AI Dungeon does not allow modification of scripts on mobile, but I'm honestly not sure beyond that.

Let me state this more formally below:

## 🧑 Story:
As a user, I want custom scripts created for the source scenario adventure to work regardless of the platform I create the adventure on.

## 🚩 Problem:
Adventures created on mobile do not use custom scripts from the source scenario unless accessed at least once on desktop.

## 📝 Steps to reproduce:
* Create a new scenario and implement an easily reproducible script (e.g returning `{stop: true}` from the `input` hook upon a particular user input).
* Create new adventure from scenario on desktop and confirm that script runs correctly.
* Create new adventure from scenario on mobile and confirm that script does not run correctly.
* (Optional) Run mobile-created adventure on desktop, confirm that script runs correctly, then run the same adventure on mobile, and confirm that script now runs correctly.

## 📱 Environment Specifications
#### Desktop:
Windows 11 Pro, Google Chrome 124.0.6367.119 (Official Build) (64 bit)
#### Mobile:
iPhone 11, iOS version 17.4.1

## 🔨 Acceptance Criteria:
* Adventures created on mobile properly load and utilize custom scripts from the source scenario.
* If the custom scripts for the source scenario are updated, adventures created on mobile should utilize those updates without requiring a one-time access on desktop.","True","False","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","45598","public","None","self","None","None","Custom scripts for mobile-created adventure are not utilized until adventure is run on desktop","None","0","[]","6","1","https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/1cjqg3h/custom_scripts_for_mobilecreated_adventure_are/","[]","None","False","None","None","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I am using a ""Multiple Choice"" start for a new scenario I'm working on, and I wanted to explore improving the consistency of the experience using the AI Instructions beta feature. However, while custom AI Instructions work well for a basic ""Story"" start, they do not persist when added for a ""Multiple Choice"" start.

Let me state this more formally below:

## 🧑 Story:
As a user, I want to be able to set AI Instructions for one or more of the choices defined in my ""Multiple Choice"" start for a custom scenario.

## 🚩 Problem:
While AI Instructions can be added and modified on choices for a ""Multiple Choice"" start, once the user navigates away from the page where they are set, the content is not saved, leaving a blank field. This causes no AI Instructions to be sent at all, ruining the behavior of adventures based on the scenario.

## 📝 Steps to reproduce:
1. Navigate to https://beta.aidungeon.com/
2. Create a new scenario using the ""Multiple Choice"" start.
3. Click ""Configure"" on one or more of the choices, click ""Add Plot Component"" on the resulting menu, and select ""AI Instructions"" from the dropdown.
4. Add some AI Instructions (could be anything, but basing it off of the default instructions with some small change will be most demonstrative).
5. Finish the setup and navigate away from the page.
6. Go back to the scenario and edit it, navigating back to the choice that you configured in step 3.
7. Observe that the AI Instructions field is now unset.
8. (Optional) Create an adventure based off of the scenario, run a command, and observe that the AI Instructions are missing from the processed command context using ""View Instructions"".

Additionally, the values that could be chosen for one input sometimes depended on the value chosen in the first input, so this seemed like a natural fit. To give an example of what I mean by that, imagine users are presented with three multiple choice questions in succession: “What country are you from?”, “What city are you from in that country?”, “What district are you from in that city?”. The available choices for question 2 depend on the choice in question 1, and so too question 3 depends on question 2. There’s no meaningful way to mimic this cascading choice dependence with another start, as far as I’m aware.

However, using this setup means that each unique combination of choices must be maintained individually! That means that if I find a missing period in my start description (mostly shared amongst all choices), I need to update that missing period for every single combination.

I was a free user of Ai Dungeon for a while, but I switched to NovelAI when everything was at rock bottom. So far that has been pretty good, though it seems the AI art is getting more attention, and I'm personally not as keen on that stuff.

Recenty however, I've been hearing that AI Dungeon has been greatly improved in overall quality and was thinking of coming back and buying the 15 dollar subscription.

Before I do however, I wanted to ask the community one final time exactly how Ai Dungeon compares to Novel Ai, at least the 15 dollar subscriptions for both. Is it that really much superior in quality and memory? I know it has 8k token context, but not much else.

--

A decade after a plague wiped out New England's men, Greg Shaw, Overseer of Vault 77, emerges from cryo-stasis, to bear the heavy responsibility for the safety and welfare of its residents.

Greg Shaw, a fair man of remarkable integrity, stands tall and rugged, commanding respect throughout the vault. At 50, his muscles still ripple beneath his worn vault suit, a testament to years of survival in the harsh post-apocalyptic world. 

Greg bears the burden of running the vault while also managing complex relationships, fighting to maintain a reserved and aloof professional demeanor while residents actively pursue his attention and affection.

Surrounded by rumors of peculiar events and unexplained vanishings, Greg detects trouble on the horizon. Amidst the unfolding chaos, he stumbles upon hidden systems within his Overseer computer - the power to influence emotions through the Pip-boy worn by residents. Will this newfound ability safeguard the vault's integrity or fracture the community's bonds of trust?

Greg is entangled in secrecy, testing loyalties and forging alliances in private. Amidst encroaching outsiders and lurking dangers within the vault, Greg must navigate cautiously to prevent unleashing uncontrollable forces.

In the shadows of Vault 77, a tale of survival, desire, and betrayal unfolds, where the Last Man Standing holds the key to salvation or destruction.

**-This story -**

Following the popularity of the Witch of Gould Hill, this story features 28 characters and 44 locations, multiple story branching paths.I have included AI instructions. If you want to test this story on the beta website, the results will vary.

- Made for 3rd person.

- Add author notes for plot and relationship landmarks, such as:\\[Emily wants Greg's help with her book\\]

Cards exist for locations. Statements like, ""Greg meets Aurora at the lounge."" load context for the room and character.

Ver. notes in comments.—-----# Creative Project Update: Last Man Standing

**## Project Overview**

""Last Man Standing"" serves as my second venture into the realm of crafting an epic tale. Encouraged by the enthusiastic reception and constructive feedback garnered by my earlier work, ""The Witch of Gould Hill,"" I embarked on this project with a desire to amplify both cohesion and drama within this sci-fi narrative.

**The Witch of Gould Manor v6.0 - Failure**

Having faced initial setbacks, I am now dedicated to refining and enhancing the storytelling aspects. 

I am aware of the eager anticipation from fans awaiting the next version of ""The Witch at Gould Hill."" Engaging in open conversations on platforms like Reddit and forums, I have shared my vision to introduce a scripted, sophisticated character arc system capable of handling romances and mysteries.

As I've written many times, the problem with artificial intelligence is that the moment you tell it something, it wants to reveal that element. If what you have told is part of a mystery plot or a secret to be uncovered, the AI absolutely loses its mind trying to figure out how quickly it can tell you the secrets.   


Generally, characters will openly announce private concerns and secrets. Characters you've just met will either try to sleep with you or give you their most prized possessions.I reached out to the AI Dungeon community and shared my disappointments and aspirations. I am so thankful to all of the truly brilliant individuals who responded to my requests with guidance, code examples, patience, and serious enthusiasm, which kept me going through this long and arduous process.

With help, I attempted to create a character arc system that would naturally track the amount, quality, and type of interactions that a user would have with a character and tabulate points at different tiers. 

    friendship:   {level: 1, cost:2, points:0, plateau:5, active:1, progression:'romance'},                             romance:      {level: 0, cost:7, points:0, plateau:5, active:0, progression:'physical'},                             physical:     {level: 0, cost:5, points:0, plateau:5, active:0, progression:''},                             
    skill:        {level: 0, cost:5, points:0, plateau:5, active:1, progression:''},                             
    corruption:   {level: 0, cost:5, points:0, plateau:5, active:1, progression:''},                             
    submission:   {level: 0, cost:3, points:0, plateau:5, active:1, progression:''},                             
    arousal:      {level: 1, cost:2, points:0, plateau:5, active:1, progression:'physical'},

Different affectations, pieces of information, and relationship dynamics would then begin to emerge as a character's connection to the player increased. As the number and type of interactions between the user and the non-player characters took place, I would look for keywords in conversations. I would map them to an array of words that would indicate progress in an emotional direction. Once enough progress was made in that direction by scoring points, tracking them, and then reaching a new level plateau, I would programmatically load different character cards for the emotional direction that changed how the character functioned and what they knew.For instance, I would look for parts of the following trigger words around romantic activities in sentences that were either output from the AI or input by the user.

Triggers romance:      \\['flirt', 'kiss', 'makeout', 'date', 'danc', 'romant', 'attract', 'beauti', 'togeth', 'flatter',\\],

Every time one of these was hit, it would score a point. There were a number of points in a level, and when you went up a level, instead of loading the Romance 00 card, I would then load the Romance 01 card, and so on, with the character progressing, as you can see in the below cards.

VALGOULD-romance00Valerie is indifferent to Greg Shaw. While Valerie finds him intriguing, she doesn't see him romantically. Valerie might playfully tease him, but it's all in good fun. Greg notices Valerie's friendly demeanor but no romantic interest yet.

VALGOULD-romance04Valerie decides to take a risk with Greg. Valerie confesses Valerie's feelings and the challenges Valerie faces due to Valerie's past. Valerie may express Valerie's desire for a committed but open relationship, fearing intimacy but seeking connection. Valerie starts to flirt openly and may drop hints of physical attraction, but full romance is not yet embraced.

When any character entered a scene, their “base” character card would load with basic details, but 7 additional cards would be loaded with their current levels of emotional state.There was also a series of generic emotional level cards that could be used for characters that did not have a specific character arc tied to a specific emotional direction.

I worked on this system for more than three months, even with the limited number of characters in The Witch of Gould Manor. Each character had 7 personality criteria, and each criterion had 5 levels. So, every character ended up having 35 stages of character attribute development. This quickly escalated the number of cards needed to around 455 character cards, not including locations. 

Even after finishing this work and testing it out, the system simply could not manage the complexity of an evolving relationship. There were also shortcomings in my writing. It was difficult to ensure that as a relationship expanded, the shared information and emotional connection progressed in a clear and linear way. It became challenging when I had to expand on story elements and facts at each of the 5 levels so that they would create a dynamic relationship. 

In addition, no matter how much structure I put around a character's actions using these scripted prompts,  I still had to constantly throttle the creativity of the AI engine. Even when characters were clearly defined as just being at friendship level 2, the AI would creatively skyrocket them to jump into bed, which didn't make any sense. I ended up spending so much time telling the AI what characters would not do at certain levels that writing just stopped being fun.

**##AI and the failure to understand character arc:**

It's my opinion that this is the great shortcoming of AI Dungeon. Like all of you, I have been closely following the developments of the HERO system and the improved memory system. These are very important, and I don't want to downplay their significance. Any writer can tell you that the plot is just a device to explore your characters, and every great story is about the evolving relationship between characters. Tracking evolving relationships is the biggest missing piece in AI storytelling. AI fundamentally does not understand how relationships progress and how the ebb and flow of relationships drive everything else in a story.

While it is entirely true that memory plays a pivotal role in User story investment because, and I agree with the lead developers, when an NPC forgets a major event or an important interaction, it undermines the story and removes your ability to suspend disbelief. 

However, what really troubles me is when characters that I have barely met confide information that they should not or pursue physical interactions that feel completely inappropriate. Tracking character affinity and emotional connection to the user is the most important part of any story. Read any book on writing, and they will say that the plot is the least important. Readers don't care about the plot. They care about the characters. The plot is just the things that happen along the way as we learn more about the characters. 

A character needs to start emotionally in one place and end the story emotionally in a different place, with a new realization about their place in the world or a changed sense of an internal value that they held rigid. These character arcs define successful storytelling, and every bad movie you've ever seen has characters that don't develop.

I tried to address these concerns by compartmentalizing information from my characters until they had enough interaction with the user and by segregating feelings and interaction possibilities until the characters had reached a certain plateau. This might still be possible, but for now, the complexity is beyond my ability to develop.

Trying to recreate ""The Witch of Gold Manor"" with a character experience/character arc system took a long time and produced very poor results. After putting in that tremendous effort, I stepped back from the platform for a little bit, waiting for the HERO system to come out and perhaps solve some of the issues. 

With some of the new AI model announcements, I decided that I would try a different path. Since so many people had fallen in love with the characters in ""The Witch of Gould Hill,"" I decided to try to make a new story that was not a mystery but could involve the same type of complicated character interactions that the story was able to create. ##Fallout: Last Man Standing

With this beta release of “Last Man Standing,” I feel I am 75% of the way there. I've been waiting too long to release this because I wanted to make it perfect after my last failure. But I realize that I've just been sitting on it when the reality is I need to get these stories out because the best feedback I get will come from all of you.""Last Man Standing"" is chock-full of potential wild character interaction. There are a lot of really interesting scenarios baked into the different characters.

The last piece that I am still working on is the inter-character intrigue because in any close-knit group of individuals, like the vault dwellers, you're going to have a lot of agendas and history driving what happens. I tried to capture that, but I still have a ways to go.

I have also seen a code example that allows you to inject plot events at certain durations in the story that I may consider adding to this. But that will be a while down the road. As always, I welcome feedback and suggestions from all of you.

**## WGM and thank you**

If anyone would like to collaborate with me on this story or if someone who is much better at coding than I am wants to look through ""The Witch of Gold Manor"" and figure out where I have made disastrous mistakes, I invite that as well.

I intend to post an article outlining the entirety of ""The Witch of Gold Manor"" development so that, once again, smarter people than I can perhaps take this concept and make it work.

I'm excited about the AI writing community and amazed by the wonderfully supportive and generous people on this platform. I cannot stress enough that of these stories would never have seen the light of day without the support of many of you. I would like to specifically thank a few individuals who have been extraordinarily patient and supportive despite my numerous exhausting and frustrating questions.

Thank you, Dragranis, Randy Viosca, RaguMan, Onyx

Embark on an epic journey into the realms of alchemy, rituals, and ancient powers as you navigate the treacherous path of becoming a Beyonder. In a world where potions hold the key to unlocking extraordinary abilities, you must carefully research formulas, gather rare ingredients, and craft powerful concoctions.



But beware, for with great power comes great risk. Each potion you consume shapes your very existence, altering your flesh and mind in profound ways. Advance through the sequence levels cautiously, lest you succumb to the madness that befalls those who tread recklessly.



Engage in battles against formidable foes, honing your combat skills and unleashing devastating attacks, dodges, and healing techniques. Forge alliances or sever ties as you navigate a world teetering on the brink of apocalypse, where your choices shape the fate of countless souls.



Unravel the mysteries of sequence affiliated rituals, conducting arcane ceremonies that grant you access to powers beyond mortal comprehension.



In this immersive and perilous realm, every decision you make holds the power to shape your destiny. Will you ascend to become a true Deity, wielding unfathomable might, or will you succumb to the darkness that lurks within? The choice is yours, but the consequences will echo through eternity.



Prepare yourself for an unforgettable odyssey, where the boundaries of reality bend to your will, and the line between power and madness blurs with each step you take. Welcome to the world of Beyonders – a realm where legends are forged, and the fate of existence hangs in the balance.



Based on the Books ""Lord of the Mysteries"" and ""Circle of Inevitability"" by Cuttlefish That Loves Diving

* Fixed an issue where the Context Viewer would sometimes show a total context less than what was selected in your Advanced Settings
* Fixed an issue where the Context Viewer wasn’t available after retrying an action
* Fixed an issue where buffer tokens weren’t being accurately represented in the Context Viewer. Buffer tokens help the AI models function properly when reaching their maximum model context.
* We have retired the old Inspect Input in favor of the Context Viewer. Pressing ""Inspect Input"" will now open the Context Viewer instead.
* Changing the Context Length slider in Advanced Settings should now dynamically change credit cost if applicable
* Fixed an issue where players’ Response Length setting wasn’t respected
* Fixed an issue where the Temperature slider was showing inaccurate maximum values
* Fixed an issue where Presence Penalty and Frequency Penalty weren't working as expected for Llama 3 70B
* Set the default Temperature for Llama 3 70B to 0.9 to help with repetition issues
* We reviewed player settings and adjusted some game-breaking values back to their defaults. This included resetting Temperatures above 2 to 0.9.
* Fixed an issue where some Mythic players couldn’t access the Dalle image models
* Fixed an issue where some players had their CFG scale set to 30 under the Image Generator Advanced Settings, which caused decreased image quality on Stable Diffusion models
* Removed the image sampler dropdown under the Image Generator Advanced Settings. AI Dungeon uses simple image generation, so while it appeared that you could change the sampler, in reality, only DDIM was being used.
* Fixed an issue where the message body was hidden in the notifications popup menu on iOS and Android
* Added a 100,000 character limit to Memory for technical stability and player flexibility
* When your currently selected AI engine is not available, you should now be switched to one that is
* Speed Boosts with Scales should now work for MythoMax and Tiefighter (free players only)
* A number of players have unintentionally been using Griffin. Because of this, we have switched players currently on Griffin to MythoMax. Anyone who still wants to use Griffin can switch back under the in-game settings.
* Our payment provider, Stripe, no longer supports pausing subscriptions. This may be offered again in the future, but it isn’t possible through Stripe at this time. You can still pause subscriptions started through Apple or Google Play.

First, what exactly are the story cards? How do they differ from the memory? When should use then instead of memory?

I know for short time things memory work, like what the player is wearing who are his/her companions at the moment, etc.

But for more long term things, like player discription, where he lives, how is his house, the other characters discription. This things can fill a lot space in the memory. Should I use story cards?

I tend to have fairly long stories most of the time and create numerous story cards.

However, there are stretches were some cards simply aren't relevant but, they're used an prioritized over cards that would matter more.

So, I was wondering if there could be an option that would allow us to either activate/decative story card for a story, or if that's not an option, to sort by priority?

At the moment, the only available option seems to be to delete them entirely... which really isn't a great option.","True","False","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","45712","public","None","self","None","None","Options to deactivate story cards?","None","0","[]","8","0.91","https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/1cop859/options_to_deactivate_story_cards/","[]","None","False","None","None","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

i'm an ""Adventurer"" since few days, and i wondered if there is something i can do with this level of subscription to make the AI keeping in mind some things i go through. For example i saved a town of thieves, and helped rebuilt the village, and i tried to use the sentence ""your hear a scream outside the house in the middle of the night and"" ... and it's always thieves coming back. is there a way to indicate the AI to not repeat same events twice ? 

Also i was a ranger and i hunted a legendary werewolf, i was known in all the kingdom for this action, and some days after (talking and doing stuff in the town), someone told me to f\\*\\*\\* off, and i asked him how can he talk to me that way and it seems all the people forgot it. 

So my question : is there something to be done at my subscription level. And if i upgrad my subscription (legend/champion) is the Ai going to be better at keeping things in mind natively ? 

Thanks a lot for your input !

The reason for this is that I don't think linearly, this can be difficult when dealing with a text adventure that requires inputs come one after the other, as often times I get stuck and find myself unable to continue an adventure.

This is where my suggestion of a few storytelling tools alongside the main ask scenes and an outline and table of contents. I know if anything like this was ever planned it's a long way out and I have been happy with the progress of the game, but things can always be better. first let's discuss the outline.

The outline will do two things, it will allow you to write context and organize scenes. An outline will contain lore, characters, items, locations, in otherwords the story cards, 
And it will contain and allow you to organize and create scenes.

Next let's describe a scene. A scene is like a mini scenario. When a scene is created you can create a prompt for the scene, describe what the goal of the scene is and select the context of the scene such as location and characters as well as previous scenes. When a scene is completed you will be able to write a summarization of all the important info within. The context of the scene will allow you to manually select specific scenes and story cards to fill the context. If generic love interest (Gli for short) isn't relevant to your climactic rematch with edgy rival you simply don't select the scenes or story cards she was a focus in. Having a lovers quarrel with Gli, then don't select your fight scenes with edgy rival. Since ideally you would be able to select characters within a scene and manually alter the context you could play as a character other than you, and have multiple scenes technically happen at the same time.

Lastly would be the table of contents. Simply a list of the scenes for easy access, completed scenes will allow you to read and edit, progressing scenes will allow you to play.

This is ultimately what I have found myself wanting in a storytelling tool lately. A way to technically work on developing my adventure into a living breathing world, where I can expand the world when I get stuck trying to progress through the story in hopes of finding inspiration for new action. I hope that my idea is at least possible, and ideally helpful.

* Added an indicator for Scenarios under the Details tab that shows how many tokens your Plot Components will take up in players’ Adventures. Known issue: this isn’t working for Multiple Choice Scenarios yet, but it will be soon.
* You can now click or tap on a number under Advanced Settings to type in a new value and adjust the sliders. Known issue: to set a decimal point number, you must type a whole number and then add a decimal between numbers. This is on our list to fix.

Since the early days of Large Language Models (LLMs), we’ve worked hard to use the most advanced models in the world for AI Dungeon. We’ve seen incredible advances in the power of these models, especially in the past 6 months. We’d like to share more about how we think about AI Models at AI Dungeon, including the entire lifecycle of selection, evaluation, deployment, and retirement. This should answer some questions we’ve seen in the community about the decisions we make and what you can expect from models in AI Dungeon in the future.

# Large Language Models + AI Dungeon: A History Lesson

AI Dungeon was born when our founder, Nick Walton, saw the launch of OpenAI’s GPT2 model and wondered if it could become a dynamic storyteller (just like in Dungeons and Dragons).

Spoiler: it worked! 🎉

A hackathon prototype turned into an infinite AI-powered game unlike anything before. From the very first few days, the cost of running an AI-powered game became readily apparent. The first version of AI Dungeon cost $10,000/day to run (so much that the university hosting the first version had to shut it down after 3 days!). Thus began our constant quest to identify and implement affordable and capable AI models so that anyone could play AI Dungeon.

The first public version of AI Dungeon (in December 2019) was powered by GPT-2. Later, we switched to using GPT-3 through OpenAI (in 2020). While it was exciting to be using the state-of-the-art AI tech at that time, unlike today, there were essentially no other competitive AI models, commercial or open source. We couldn’t just switch models if issues arose (and they certainly did). When you asked us for cheaper options or unlimited play, we didn’t have the leverage to advocate for lower costs for you since there was no competition creating price pressure.

But that was all about to change. New open-source and commercial models entered the market, and we explored them as they became available. The open-source GPT-J (summer of 2021) and GPT-NeoX were promising, and AI21’s Jurassic models (Fall of 2021) were explored over the next few years. Fast-forward to today, there are hundreds of models and model variants. AI Dungeon is uniquely positioned to leverage new advances in AI from various providers at scale.

Given the number of available models, picking which models to check out can be tricky. Evaluating and deploying models takes time. Here are some of the ways we think about this process:

# Our Strategy for AI Models

We’ve made a few choices that impact how we handle AI model work in AI Dungeon. Together, these allow us to give you the best role-play experience we can.

1. **Model Agnostic**. We’ve chosen to be model agnostic so you have access to the best models on the market and benefit from the billions of dollars currently being invested into better models by multiple companies. You’ve seen the fruit of this strategy lately with the launch of MythoMax, Tie Fighter, Mixtral 7x8B, GPT-4-Turbo, Llama 3 70B, and WizardLM 8x22B. \\[Read More\\]
2. **Vendor Agnostic.** We’ve also chosen to be vendor agnostic so you benefit from the competition among current providers. The recent doubling in context length was possible because of this. \\[Read More\\]
3. **Operate Profitably**. Given the scale of AI Dungeon, we could bankrupt the company very easily if we weren’t careful. We spend a lot of time thinking about AI cost to ensure AI Dungeon will be around for a long time. Our goal is to give as much as possible to you without putting the future of AI Dungeon at risk.
4. **Iterate Quickly**. We’ve designed our technology, team, and models around fast learning and iteration. The recent rise of instruction-based models means models can be quickly adapted to the AI Dungeon experience without needing to create (or wait for) a fine-tuned model suited for role-play adventures.
5. **Enable endless play**. We want to offer models that allow you to play how you want. Outside of a few edge cases (such as sexual content involving minors and guidelines for publicly published content shared with our community), we want you to go on epic adventures, slay dragons, and explore worlds without constraint. Because of our model/vendor agnostic strategy, we have the flexibility to ensure we get to control the approach. \\[Read more about this strategy in our blog post about the Walls Approach\\].

# How We Identify New Models to Evaluate

At first, we evaluated every model that launched. Early providers included OpenAI, Cohere, AI21, and Eleuther. Lately, we haven’t been able to keep up with the rate of new models being launched. Here’s one visualization of just how the AI Model space has accelerated.

[Cumulative count of repos by category over time. Source: https:\\/\\/www.linkedin.com\\/pulse\\/stable-evolution-open-source-ai-michael-spencer-oefhc\\/](https://preview.redd.it/h5dtnibt6n0d1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=83ebaba03a13662e55247ddfafeba27633368f4a)

We’re selective about which models to evaluate. We base that decision on information we source from the AI community on X, LLM leaderboards, our technology partners, and members of our AI Dungeon community.

When a model piques our interest and seems like it could be worth exploring (when it could have a desirable combo of cost/latency/quality/etc), we do some light exploration around feasibility and desirability. If there’s a playground where we can test the model, we’ll play around a bit ourselves to see what we think. We also talk to our current providers to see how/when they may offer a model at scale.

If everything seems positive, we move into our model evaluation process.

# How We Evaluate AI Models

Once we’ve identified a model we are interested in, then the real evaluation starts. Here are the steps we take to verify if a model is worth offering to you in AI Dungeon:

1. Research. As mentioned in the selection process, we look to a number of sources, including industry benchmarks, leaderboards and discussion in the broader AI community, for indicators of which models are the most promising.
2. Playground testing. Someone on our team experiments to confirm we think it could work with AI Dungeon.
3. Finetuning (if required). GPT-J (which powers Griffin) and AI21 Mid (which powers Dragon) are examples of models that clearly needed fine-tuning to perform well for AI Dungeon. Newer models have been able to perform well without finetuning.
4. Integrate the model into AI Dungeon and make sure it works. For example, we recently evaluated a model (Smaug) that seemed compelling on paper but wasn’t able to generate coherent outputs due to its inability to handle the action/response format we use in AI Dungeon.
5. Internal testing. Does the model behave as we expect it to with AI Dungeon’s systems? For instance, when we first implemented ChatGPT, it became clear that we’d need additional safety systems to minimize the impact of the model’s moralizing behavior.
6. Alpha testing. Our community alpha testers help us find issues and give a qualitative sense of how good the model is. The models from Google didn’t make it past our Alpha testers due to moralizing and lower quality writing than competing models.
7. AI Comparison. Players who opt into the “Improve the AI” setting are occasionally presented with two AI outputs and asked to select the best one. These outputs are from two different models, and we compare how often one model’s responses are preferred over another’s. To achieve statistical significance for the test, we collect a few thousand responses per AI Comparison.
8. Experimental access. The final step is giving you all access to the new models in an experimental phase. We often make significant adjustments to how we handle models as a result of the feedback you share. In some cases, models may not be promoted past the experimental phase if players aren’t finding value from them. For instance, we’re considering whether to promote Llama 3 70B since players have reported it repeats frequently.

At any step of the process, we may decide to stop evaluation. Most models don’t make it through our evaluation process to become an offered model on AI Dungeon.

# How We Deploy Models

Once we commit to offering a model on AI Dungeon, we then figure out the best way to run it at scale. With private models we often can only run them with the creator of the model (like AI21’s models). For open-source models, we can choose between running on rented hardware or using other providers that run LLMs as a service (which is our preference). [By optimizing our model deployment costs we’re able to deliver better AI to users for the same price.](https://blog.latitude.io/all-posts/how-we-gave-players-2x-context-on-ai-dungeon)

We also have an alert system and series of dashboards that show us the number of requests, average context in and out, latency profiling (average request time, max request time), and estimated cost. This lets us keep our AI models running smoothly and quickly respond to any issues that come up.

# How We Retire Models

Given the complexity of models, it’s sometimes necessary to retire models that are no longer adding much value to the community. While it would be nice to offer every AI model perpetually, maintaining models takes time and development resources away from other improvements on AI Dungeon, including new AI models and systems.

Because of that, we need to balance the value a model provides against the cost of maintaining it (especially in developer time). We’re guessing most of you are no longer pining for the good old days of GPT-2 😉.

Before deciding to retire a model, we consider usage, tech advances (i.e., instruction-based models), latency, uptime, stability, error rates, costs, player feedback, and the general state of models in AI Dungeon (i.e., how many do we have for each tier).

Each model is unique, like an ice cream flavor. Taking away your favorite flavor can be frustrating, especially if that model does things that other models don’t (like mid-sentence completion). We hope there’s solace in the fact that when models are retired, the recovered development resources are reinvested into better models and new features that make AI Dungeon a better experience for you.

Today here’s the % breakdown of model usage for various models:

# Free Players

MythoMax 73%

TieFighter 17.8%

Mixtral 8.8%

Griffin 0.4%

# Subscribers

Mixtral 79%

MythoMax 8%

WizardLM 8x22B 5%

TieFighter 4%

Llama 3 70B 2%

Dragon 1%

GPT-4-Turbo 0.5%

ChatGPT 0.4%

Griffin 0.01%

You’ll notice a few things. MythoMax is our most popular model, even capturing some use from paid players who have access to all the models. Mixtral is the clear favorite for premium players.

Because of the advances in tech as well as low usage, we will be retiring Griffin, Dragon, and ChatGPT models on May 31st, 2024. Griffin, while it’s served us well, has exceptionally low usage, the worst uptime of all our models, and a high rate of errors. It requires more developer maintenance than all other models we offer. Dragon and ChatGPT also have lower usage now. Retiring models enables us to focus on other product work including additional model improvements, bug fixing, and building new features.

GPT-4-Turbo is somewhat of an outlier. Despite its moralizing, it’s one of the best story writing models available. Players who use it love it! While its usage rate is low relative to other models, it’s actually well represented for a model only available to Legend and Mythic tiers, though it’s clear players still favor Llama 3 70B and WizardLM 8x22B. We are evaluating the recently announced GPT-4o as a potential replacement for GPT-4 Turbo which could mean offering higher context lengths. Although venture-funded OpenAI says they’ll offer limited use of GPT-4o for free through their own ChatGPT client, it will not be a free model for API users (like AI Dungeon), so it will still be a premium model for us. First, though, it needs to pass the evaluations we’ve outlined above.

# Moving Forward

This was a deeper peek into our approach to models than we’ve ever given. We hope it’s clear that we spend a lot of time thinking about which models we can offer to you and how to provide them best.

Thank you to all who have given feedback on our AI models. We will continue to communicate as much as we can about models and planned model improvements.

Basically, let's say I'm facing off with a guy, and I try to examine his fighting stance to get a feel of who I'm dealing with. The AI examines him just fine, but then it just keeps going and does stuff I don't want to do, eg throw an unprompted punch or speak. The writing is still really good, but id rather it just stop when I want it to, so I can choose my next move.

Another thing is that ""Retry"" should be called ""Rephrase"" since it does the same thing with different wording. I have done 40 refreshes and it continues to say ""Sarah walks up to you"" in different ways. I have in memory (plot essentials) that Sarah died. On top of that, she died only six actions ago so it's still in the adventure. The AI refuses to budge no matter what I do. 

Things I've tried:

Rewording, completely rewriting, many memory changes, banning words, Author's note, erasing all the way back to the death and trying again with different wording, hitting the retry button 40 times. 

I switched to the other available AI at one point, but I didn't have as much token space and it couldn't get some context I needed. 

I'm noticing the disregard to plot essentials on my other stories too. It just blatantly chooses not to use it at all. I'm super frustrated, I'm basically locked out of using it with all this work and halting.

If there's nothing else I can do, I'm just dropping off of AIDungeon. I don't have any money to get a subscription and I don't want to pay just to play the game.

after my Mythic just ran out a few days ago and Llama has been my go-to model, I decided to only renew to Champion tier to save some money.

The thought behind that was that I could 'only' use 8k context length with Llama anyway and I was getting annoyed by Mixtral's repetitions.

I went into my story and saw that Llama could now only use a maximum of 2k context length.

Dunno if I was naive to think that with Champion tier I could still use the 8k from before, but here I am.

  
This is not a big cry for a refund or an outrage.

To put it in perspective, DeepInfra only charges $0.65 per 1 million tokens for WizardLM-2-8x22B, with full context length. Whereas 1 million input tokens for AI Dungeon at 64k context length would cost over $10 in credits.

I can appreciate that there's more that goes into AI Dungeon than just the AI models, and they may be using a different provider that charges more, but there's such a large disparity between providers that it's hard to ignore.

* Fixed an issue where Multiple Choice Scenarios didn't have the Plot Component token indicator
* Fixed an issue in the mobile apps where the Retry popup menu would be larger than the screen
* The Retry popup menu will now scroll if the output exceeds the size of the menu
* The “AI Safety Settings” section has been renamed to “Safety Settings” on the Account Settings screen
* Fixed an issue that was causing missing spaces at the beginning of Tiefighter and MythoMax outputs
* Fixed an issue where the Context Viewer and settings sidebar were showing data about the new memory system when they shouldn’t have. Known Issues: “Memory” is blue in the Context Viewer bar graph but green in the key and details. Also, its “View Tokens” button isn’t formatted correctly but should still work as expected.

**Thank you for your patience as we wrap up other updates for AI Drop #3!**

**Intro**

Large language models roughly work by taking the input and giving a likely output. It determines this likely output by vast amounts of training data in the English language. Out of this data, there are words that are more common than others.

The word “feel” turns out to be very common, especially when the ai instructions has the words “dungeon master”. This makes the phrase “You can’t help but feel a sense of” very common. This is worsened by the fact that, once that set of words is spoken, it is more likely to be repeated again and again.

How do we mitigate this? See the following examples:

**Bad prompt**

Story: You are an Emerson, an explorer.

You enter a dark temple hidden inside a mountain. You make your way to the treasure room.

AI Instructions: Default

This vague prompt forces the ai to fill in most of the words. Undoubtedly “Feel” is generated and your whole story is now plagued by “You feel a sense of”

The solution is to provide the ai a large amount of tokens that makes “feel” less likely to appear.

**Better Prompt**

Story: You are an Emerson, an explorer.

You enter a dark temple hidden inside a mountain. You make your way to the treasure room.

Backstory: There was an explorer named Jen that once enetered a temple. They climbed a mountain to enter and carefully walked on the marble floor.

The temple had many traps, including trap doors, arrows, and spikes.

Author’s note: Focus on the location’s description. (For example:temple,ruin,crack,spike,stone,brick,slab,vines,light,dark,electric,ornate,dilapidated,detail,pattern,sequence,path,maze,winding)

AI instructions: Default

Here the backstory provides a rough guide to future story generation. Avoid using emotion words.

The ai instructions contain many words that are associated with ruins and temple. These words make it very likely that other words associated with ruins and temple appear. This significantly reduces the probability of “you feel” appearing in your story.

The last step is to crank up your top k to at least 200. This lets the ai have more words to pick from, further reducing the probability of “you feel” appearing.

Make sure that you retry if “feel” appears.

**Conclusion**

I hope this guide was of some help. Let me know if this helps.

We’re expecting to release it to Beta in the next few business days, with a release to Production a week later.

Better AI memory was the top requested feature in our latest player survey, with 78% of you saying you’d be excited about it. The experiences and feedback you shared with us on Discord, Reddit, and support further emphasized how important memory is to improving your experience. Because of all your feedback, along with [doubling context lengths](https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/1chr12s/how_we_gave_players_2x_context_on_ai_dungeon/), we decided to devote the majority of Drop #3 to improving AI memory in AI Dungeon.

The Memory System stores and retrieves key information from your adventure, no matter the context length. It keeps the AI on track and lets you create deeper, richer stories on AI Dungeon. We believe it’s one of the most significant improvements to AI Dungeon in a long time, and we’re excited for you to try it out!

# Why We Built The Memory System

# Why Memory Matters in AI Dungeon

A while back, Nick posted a [Heroes Dev Log](https://blog.latitude.io/heroes-dev-logs/10) about why memory is such an important part of AI adventures. The core promise of AI Dungeon is that you can have ultimate freedom to be who you want to be and that the choices you make truly matter. But if the AI forgets those choices after a few thousand tokens, then those choices actually become meaningless, breaking the power of that promise.

If the AI forgets the names or details of characters you meet, how can you build deep meaningful relationships with them? If you set out on an epic quest, but halfway through, the AI forgets why you even started on it, then how does that quest have any meaning?

>I’ve been realizing that to build AI Dungeon into the game our players truly deserve we have to solve this problem. —Nick Walton

It became clear to us that solving this long-term memory problem would be one of the most powerful ways we could make your AI Dungeon experience deeper, richer, and more meaningful.

At first, we solved this problem only in Heroes, building a new memory system, which we [wrote about here](https://blog.latitude.io/heroes-dev-logs/11). We originally weren’t going to bring that improvement to AID since it’s a very complex system to build, but after hearing from alpha testers just how powerful it was, we knew it had the potential to significantly improve AI Dungeon as well. It took quite a bit of work to get it right (Alpha testers can attest to the number of iterations we went through), but we finally figured out the version that we believe will transform AI Dungeon into a much better experience.

# AI Context Length, a major technical constraint

So why do we need a memory system?

One of the biggest limitations of using AI large language models is limited context length, which is the amount of information the AI can process when generating its next output. Each model has its own max context length limit, and we also have tier limits in AI Dungeon since the longer your context length is, the higher the cost for the AI to generate a response. Context length is a real, unavoidable constraint that we have to work within.

In AI Dungeon, we construct the context we send to the AI by combining text from your story with AI Instructions, Plot Essentials (formerly called “Memory”), Author’s Note, and relevant Story Cards. The AI processes this information and generates the next action in your adventure.

Eventually, the amount of content in your story exceeds the amount of text we can send to the AI. We have to cut portions of text, usually by removing the oldest parts of your story text. Since text is cut, it can feel like the AI is “forgetting” important details of your story since those details were unable to be sent to the AI.

# How players have managed the context problem

If you’re one of our more experienced players, you know that through careful manual editing of Plot Essentials, Story Cards, and Author’s Note, you can make sure important details are still being included in the context.

Or perhaps you decided to subscribe to higher tiers on AI Dungeon, which offer longer context lengths and extend how long stories can be played before text starts getting trimmed. Our free tier gives players up to 2000 tokens of context (about 8,000-10,000 characters of text). Mythic, our highest tier, has models that support 16x more context than the free tier, a whopping 32,000 tokens of context (and GPT-4 Turbo can support 128k with credits). Every doubling of context approximately doubles the cost we have to pay for your AI call. That’s why additional context is a paid feature of our different tiers.

# Why we want to do better

While these solutions can help, we don’t think you should have to pay for the most expensive plan to have a good experience on AI Dungeon. We also don’t think you should have to break immersion to constantly manage the context being sent to the AI.

We’d like you to be able to create immersive stories where you don’t have to worry whether the AI will forget important details you worked so hard to create. We want you to have adventures where you’re not afraid to build deep investment in your character, your relationships with the characters around you, and the lore of the whole world, where you can play a single adventure for months on end in a world that just gets richer and richer with each passing hour.

With the new Memory system, we’re taking an important step toward providing an experience in which the AI can more reliably recall important details of your plot and story, giving you a deeper, richer AI Dungeon experience.

# How the Memory System works

# Memory System Overview

# What information should we store and use?

As we considered what information should be part of the memory system, we found ourselves seeking inspiration from how the human brain works. When our brains store and recall information, we use two strategies. The first is by compressing memories, where we take a large chunk of information and distill it to remember the most important parts. The second is memory retrieval, where some memories stored in our brain only come to mind when they are relevant to our current context.

For instance, once you finish reading this blog post, it’s unlikely that you’ll be able to recall it word for word in its entirety, but you’ll probably be able to recall the high-level concepts, big changes, and parts that matter to you. This is compressed memory.

You also have a retrieval system that will bring important memories to your mind when they’re relevant. If you hear the word “fire hydrant,” your brain retrieves memories about what a fire hydrant is. You might think of its color and shape, its function and purpose, or any specific memories you have involving one.

Both memory compression and memory retrieval are important parts of enabling your brain to remember what’s important and have the right context when it needs it.

These two features of our memory system are extremely useful in AI Dungeon, too. The story equivalent to a compressed memory is summarization, which will compress a section of the story to just the high-level information about the setting, characters, and events. Being able to retrieve more detailed memories is important, too, since that lets the AI remember important details when they’re relevant in the current context.

# What are AI Dungeon Memories?

The purpose of the Memory System is to compress, store, and retrieve Memories to give the AI both a high-level perspective and the ability to recall specific details.

For AI Dungeon, a Memory is an AI-generated summary of a small set of your previous story actions. The summarized Memory retains key plot details but without the illustrative prose that is common in AI Dungeon adventures, making it more information-dense than the text of your adventure.

A new Memory is created by taking four of your previous actions (and the AI’s responses) and sending them to an AI model trained to summarize stories. This summary output from the AI is a Memory.

When starting a new adventure, we’ll wait until you are 8 actions deep into your adventure, and then we’ll summarize the oldest four actions (actions 1-4 of your adventure) into your first Memory. This means your first four actions will be summarized and stored as a Memory, but your most recent four actions are not. Then, after you take four more actions (now you’re up to 12 actions), we’ll summarize the previous 4 as a new memory (actions 5-8). This means your first 8 actions have been converted into two separate memories and your 4 most recent actions have not been. You are free to make edits or undo your last four actions without it impacting Memories.

This cycle repeats indefinitely, and a new memory is created every four actions.

# Two Complimentary Features: Auto Summarization and Memory Bank

Memories are used by the two major features that make up the new Memory System: Auto Summarization and the Memory Bank. These two features work together to recall important information, giving the AI the ability to remember the high-level overview and to remember specific relevant details, just like our brains do.

Auto Summarization keeps a running overview of your story’s plot to help the AI track the overall direction of your story. We do this by appending new Memories to your Story Summary, a new Plot Component we’re adding to support this feature. After several Memories are added to the Story Summary, we’ll re-summarize it by sending it to our summarization AI model. Because the summary will have the overall context of your story, it will help keep the AI on track and make sure it doesn’t lose the plot.

The Memory Bank stores and intelligently retrieves relevant Memories and includes them in the context. In practice, it acts like an automatic Story Card system since it saves important details from the story and then dynamically inserts them into the context when they are relevant to your current action. Whereas the Auto Summarization feature is meant to keep track of the overall plot and story direction, the Memory Bank might recall important details like your dog’s name, where you found the Sword of Demons, or that Rangers are allergic to horses and only ride cows.

# How Auto Summarization Works

# A new Story Summary Plot Component

As we mentioned, there is a new Plot Component called Story Summary where the Auto Summarization feature will store the summary it maintains for your story.

[The new Story Summary plot component, which will store the summaries created by the new Memory System Auto Summarization feature.](https://preview.redd.it/a1tf50yv982d1.png?width=784&format=png&auto=webp&s=a16457b22e3ffa59fa3b43293b119b6e03b968af)

Although Auto Summarization is a paid feature, free players can still use this new plot component to curate a summary of their adventure manually.

Like other Plot Components, the Story Summary can be used by our content creators for published Scenarios. It could be used to include backstory information for your players to use, and it will be utilized by the Auto Summarization feature if enabled by the player.

We’ve added Story Summary to the context inspector so you can track how many tokens of context it’s using for each call.

# Auto-updating the Story Summary with Memories

With Auto Summarization enabled, each time a new Memory has been created, it will be appended to the Story Summary plot component. Once the Story Summary gets long enough, we’ll pass it to our summarization model and compress the summary. This will ensure that the Story Summary continues to be an information-dense overview of the entire story plot.

This process will continue throughout your adventure, with new Memories appended and then re-summarized automatically.

# Auto Summarization for Existing Adventures

The Auto Summarization will work best for new adventures since the summary feature will dynamically update from the beginning of the adventure.

For existing stories, we’ll summarize the last 8000 tokens of your adventure when you take your first action with Auto Summarization enabled. Or, if you prefer, you could manually summarize the story, and the AI will take that into account for all future summarizations.

# Summaries and Editing

Even with Auto Summarization enabled, you can edit the Story Summary manually. You may want to edit the automatically created summary to correct any errors or add additional clarifying details. Although the Auto Summarization overwrites your existing summary, your edits ARE sent to the summarization AI, so they should be incorporated in the new summary.

Only edits to your most recent four actions, including changes, undos, redos, and erases, will be considered by the AI for the Auto Summarization. Any changes to previous actions, including the use of Erase to Here, will not update the summary. We will, however, update any corresponding Memories stored in the Memory Bank by summarizing the action set that creates that memory. If you make changes earlier in your adventure, and those changes would have an impact on the summary, you’ll need to update the Story Summary manually.

This is due to the limitations and costs of the summarization AI model. Like all models, we are constrained by context size for the summarization. Many adventures would extend far beyond the available context limit, so regenerating a summary based on edits wouldn't be possible in many cases. Making new summarization calls for every historical change could also become very expensive.

# How the Memory Bank Works

# Let’s get technical: Embeddings and Vectors

The Memory Bank uses AI technologies that will be new to many of you. To explain how the Memory Bank stores and retrieves relevant memories, you’ll need a basic understanding of embeddings, vectors, and embedding models.

Embeddings represent how similar words and phrases are by mapping them in a multidimensional space. They are created by passing text into specialized embedding language models, which return a vector of numbers as a result.

You can then do simple math to compare how similar different vectors are to each other. For example “water” would be more similar to “liquid” than it would be to “solid”. You can also compare phrases and questions. For example, “Who is Sir Theo?” might match closest with the phrase, “Sir Theo introduces himself to you as the knight who slew the evil dragon of Larion”. These two phrases might also match closely to other passages about Sir Theo or the dragon of Larion. But none of those phrases would likely match very closely to the phrase “Sarah was a forest ranger.”

This lets us build a memory retrieval system. First, we store a bunch of memories in the memory bank with both their text and the embedding vector of that text. Then, when we want to find relevant memories, we decide what text we want to use to look up memories (for our system, we use the most recent action). We get the embedding vector for that lookup query, and we compare it against all the vectors in our memory bank and get a relevance score.

A higher score means it’s more similar to the query, and a lower score means it’s less similar. This lets us decide which memories are relevant to the current events in your story and should be included in the context sent to the AI when generating the story.

Now, we’re ready to talk about AI Dungeon’s new Memory Bank Feature.

# Storing and Retrieving AI Dungeon Memories using Embedding Models

With the Memory Bank, each Memory (an AI-generated summary of four past actions) is embedded and stored. As you continue to take more actions, your Memory Bank starts to fill with more Memories.

When you start a new story, your Memory Bank will be empty. As you take actions, and Memories are created, they will begin to fill your available memory slots. Initially, no memories will be used since your entire adventure history will fit in the context. Once your story has reached the point where it can no longer fit your whole adventure into the context window, we start to retrieve memories from the Memory Bank. We do this by using an embedding model to rank all of your memories by relevance to your current story.

[The Memory bank starting to fill up and be utilized as the Adventure is no longer fitting within the context window](https://preview.redd.it/2319av8ka82d1.png?width=816&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7ff303c3267286eb1015cd7bc88c26f35fdc089)

Then, we take the most relevant memories and include them in the context being sent to the AI for the next action of the story. For example, if you are just returning to the town of Castlebrook, the AI will find all the memories related to Castlebrook, remember what happened the last time you were here, and include the most relevant in the context. These are called “Used Memories.”

[Memories viewer showing the timeline of memories and which will be included in the context.](https://preview.redd.it/hrl1s280a82d1.png?width=934&format=png&auto=webp&s=89612152b17ef0c1b5e0183a37b93b55b00cfc7f)

Before including a Memory in the context, we also check to see whether the Memory is included in its full text within the Story Summary. This check prevents the text of a Memory from appearing twice in the context.

The Memory Bank will be allocated a portion of the context window, similar to how we allocate space to Plot Essentials (formerly called Memory), Author’s Note, and Story Cards. Based on the context space available, we’ll include as many of the top memories as will fit from your memory bank.

Once your Memory Bank has been filled and a new Memory has been created, we remove the least used memories to make room for the new addition. These removed memories are called “Forgotten Memories”. Just like with human memory, very old memories might stay in the Memory Bank forever if they have been used frequently.

[Context inspector showing the state where your memory bank is full, memories are being utilized, but some memories are being forgotten to make room for new memories. ](https://preview.redd.it/01tk8fk3a82d1.png?width=810&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a67697579c0a81d383ed79bc13179b65349e8e8)

The larger your Memory Bank, the more room you have to store memories that could be used in your story, increasing the accuracy of the AI storyteller.

As you play, the AI will continually curate the most important and relevant memories from your story and intelligently include them in the context being sent to the AI when they are relevant, improving the overall experience.

# Launch Details

# Opt-in Experimental Feature

The Memory System could be one of the most foundational changes to AI Dungeon in recent history. Although we’ve tested it thoroughly internally and with our Alpha testers, we anticipate that as you all start playing with it and give us feedback, we may need to adjust parts of the experience. There could also be unintended behaviors we haven’t encountered yet, or edge cases we didn’t consider. The design might need adjustments to be clearer or more helpful to you.

To avoid any unintended player frustration, we’re launching this first into Beta and then into Production as an opt-in Experimental feature. You can enable it under the AI Models tab on the game screen settings sidebar. There’s a new section there called “Memory System.”

[New Memory System settings, found in the Gameplay section of the game settings sidebar.](https://preview.redd.it/mkr0nih8a82d1.png?width=846&format=png&auto=webp&s=484b687c6c6e7a5f5111b37e67b756d40fa5fc56)

# How your membership tier affects the memory system

The Memory System will be a Premium feature. When we initially announced it, we expected to make it available to Free players. Our initial prototype was based entirely on the embedding system, and our projected costs were much lower. As we continued to iterate and improve the system, we realized summarization played an important role for both Auto Summarization and the Memory Bank. Those summary AI calls increased the cost of running the Memory System for players and, as a result, it’s currently cost-prohibitive to offer the Memory System to Free players.

Our hope is that we can offer the Memory System to free players in the future. We’ve done this before with other features that were Premium only, then made available to free players over time. Examples include unlimited AI calls, image generation, multiple AI model options, advanced settings, and even Premium AI (with our promo actions).

All subscribers will have access to the Auto Summarization feature. For the Memory Bank, each tier will have a set number of memories that can be stored. You can view the Memory Bank sizes of each tier on our [Membership Page](https://play.aidungeon.com/members).

# Key differences from the Heroes memory system

Those familiar with the Heroes memory system will see similarities with this new Memory System for AI Dungeon. The work done on Heroes directly inspired and informed the new memory system. There are some important differences and adaptations we made to implement it for AI Dungeon.

The Heroes experience is a much more traditional RPG experience. We track important stats like health, quests, inventory, levels, and player characteristics, which are stored in a “game state.” We didn't bring this part over since AI Dungeon is a collaborative storytelling experience.

We also made some adjustments to account for the different gameplay in AI Dungeon. We know you all value editing, a concept that isn’t as prevalent in Heroes, and supporting editing with the AI Dungeon Memory System required some adaptations.

# We’re excited for you to try Long Term Memory!

You’ve repeatedly told us that the AI forgetting important information is one of the most frustrating parts of playing AI Dungeon. The new Memory System is built to address that issue. As you play with it, please share feedback and let us know how it affects your stories and adventures. This is a new system, and that means there’s opportunity for improvement and iteration.

We know many of you have been excited about this new feature. Thanks for being patient as we went through additional iteration cycles to get the experience right. We hope the Memory System will help you have better, deeper, and longer adventures.","True","False","True","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","45968","public","None","https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Iy_DYTYOQcm67ZY5ICAyFYT2B0I4yK7u9OviCWmvud0.jpg","80","140","How the

* Redirecting to the home page after signing in or creating an account should now be much more reliable
* After editing elements of your Adventure during gameplay (eg. Plot Components in the sidebar settings), the loading icon may now show up in place of the game screen buttons while your changes are saving.
* Fixed an issue on iOS where external links in the game screen would crash the app (eg. the Plot Components Guidebook link under the settings sidebar)
* Fixed an issue where importing Story Cards needed an app or browser refresh
* Fixed an issue where you couldn’t type decimal values for the Model Settings sliders
* Renamed “Advanced Settings” to “Model Settings” under the settings sidebar
* Renamed the “Memory” Plot Component to “Plot Essentials” to accommodate the new Memory System

# Memory System

**This is an Experimental feature in Beta that we will continue working on over the next several weeks.**

* Enabled the new, two-part Memory System: Auto Summarization and the Memory Bank (premium only)
* Added a new “Memory System” section to the settings sidebar
* Relocated the Context Length setting to the Memory System section
* Added a “Memory Bank” toggle option under the Memory System section
* Added an “Auto Summarization” toggle option under the Memory System section
* **The Memory Bank and Auto Summarization settings are turned OFF by default in Adventures. Before testing, make sure to turn them ON under the Memory System section.**
* If you enable the Memory Bank and Auto Summarization settings in one Adventure, they will be enabled for all Adventures and every model
* When Auto Summarization is toggled on, an AI Story Summary will now be generated
* Added a new Plot Component called “Story Summary” (all players)
* Added an “Experimental” label to the Memory Bank, Auto Summarization, and Story Summary under the sidebar settings
* Added a new “Story Summary” section to the Context Viewer
* Added “Memories” and the Memory Bank to the Adventure section of the Context Viewer
* Memory Bank details will now be shown in the Context Viewer for premium players, even if the whole Adventure fits in the context and the setting is toggled off
* “Explore Memories” now says “Enable Memories” in the Context Viewer when the Memory Bank is toggled off
* Memory System stats will be hidden for free players in the Context Viewer
* Changed some colors in the Context Viewer bar graph and key to make it easier to distinguish different sections
* Separated Memories from the Adventure text in the Context Viewer bar graph
* Separated viewing Adventure text (”Action Tokens”) from “Explore Memories” in the Context Viewer details
* Updated the Context Viewer key to say “Memories” instead of memory
* Updated the “Learn More” URL under the question mark menu of the “Memories Stored” section of the Context Viewer
* Renamed “Long Term Memory” to “Memory Bank” under the Memory Settings
* The Memory Bank shouldn’t start storing Memories until the first Story Summary is created
* Memory summaries shouldn’t be duplicated between the Story Summary and the Memory Bank
* Story Summary shouldn’t be included in the context until 100% of your Adventure can no longer fit and summaries exist
* To use context more effectively, if there is extra space after adding Memories, we will now add Story Cards that weren't able to initially fit
* Improved the context allocation algorithm to not allocate space for Memories if we don't have enough Memories to fill it
* Further adjusted backend context proportions to find a more effective balance between all of the elements
* Fixed several big issues with retries, undos, and redos that caused the Memory System to work much less effectively
* Fixed a bunch of various small UI/design issues
* Fixed an issue where the very first story section was duplicated in Memories
* Fixed an issue that might have affected the most recent relevant memories from appearing in the “Explore Memories” section of the Context Viewer
* Fixed an issue where the Context Viewer wouldn't add Story Summary to the total used tokens
* Fixed issues where editing/retrying/undoing could mess up Memories
* Fixed an issue where the relevant memory order was wrong in the context viewer
* Fixed an issue that would result in the wrong number being displayed for Memories Stored
* Fixed an issue where if you edited the most recent action the old version would still be used when generating the next action
* Fixed an issue where starting on an existing Adventure could cause the Memory Bank to fill with the wrong Memories
* Fixed an issue where Memories weren’t showing up in some cases
* Fixed an issue where Context Viewer totals would exceed the available context length
* Fixed an issue where Auto Summarization would still run even if it was toggled off
* Fixed an issue where Auto Summarization wouldn't run if Memory Bank was toggled off and there wasn’t a summary
* Fixed an issue where “Summary:” would show up in the Story Summary. This change should help prevent repetitive summary generation.
* Fixed an issue where selecting an AI comparison could cause information to not be included in the Memory System
* Fixed an issue where you could edit the Story Summary or AI Instructions while an action was loading which could result in changes being lost when the action was completed. **These components are now locked while actions are loading in the game screen.**
* Fixed an issue where there wasn't a clear visual indicator when the Story Summary and AI Instructions were locked while an action was loading.
* Cleaned up descriptions for the Memory System in the settings sidebar and Context Viewer
* Added a quick link to the pricing page for free players in the Memory System section of the Context Viewer
* Dramatically improved the way we handle auto-save

**Known Issues**

* The Memory System may not work well in Multiplayer games yet
* Auto-creating a summary for an existing Adventure is not yet working correctly
* If Story Summary has been added to a Scenario, it won’t be included in the resulting Adventure’s context until the entire Adventure can no longer fit in the context. We may be adjusting this in the future.

https://youtu.be/-vV99nDLcA4

I guess we didn't play enough to really stress the memory system, but I really like the auto summary. I like having a synopsis showing our achievements and progress so I can review it at the end of a session. So far it's worked well.

In this case, it got the details slightly wrong by the end. It got who was responsible for the treachery wrong, but those are easy edits someone can make. I know it's meant to help the model to remember guiding details, but it's really fun to just read about our misdeeds like it's a newspaper article.

We switched to Llama 3 from Mixtral part of the way through because I wasn't getting ouput that I expected. Maybe it was my inexperience that some of the tricks I've learned didn't work. It was fine, but I still noticed some telltale phrases that Llama 3 tends to favor like the bit about the ""air rippling as if the fabric of reality is being torn apart""

Anyway, thanks for the update! It's so cool to continue to see new features like this as a relatively new user.

BROWSER BUGS (chrome mobile)
- in browser, many times the Story summary component auto deletes itself when you hit continue or retry. 
- in browser, many times the Story summary auto deletes itself when you hit continue or retry leaving the component blank. 
- in browser, when you edit AI instructions the cursor will change position on its own.
- in browser, when you edit AI instruction, often the word you just wrote will vanish. You have to click somewhere else and then back to where you were writing to make it reappear.

STORY SUMMARY NOT SAVED
- when you close a scenario and open it again the AI will generate a new summary and not save the one generated in the last gameplay.

SECOND/THIRD PERSON INCONSISTENCY
- in app, when the summary is generated automatically it is written in second person but if you close the scenario and open it again the story summary is blank and a new one is generated in third person. 

REPETITION OF OLD ACTIONS
- sometimes, with both Mixtral and Tiefighter, the AI will give as response an old action disconnected to the actual events even with a temperature of 0.8. It seems like it continues from the summary and not from the story. 

SUGGESTION FOR NEW FEATURE
- story card auto generation: if the AI detects a new name or a recurring object/place it asks you automatically if you want to create a story card for it if not present. If you accept it will create a story card filled with the infos provided until that moment in the story.

It should take 1 credit for every 2000 tokens after 2000 free tokens, but it takes 1 credit for every move after 2000 tokens. So instead of paying 6 credits for 14k context, you pay 1 credit per action.

# New Models

* Introduced Llama 3 70B as a new, experimental AI text model. This is available for Champion, Legend, and Mythic players.
* Introduced GPT-4o as a new, experimental AI text model. This is available for Legend and Mythic players.
* Introduced WizardLM 8x22B as a new, experimental AI text model. This is available for Legend and Mythic players.
* Updated WizardLM 8x22B context to cost 1 credit per 2000 tokens used beyond Legend and Mythic tier limits
* Fixed an issue where AI text generation credit costs wouldn’t show the correct number of credits charged
* AI text generation credit costs will now always be shown for models that cost credits beyond a certain context length, even if 0 credits will be charged

# AI Instructions

* Introduced a new feature, AI Instructions. This can be found under the “+ Add Plot Component” button under the in-game settings sidebar and during Scenario creation.
* Deprecated the Banned Word feature. AI Instructions should be more effective at helping you guide the AI away from words and topics you wish to avoid.
* Fixed an issue in the mobile apps where “Insert Example” would fail to insert an example of AI Instructions
* Fixed an issue where AI Instructions were not getting saved properly outside of the game screen
* Fixed an issue where you couldn’t change AI Instructions to model default outside of the game screen
* Fixed an issue with AI Instructions where you couldn’t choose between Model Default, Scenario Default, and Custom
* Fixed an issue where the cursor could be jumpy in the AI Instructions text field
* Added a 100,000 character limit to AI Instructions for technical stability and player flexibility

# Memory System

**This is an Experimental feature that will we continue working on over the next several weeks.**

* Enabled the new, two-part Memory System: Auto Summarization and the Memory Bank (premium only)
* Added a new “Memory System” section to the settings sidebar
* Relocated the Context Length setting to the Memory System section
* Added a “Memory Bank” toggle option under the Memory System section
* Added an “Auto Summarization” toggle option under the Memory System section
* **The Memory Bank and Auto Summarization settings are turned OFF by default in Adventures. Before testing, make sure to turn them ON under the Memory System section.**
* If you enable the Memory Bank and Auto Summarization settings in one Adventure, they will be enabled for all Adventures and every model
* When Auto Summarization is toggled on, an AI Story Summary will now be generated
* Added a new Plot Component called “Story Summary” (all players)
* Added an “Experimental” label to the Memory Bank, Auto Summarization, and Story Summary under the sidebar settings
* Added a new “Story Summary” section to the Context Viewer
* Added “Memories” and the Memory Bank to the Adventure section of the Context Viewer
* Memory Bank details will now be shown in the Context Viewer for premium players, even if the whole Adventure fits in the context and the setting is toggled off
* “Explore Memories” now says “Enable Memories” in the Context Viewer when the Memory Bank is toggled off
* Memory System stats will be hidden for free players in the Context Viewer
* Changed some colors in the Context Viewer bar graph and key to make it easier to distinguish different sections
* Separated Memories from the Adventure text in the Context Viewer bar graph
* Separated viewing Adventure text (”Action Tokens”) from “Explore Memories” in the Context Viewer details
* Updated the Context Viewer key to say “Memories” instead of memory
* Updated the “Learn More” URL under the question mark menu of the “Memories Stored” section of the Context Viewer
* Renamed “Long Term Memory” to “Memory Bank” under the Memory Settings
* The Memory Bank shouldn’t start storing Memories until the first Story Summary is created
* Memory summaries shouldn’t be duplicated between the Story Summary and the Memory Bank
* Story Summary shouldn’t be included in the context until 100% of your Adventure can no longer fit and summaries exist
* To use context more effectively, if there is extra space after adding Memories, we will now add Story Cards that weren't able to initially fit
* Improved the context allocation algorithm to not allocate space for Memories if we don't have enough Memories to fill it
* Further adjusted backend context proportions to find a more effective balance between all of the elements
* Fixed several big issues with retries, undos, and redos that caused the Memory System to work much less effectively
* Fixed a bunch of various small UI/design issues
* Fixed an issue where the very first story section was duplicated in Memories
* Fixed an issue that might have affected the most recent relevant memories from appearing in the “Explore Memories” section of the Context Viewer
* Fixed an issue where the Context Viewer wouldn't add Story Summary to the total used tokens
* Fixed issues where editing/retrying/undoing could mess up Memories
* Fixed an issue where the relevant memory order was wrong in the context viewer
* Fixed an issue that would result in the wrong number being displayed for Memories Stored
* Fixed an issue where if you edited the most recent action the old version would still be used when generating the next action
* Fixed an issue where starting on an existing Adventure could cause the Memory Bank to fill with the wrong Memories
* Fixed an issue where Memories weren’t showing up in some cases
* Fixed an issue where Context Viewer totals would exceed the available context length
* Fixed an issue where Auto Summarization would still run even if it was toggled off
* Fixed an issue where Auto Summarization wouldn't run if Memory Bank was toggled off and there wasn’t a summary
* Fixed an issue where “Summary:” would show up in the Story Summary. This change should help prevent repetitive summary generation.
* Fixed an issue where selecting an AI comparison could cause information to not be included in the Memory System
* Fixed an issue where you could edit the Story Summary or AI Instructions while an action was loading which could result in changes being lost when the action was completed. **These components are now locked while actions are loading in the game screen.**
* Fixed an issue where there wasn't a clear visual indicator when the Story Summary and AI Instructions were locked while an action was loading.
* Cleaned up descriptions for the Memory System in the settings sidebar and Context Viewer
* Added a quick link to the pricing page for free players in the Memory System section of the Context Viewer
* Dramatically improved the way we handle auto-save
* Removed language from the settings sidebar about data being used to improve the Memory System
* Fixed an issue where the Memory System wasn’t working for non-host players in Multiplayer games. We are in the process of capturing other bugs to fix with the Memory System and Multiplayer.

I use this command to make the AI describe in detail an action or a character. Sometimes the AI just ignores the command.

- [Plot: ...] (variations: ### Plot:... / ## Plot: ... , This second one never really worked)

The AI should use what you wrote after ""plot:"" for the creation of next actions.
After the update 90% of the time the AI will not follow the plot you wrote in the command to create the new actions but it will continue AFTER the events you described in the command.
It also often happens when you use this command that the AI will begin the new action using the last phrase of the last action as first phrase of the new action, a straight copy/paste.

Now I'm getting kinda bored with the usual stories. Anyone else feel the same?

I was thinking it would be cool to have more game-like scenarios with clear goals. Like, imagine a prison scenario in which you have to convince the bot (prison guard) to let you go or teaming up with the bot to solve a mystery and you'd get points based on your progress or something like that.

Anyone else into this kind of stuff? Did you stumble upon stories like that on AI Dungeon or elsewhere?

Does anyone have ideas on how to deal with WizardLM overdescribing stuff? As the RP goes on, it completely forgets to include dialogue, instead only focusing on description. Sometimes I have to reload the message 10 times to get a simple sentence included. And yes, I mostly use story mode, I tried switching to “do”, as well as altering ai instructions, or authors notes,  but the issue still persists.

But people don't come here when the problems are resolved, right? Which, I also get. People expect things to work all the time. And if things are working, why come here?

  
The reality is that sometimes things unexpectedly don't work as intended. Software development is complicated - there's a good reason why people in that field make so much. It's a difficult job and requires a lot of work and internal architecture understanding. What you may not know - the \\*big secret\\* in the software development field - is that there are two kinds of software developers: those who genuinely work hard to ensure their product's success, and those who do just enough to get by to make a paycheck.

  
The fact that AIDungeon's server failures are so brief is evidence enough for me - a fellow software dev - that the developers at Latitude are genuinely passionate and hardworking such that they do indeed care for their product.

  
I just wanted to make this post in acknowledgement of the hardworking developers at Latitude. Thank you for all of your hard work! \\[Redacted\\] happens, I'm all too familiar with that.

As noted in our past blog post ([https://latitude.io/blog/how-we-evaluate-new-ai-models-for-ai-dungeon](https://latitude.io/blog/how-we-evaluate-new-ai-models-for-ai-dungeon)), because of their low usage and lower quality, we're choosing to focus on maintaining newer models and features.

These models carried us for a long time and will always be remembered for the good (and crazy) times. If you're missing them today or would like to remember past adventures with them, we generated a song in their honor:

I've had the game installed for a while and I've been playing it pretty religiously for the past week or so, I mean I'd spend whole nights playing, I've gotten a couple of scenarios above 200+ responses and they've been all custom made (I rarely if at all play player-made scenarios).

I've never had an issue before with AI Dungeons and certainly haven't until yesterday... For some odd reason, and it really is weird to explain, but, it seems like every time I have AI Dungeons open or I'm playing it, my wifi is literally obliterated or is just simply non-existent... Like right now, as I'm writing this post I have AI Dungeons open and I can see my wifi connection come in n out.

This doesn't happen, like I said, when I'm playing anything else or even when I don't have it open. I'm not sure if this is an AI Dungeon problem, but from what I've tried it all seems to lead back to either having it open on Steam or through a tab and I find it really, really, REALLY annoying especially because I want to continue so many of my games but cannot: I can get one or two responses in but after that every time I type and send something to the AI, my wifi connection always cuts out.

I know it's not something to do with my wifi as I can play much larger games without any issues, my computer is connected through an ethernet connection, if anyone knows anything about this issue or if there's no connection between AI Dungeons and alternating wifi connection please let me know. I have chucked it up to being because of the recent updates and changes to the app because I know some people have had seperate issues, however, this feels WAY too specific and I'm worried it's just gonna stay like this forever...

If anyone knows anything please let me know, or even if its a common problem or of course if there's any fixes to it.","True","False","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","46053","public","None","self","None","None","Issue with AI Dungeons","None","0","[]","2","1","https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/1d579zf/issue_with_ai_dungeons/","[]","None","False","None","None","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
