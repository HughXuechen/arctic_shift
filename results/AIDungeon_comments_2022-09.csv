talk in absolutes, ""because he is the king, he is politically powerful."" try not to exceed 500 characters unless you only have a few WI and small memory. Make sure you are not triggering multiples at once. Physical description details beyond something as simple as a fairy tale princess being a ""beautiful blonde princess"" are 99/100 times not going to come up, focus on one appearance detail or two but any more and nah. 

the biggest tip, if you're describing an occupation, describe it in expectations. for example in my x-files commission I described an FBI agent by saying something like ""an FBI agent is expected to dress and act professionally. An FBI agent is held to a high standard of professionalism."" I was then able to simply describe Agent Mulder as a rebellious, independent thinker, and his character was almost spot on from that alone.

but that's working with real world stuff. if you just tell a blank AI that the FBI is here to investigate it's going to already know what to do. if you're doing something that's atypical or won't have a ton of real-world analogues, give a brief description in world info, but when you're actually playing, re-enforce the details yourself as you can't expect an AI to correctly handle a throwing a riding saddle on a six legged, winged, legendary dragon pokemon on its own no matter how well you describe it in WI.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-09-01-021305","1661991185","None","False","0","imlf8e8","False","t3_x28qib","False","t1_imlf8e8","True","t1_imj6oov","/r/AIDungeon/comments/x28qib/any_tips_on_creating_nfsw_entities/imlf8e8/","1662568549","1","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None"

No. The current models are pretty much *still* unanimously considered to be worse than GPT-3 Dragon.

April 26th of 2021, Latitude, the company behind AI Dungeon, implemented a filter for private adventures. They [officially announced the filter](https://latitude.io/blog/update-to-our-community-ai-test-april-2021) the next day. Latitude claimed the filter was *only* supposed to filter pedophilic content (although there was a pretty obvious attempt to filter bestiality as well, as the filter had issues with animals). At the time the filter was added, it was just laughably bad. Mentioning a child, or an animal, or a number below 18, or a sexual term, regardless of the context, triggered the filter when it was first added. The devs also said they'd be monitoring private stories that triggered the filter, which was seen as a privacy violation given how faulty the filter was. There was also nothing preventing the AI from giving outputs that the filter would disallow.

Latitude made some changes to the filter early on. The first major changes were the removal of the censorship of animals, and the change to a two-column filter, where you'd have to use one of the censored words relating to minors, *and* one of the censored words relating to sex, within the last 400 or so characters of the story to trigger the filter. The term ""pedoph"" (and any words containing the term) was an outlier, as it would trigger the filter on it's own, without any other censored words having to be present.

The filter still wasn't good after that, though, since it was, of course, incapable of understanding context. The way they went about filtering also meant that it was incredibly easy for people actually using the AI for pedophilic content to avoid the filter if they knew how. It also meant that words containing censored terms could trigger the filter. As some examples: ""Infantry"" (contained ""infant""), ""breastplate"" (contained ""breast""), ""analysis"" (contained ""anal""), ""cocky"" and ""cockpit"" (both contained ""cock""), ""boyfriend"" and ""girlfriend"" (contained ""boy"" and ""girl"", respectively), etc. Latitude, within a couple of weeks of the filter's existence, also added an automated suspension system that would sometimes automatically suspend players for triggering the filter for up to a week.

It was also [found that AI Dungeon's finetuning data contained some pedophilic content](https://gitgud.io/AuroraPurgatio/aurorapurgatio), which made the AI more likely to output pedophilic content, itself, and which a lot of users saw as being hypocritical.

Additionally, there was a [data breach](https://github.com/AetherDevSecOps/aid_adventure_vulnerability_report) that occured about 2 weeks prior to the filter controversy, and that the AI Dungeon community only found out about during the controversy. It apparently allowed for all private content, except for private content from the first 11 days of AI Dungeon 2's existence, to be accessed. Latitude failed to disclose the breach for months, which people were understandably upset about. It wasn't until 5 months after the breach occurred that [Latitude finally disclosed the breach](https://latitude.io/blog/data-incident-april-2021).

There was also the issue of the moderation of private stories being outsourced to strangers on the internet via a website called ""Taskup"". As a result of this outsourcing, over 100 private stories ended up being leaked on 4chan. To be fair, it [later came to light that the outsourcing was the doing of OpenAI (the company that used to provide Latitude with their AI models), rather than Latitude's doing](https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/pze72g/updated_related_to_taskup_questions/), but that was unknown for months, and regardless of who was responsible for the outsourcing, people were still upset about such a breach of privacy.

Aside from that, during the controversy, several features of AI Dungeon were either made worse, or removed entirely. The ""Explore"" feature, which allowed users to share prompts and stories, and to communicate with one another, was also removed just 2 weeks before the controversy started. That definitely wasn't the cause of the controversy, but it added fuel to the fire regardless. It also didn't help that Latitude went radio silent for most of the controversy.

Eventually, Latitude ditched OpenAI. This was because of a combination of reasons. Firstly, OpenAI began enforcing heavy censorship for their models that disallowed violent content and general sexual content, among other things. Secondly, as a result of some users no longer using the OpenAI AI models as a result of said censorship, Latitude ended up losing the volume-based discount that they previously had for OpenAI's models, meaning that the AI was now significantly more expensive for Latitude to use than before. Thirdly, OpenAI is generally a shitty company and was, as I said before, responsible for over 100 private stories being leaked on 4chan. So, now AI Dungeon uses AI models from AI21. Unfortunately, though, the current AI models are pretty much unanimously considered to be worse than the old ones from OpenAI.

(This paragraph was edited in for the sake of clarity.) For clarification, the filter still exists, but is nowhere near as bad as it was during the controversy. At this point in time, there is no longer a suspension system, and with [Latitude's shift to the ""Walls Approach""](https://latitude.io/blog/the-walls-approach), the filter now only applies to the AI. Latitude also claimed they'd no longer be manually reviewing stuff that triggers the filter. The ""Explore"" page is also back, now called ""Search"". Although it's... kinda worse than before since the Posts section and the ""Top"" sorting option were both removed, for some reason.

There was some controversy a couple of months ago regarding the addition of ads. Prior to ads being implemented, AI Dungeon had been using an energy system for over a year, and the energy had a high enough limit and recharge rate that most users were unhindered by it. When ads were first implemented, you'd get a pop-up ad every 10 or so actions. However, a lot of users ended up disliking this system, as they found the ads to be too intrusive, long, and/or frequent.

Latitude justified the implementation of ads by saying that ads were a highly requested feature. That claim *was* true, but the people who requested for ads to be implemented mainly either wanted ads to restore energy, wanted the option to watch ads for some sort of benefit, or wanted banner ads; people didn't ask for the type of ads that Latitude initially implemented. Anyways, Latitude ended up switching to the current system in which you can watch ads to get 10 actions per ad, and can stockpile actions before playing instead of having to be constantly interrupted by ads while playing. Even with the new ad system, though, there's still a fairly large portion of the community that's unhappy with the ads.

More recently, a couple of weeks ago, there was also [another data breach](https://help.aidungeon.io/faq/s3-buckets-15aug22).

As an addition to what AirPhforce has written.  
You can use multiple WIs at the same time, with the same keyword. This can help the AI, but it can also confuse it or merge the results, because the AI is stupid, especially Griffin.  
When I used Dragon, I usually wrote WI in simple prose. For me it works better than other methods. I also use it for Griffin, but Griffin works meh with WI.  
The result of how strong your WI entry is +-random. For Griffin, it might even be better to put it in \\[\\] so that the AI doesn't think it's a strict text part of the story, but rather additional information like AN. As I metioned, the brackets seem to work as they should, but I haven't tested them properly.  
The best way to test how strong your WI is to test the result directly in the story. Sometimes I use ( \\[Describe blah-blah:\\] or Maria is ) or similar text constructions to generate information or test something.  
As for length, you should stick to 100-250 characters, 500 at most(or mix the sizes). Since this affects the maximum number of WIs you can run at one time and the overall memory. I tried to test the total character limit (MEM+WI) not too long ago, but the results were strange.  
You can expect something like 15-18(100ch.), 10-15(250ch.), 5-10(500ch.), 2-5(1000ch.) entries at a time with an average MEM, AN and a 6k+ch. story.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-09-01-182410","1662049450","None","False","0","imoej42","False","t3_x28qib","False","t1_imoej42","False","t1_imllm52","/r/AIDungeon/comments/x28qib/any_tips_on_creating_nfsw_entities/imoej42/","1665127917","1","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None"

&gt; April 26th of 2021, Latitude, the company behind AI Dungeon, implemented a filter for private adventures. They officially announced the filter the next day. Latitude claimed the filter was only supposed to filter pedophilic content (although there was a pretty obvious attempt to filter bestiality as well, as the filter had issues with animals). At the time the filter was added, it was just laughably bad. Mentioning a child, or an animal, or a number below 18, or a sexual term, regardless of the context, triggered the filter when it was first added

Open AI, Elon Musks company, was the AI provider for the old Dragon model. OAI is the one that mandated the filter, which also included mentions of politics or religion. As a response, AIDG changed AI providers to escape the mandatory no NSFW/Politics/Religion world of OAI. This process took a while so we were stuck with a filter that would trigger and block you for comments such as ""My fucking laptop is only 5 years old!"" 

It was annoying but I personally feel this is overblown in the community; it wasn't AIDG's idea, they broke ties with Elon Musk's company who was the one doing it, and that took some time.

&gt; It was also found that AI Dungeon's finetuning data contained some pedophilic content, which made the AI more likely to output pedophilic content, itself, and which a lot of users saw as being hypocritical.

This was absolutely disgusting and one of the big issues in the early AIDG days as content like Count Gray were from these awful stories, which is why the AI would always insert them as absolute villains given the content the names were adjacent to. This content has been removed from the model as per Nick who confirmed it in the discord. Why it was ever included is an unanswered question as ""we didn't read all the training data"" to me isn't a good enough excuse.

Lastly, they do some good!

For a long time, creators of content could set world info (WI) text to private, so they would be on and working, but as a player they were invisible, unknown and hidden away. The idea was to hide spoilers and stuff so folks could share a mystery but not reveal the killer publicly or something. Instead a bunch of users used this secret world info to just make characters randomly blurt slurs by secretly hiding overt racism/sexism/etc into it. This came to light as soon as all world info entries were made public for all and this awful stuff could just be seen by anyone. 

Making WI's public also allowed the community to shame users who had uploaded ""fake"" scenarios wherein they claimed to have 500+ world entries for their fantasy world, only to see they only had written 2 or 3, perhaps 600 characters of text total, and the scenario was a total lie. A specific example I saw was a dark-ages royalty scenario, where in the princess and queen were both described secretly as ""absolute bimbos with huge Brazilian string breast implants"" in the world info. Pre WI being public, you'd just have to wonder why the princess was always being described with gigantic bolt-on tits despite it allegedly being the year 700AD.

If you fill in the background field as follows (""Fluffy is a cute anthropomorphic demoness. She likes to prank people and is very good at finding things. She has long yellow hair, big green eyes, and is four feet tall.""), then the AI will more likely just try to rephrase that text a bit.

The generation feature is more useful for quick generating tons of WIs with a blank or nearly blank background field, like (A cute anthropomorphic demoness).

That's why I usually generate the WI entry in the main story and then just copy it into WI. This gives you more control over length, creativity, etc. and also involves part of your story. Or I just copy the part of the story that introduces new stuff into WI.

A question. Would it be possible to incorporate some sort of attack and defense skills defined in the script, then have the ability to create like a weapon or a suit of armor that will augment these skills or stats, or just be able to set like defense = 4 for some Giant Rat type mob. Some way to use equipment to set things up so damage and defense can be made more easily variable between characters without having to use super inflated skill numbers? Your basic damage calculation seems reasonable, but when the master assassin and the Half-Starved Giant Rat are both rolling a d20 for damage on all attacks it can make things difficult from an rp perspective, especially starting with low skill values and using TES style levling. Early Morrowind combat sucked lol.

Maybe you can already do this, but maybe being able to specify an n-sided die to roll for each skill you define or something would be helpful? That way the rat will use a d6 for his attacks, and you can use a d12 or whatever you like.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-09-03-160126","1662213686","None","1662217138.0","0","imxe0gg","False","t3_x3cam0","False","t1_imxe0gg","True","t1_imwn6vy","/r/AIDungeon/comments/x3cam0/dnd_in_ai_dungeon_big_updates_are_out/imxe0gg/","1665117007","1","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None",""

Go to the NovelAI thread, or better yet, any thread that specializes in Stable Diffusion. And look at different examples of pictures and related strings. Then just test them in AID. Note that the results may be different due to the AID's additional data and settings. Also, the img generation is quite random ... Even changing a single word in a string can completely change the result, or just influence the style.

So basically, you should have good text explaining the picture you want to create. Then you add extra text, i.e. style etc. All this information is used to form the string to generate the image. Also, maybe, you should play with CFG Scale, Sampler (or other settings if you don't care about credits).

Then try to generate a bunch of pictures using AID while editing your string...

Example text for testing, ""a beautiful elf princess, ethereal face. Painted by **{artist name}**""""a beautiful elf princess, ethereal face. Painted by **Ida Rentoul Outhwaite**""[https://www.reddit.com/user/Abstract\\_Albatross/comments/x30ir5/artist\\_studies\\_a\\_beautiful\\_elf\\_princess\\_ethereal/](https://www.reddit.com/user/Abstract_Albatross/comments/x30ir5/artist_studies_a_beautiful_elf_princess_ethereal/)

""**a beautiful elf princess, ethereal face.**"" here is main image text, while ""**Painted by {artist name}**"" is kinda AID's ""Image Style"".You may write like this ""a beautiful elf princess, ethereal face."" or ""a beautiful elf princess, ethereal face. **Ida Rentoul Outhwaite**"" etc., and also achieve the different result.

P.s. Latitude has released an interesting feature and I understand how it should work in AID. But... now it works, in the typical AID way... And it is somewhat inconveniently implemented.

In addition to this, over the past year and a half, the entire active community of enthusiasts engaged in testing, writing guides and the like - practically scattered or moved to the competition. I had hoped that Steam will revive the situation a bit, but there the situation is even worse than on Reddit. =)","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-09-04-231830","1662326310","None","1662328567.0","0","in3rxkt","False","t3_x5qk97","False","t1_in3rxkt","True","t3_x5qk97","/r/AIDungeon/comments/x5qk97/any_way_to_get_the_ai_to_draw_in_a_different/in3rxkt/","1665109184","1","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None",""

This can be done in several ways:

1. Two WI entries with separate keywords. But, you add brief information about nation B to the WI entry of city A, and you do the same with the entry about nation B, i.e., you add brief information about city A. So only one medium WI triggered in a time.
2. One big WI(but not too big) with amount of keywords. Which describes nation B and city A in the same WI entry.
3. Two completely separate WI entries(or kinda). But, you add the same keywords(or some combinations) to the different WIs so that the WIs are triggered at the same time(or simultaneously, but from time to time).

You should avoid triggering too many entries (separate or not) at the same time, not only because it may confuse the AI, but also because of memory limitations. Some entries may simply push others out of memory, in addition, the more WIs activated, the less of the main story is used to generate the next output.

"[]","False","None","PikeldeoAcedia","1618486137","None","None","[]","None","None","None","text","t2_bjxon9zg","False","False","Yeah, I'll insert my list of notable alternatives here. There are *far* more alternatives than just the ones I'm about to mention, but most of them are either just much too different from AID to be suitable alternatives, or are outright worse than AID and/or the alternatives I'm about to mention. So, anyways, I'd say the alternatives worth looking at are:

1. [NovelAI](https://novelai.net/). It's a subscription service, and arguably the best AI storyteller application overall. It has a *lot* of features and customization options, and the models are pretty much the best you can get without resorting to OpenAI. The subscription prices are $10/$15/$25 per month. The available AI models are finetuned versions of GPT-Neo 2.7B, GPT-J 6B, Fairseq-13B, and for Opus subscribers, GPT-NeoX. It (along with every other paid alternative on this list) also has a free trial.

2. [HoloAI](https://writeholo.com/). It's also a subscription service. I'd say it's worse than NovelAI, overall, but it has the advantage of being significantly cheaper than NovelAI. For that matter, it's cheaper than any other paid options that I know of. The subscription prices are $5/$8/$12 per month. The AI models available are GPT-J 6B and, only for Ultimate subscribers, Fairseq-13B and GPT-NeoX.

3. [KoboldAI](https://github.com/KoboldAI/KoboldAI-Client). It has the best models you'll get out of any free AI application, and more features than what you get with free AID. It's also the only alternative I know of that has multiplayer. You can either run the models locally, given that your PC is powerful enough to do so, or use the [Google Colab](https://koboldai.org/colab), in which case the models will run on Google's servers instead of on your on PC. The Colab also allows it to be usable on mobile. Just note that the loading time for the Colab to start can be pretty long. The AI models available, if you use KoboldAI locally, are literally any models your PC can run, or, if you use the Colab, finetuned versions and base models of GPT-J 6B, Fairseq-13B, and GPT-NeoX.

4. [Dreamily](https://dreamily.ai/). It exists. It functions. It's alright, but nothing special, if I'm being honest. Still, it's a free, easy to use, ad-free alternative. Not actually sure what AI model it uses, but the dev says it uses an AI model smaller than GPT-Neo 1.3B.

5. [TextSynth Playground](https://textsynth.com/playground.html). It's kinda barebones, with less features than any other alternatives on this list. However, it's free and allows pretty convenient access to the base GPT-J 6B, Fairseq-13B, and GPT-NeoX models. There's a rate limit for free users, though. You can also choose to pay per token for a few extra features, and to remove the rate limit.

6. [Hyperwrite](https://hyperwriteai.com/). It uses GPT-3, and as such, uses OpenAI's filter. Here is [OpenAI's Content Policy](https://beta.openai.com/docs/usage-guidelines/content-policy) if you want to know what the filter disallows. Unfortunately, the censorship disallows quite a bit, but Hyperwrite is still a decent option if you don't use the AI for anything that would be against OpenAI's Content Policy. Hyperwrite is usable for free, and allows 1500 outputs per month for free users. You can also pay $10 per month for more monthly outputs, or $35 per month for unlimited outputs.

7. [Sudowrite](https://www.sudowrite.com/) exists. It uses GPT-3 Davinci. However, unlike most GPT-3 applications, it doesn't use OpenAI's filter. According to one of the co-founders, they don't filter sexual and violent content and such, like other GPT-3 applications; just astroturfing. Sudowrite also has more features than most GPT-3 applications I've seen (although, it's still missing some features that are common among other applications like NovelAI, HoloAI, KoboldAI, Dreamily, and AID). Unfortunately, the pricing is kinda ridiculous. The subscription prices are $10/$29/$99 per month, for 10k, 50k, and 200k words per month, respectively. The $10 subscription tier will offer too few words for the vast majority of users, the $29 tier will still offer too few words for a lot (maybe *most*) users, and the $99 tier will probably offer enough words for the vast majority of users, but is also just *very* expensive.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-09-05-103018","1662366618","None","1662366866.0","0","in5u7a6","False","t3_x5u2wx","False","t1_in5u7a6","False","t1_in3aug6","/r/AIDungeon/comments/x5u2wx/ok_wtf_is_that_price_15500_reais_in_a_free_game/in5u7a6/","1665106654","5","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None",""

1. Scripting
I have been trying to implement as little as a breathing system into the world with no success. I just don't manage to make this work. I will of course try to make this work however tips will be highly appreciated.

2. World Info
I don't know how much world info AI dungeon can take however I created 150+ World Infos already and just made a satisfactory base for it. I doubt that once I'm finished WI (world info) AID will be able to remember all of it. Apart from that there are inconsistencies for example AI dungeon forgets that there is a WI entry for flower breathing sixth form and says something like ""Flower Breathing, sixth form, dark plum"" instead of saying Flower Breathing sixth Form Whirling Peach.

3. AID (AI Dungeon) thinking that demon slayers are demons.

When i returned to AI dungeon after almost 2 years of not using it, they've added action limits now. It's sad, kinda disrupting when you're deep into the story due to having to watch ads for actions. 

However, their costs on the AI is huge- they'll have to find a way to somehow lower the costs in order to continue running AI dungeon so they've added action points.

The price for premium is so high even for the Adventurer's monthly. Sadly i can't purchase it as it goes beyond my budget for self-wants.

We'll just have to accept this i guess until they find a new way to have us continuously play without having to watch ads or a new way to lower the costs.

But getting 10 action points per ad is not so bad (for me at least). Sorry my english is bad idk if i explained it right.

Also, the AI has a context limit of 1024 tokens for free users, or 2048 tokens for premium and Steam users. One token is about 3 or 4 characters on average, but that can vary; some tokens are longer or shorter than that. Also, the AI's ""context"" is essentially the info that's used by the AI when generating an output.

By default, in a story that's at least 20 or so actions long, at least 50% of the AI's context will be split between the most recent portion of the story, and the Author's Note, and up to 50% of the AI's context will be split between Memory and World Info. As a side note: It *is* possible to use less than 50% of the context for the most recent portion of the story and Author's Note, or more than 50% for Memory and World Info, but that'll usually only happen at the start of a story. Once the story itself is long enough, at least 50% of the context will *always* be occupied by the most recent portion of the story, and the Author's Note.

With that in mind, for the vast majority of a story, there are only going to be 512 (for free users) or 1024 (for paid users) tokens left to be used for Memory and World Info. And, if the Memory is full, or close to full (which it often ends up being in long and/or complex adventures) it'll likely be using at least 250 of those tokens (Edit: Never mind about it using 250 tokens if ""full""; the character limit for Memory apparently got increased from 1000 to 4000, so Memory can now occupy an even larger amount of tokens depending on how much you put into the Memory).

World Info also has the lowest priority of anything in the AI's context; this means that World Info is less likely to be acknowledged by the AI than Memory, Author's Note, or the most recent portion of the story. Also, if the Memory and activated World Info entries exceed the context's combined Memory/World Info token limit, then parts of the activated World Info entries, or entire activated World Info entries, won't actually be added into the AI's context.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-09-08-131017","1662635417","None","1662637658.0","0","inkobiw","False","t3_x8lgqm","False","t1_inkobiw","False","t1_inj1to2","/r/AIDungeon/comments/x8lgqm/the_world_of_demon_slayer/inkobiw/","1665088280","3","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None",""

You're going to have more success directing the flavor of the story with world info, and the AI will occasionally do brilliant and totally proper things with what you give it, than in trying to stuff the world info with a bunch of specific canon lore for a story.

I learned my lesson making a Shadowrun lorebook, and now all the entries are short and streamlined and I added an always on entry for the protagnist and the world lore and now I get much better results even though the slang and references aren't always canon accurate.

we start out with the child-porn filter good idea in principle (though it can be debated), terrible execution. Everything was censored wanting to get 2 beers? censored because of the number anything below 18 was censored.
Thereafter the majority of people learned it was a demand from OpenAI for using their AIs.
We also learn of a serious dataleak which exposed how much porn was generated in AIDungeon.
During all this you couldn't play scenarios or worlds other people made, that's back now though much more limited.
Latitude decide to cut ties with OpenAI for cost and fans sake which resulted in what most would consider a downgrade of the AIs, add competition in form of novelAI and AIDungeon started to face economic problems.
Next we have the energy and can't say much about that as I never ran out, though allegedly it would take more than 24 hours to refill.
Then we have cut backs unused systems again to save money. 
We did get 2D AIDungeon pixelart which was interesting. 
Later Latitude made a survey regarding ads and decided to add ads to the game which interrupted gameplay though only for free users. 

When again the backlash became too much they decided to make an ad-skip (only accessible in beta-testing) where you watch multiple ads to avoid ads while playing. 
One 30 second ad equals 10 actions, meaning something do/say/story and something the ai do (as long as it's not directly after your action) and redo are all actions. Now you can use scales to buy actions.
They are also mostly ignoring bug reports.

We also have the steam version now which is basically the old free version.

Where you test positive for the furry gene and get transformed into your fursona, then you have the furst day at school/furst day back, scenario(I haven’t decided yet as this is yet to be made) where you go to school after getting the procedure done(the procedure a 2 part process where they first do a surgery that replaces pretty much your whole outside of your body, and modified your brain to be able to use the new stuff that they gave you, like a tail. And then the second part is the injection that they give you either after, before, or during, the surgery, and what it does is it is a genetically modified virus that changes your dna to basically finish up what the surgery couldn’t, like make you actually not a human anymore, and make it so if you have offspring they will be… well like you, aswell as a few other things like making sure that your hair actually is replaced by the animal fur, and that your body doesn’t reject the new changes.) then about a month or maybe a few months later, the furry polotics scenario happens, then around a day or so later the furry rights taken away scenario happens where your rights get taken away, due to corrupt politicians and pressure from hate groups and anti vaxxers and religious organizations, the government makes the decision to alienate these from the inalienable human rights such as life liberty and property under the justification that they aren’t human anymore so these rights shouldn’t apply to them, which then promptly makes them loose the rest of their rights, and then shortly after that is the ${insert cringy furry pun name for a town} scenario where you and your friend that you met at school between the furst day at school and furry rights taken away scenarios. Then basically it switches to an alternate universe/the future, aswell as switching to someone else’s pov, where the food shipment to furtopia was delayed.

They aren’t mutants they are people who were forced to follow their dreams of being an animal, by the government, who then promptly(after a couple months)took away all their rights and then sent them to what is in a sense pretty much a nicer version of a concentration camp, where they are all concentrated there because they are a minority, and they are not allowed to leave, but the government doesn’t do anything bad to them after that, it pretty much just fucks off and let’s them make their own rules and stuff and sends them food and what not because they aren’t allowed to leave, it’s not really so much a concentration camp as it is a small country the size of a city or small town, that is given food by the United States government.
They aren’t being mocked, they are actual furries and that is literally what they call themselves, although it could be used as an insult to them, sorta like the n word, but that is legit what they are classified as, like: 
species:furry/anthropomorphic animal
Race: fox(or something)

And it isn’t hateful content, I haven’t said anything bad about them except possibly the fact that the version in my stories would want to act sort of like animals.
It’s not hate content
It is the story of a good honest man trying to make the world a better place by running for president, keeping his promises, enlisting a talented team of scientists to make this happen, and succeeding in doing so. Then the thing they spent their entire lives trying to achieve, is then corrupted by corrupt officials paid off by religion and hate groups, and that makes them(the corrupt government officials)take away the basic human rights of the new minority that the president helped create, and then they(still the corrupt government officials) send them all to a concentration camp, and then leave them be, and then a food shipment doesn’t arrive, either intentionally or not, and the people in the concentration camp either hunt for food, starve, or eat eachother until the next shipment arrives, it’s a story of a minority that is continuously fucked with, by the government

I've played NovelAI but IMHO their AI (Euterpe...never tried Krake) couldn't hold a candle to GPT-3.  Honestly, if you want my opinion...**NovelAI is significantly overpriced when compared to the old AID** (access to the old GPT-3 Dragon could be as cheap as $10.  Yes, I know Latitude was losing money when OpenAI started filtering content).

Latitude did indicate previously that they would replace Jurassic-1 although with what is still unknown.  My guess would be they stick with AI21 labs and Dragon will eventually be their Jurassic-X model.

I know which one I'm more inclined to believe is an accurate portrayal of furry subculture.

I've seen the whole spiel before, about how furries aren't in it for the porn, how it's not a fetish, it's a wholesome community.
Go check out the aftermath reports of any furry convention. There was a recent one where the hotel had to tell convention goers to stop banging each other in public areas.

The best thing you can do is describe the character as simply as you can, ignoring or editing AI errors. (You are Blah, the pale vampire.)

Also, you can use character attributes as you write your input. (You smile creepily, showing off your sharp fangs.)

An even better way, use character prototypes that the AI already knows. (Vampires, dragons, princesses, or other characters that you've met often during the game and that have been generated by the AI).

The more information you have about your character in your story, the more likely it will generate the correct result.

Sometimes I use AN to briefly describe a character and situation. (You are Blah, a pale vampire traveling through the kingdom.) Or I add, tags and genre, (Tags: vampires, demons, heroes, adventurers. Genre: fantasy.).

Not anymore, at least not here. I've got other tools I can use anyways. I've honestly just been sticking with AID because it was really convenient and I liked watching the new features come out.

I was paying $15 a month for a service I honestly didn't even use every month. I was willing to do that because it made me happy and I liked having a feeling of special access without any restrictions.  


You can't convince me that I was costing you more than about $1 a month on average.  


Could my needs be filled with the limited use plan? I honestly don't care.

The higher parameter models are a little better at avoiding logical inconsistencies like your knight example, but they are not a lot better at following rules when those rules go against their weights.

Since it is more common for characters in the training data to be able to use their arms than not, it takes a lot of reinforcement in context to get the models to generate output consistent with a character having their arms bound.

Anyway, I just went ahead and collected a bunch of advisory articles, which will help you. So if you've got time, try out their methods.

[This is the article for making effective use of Author Note feature.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CKLFeNFk_oswnpIsvrBJlDfAdBoJUw41ctxBTlnYOeE/edit) It helps AI understand what kind of story or writing style you want to play.

AI apparently uses the information you input in creating plots so it's important. Not as much as its randomness.

`You are ${Your name:}, an anthropomorphic fox who has agreed to go hiking on ${Title of the trail:} with his human buddy named ${buddy's name}. Standing at the beginning of the trail you tap your paw impatiently, waiting for ${buddy's name} to arrive. Finally after hours you see ${buddy's name} slowly walking towards you with a giant backpack on ${his/her:} back.`

`""Ready to start the hike?"" ${buddy's name} says, clearly out of breath.`

`""Yes, I've only been waiting for 3 hours."" you say sarcastically.`

`""Hey, why is your backpack so small compared to mine, this is a hard hike, ya know."" ${buddy's name} says breathlessly, lowering ${his/her:} monstrously large backpack to the ground.`

`""Yeah, for a human maybe."" you say.`

`""What's… what's that supposed to mean?"" ${buddy's name} asks with confusion.`

`""Oh, well, it's just my body is… It's literally designed for that sort of thing, as wilderness survival, you know."" you say as if bragging.`

`""Oh come on dude, just cause you got surgery that made you into a fox a while ago doesn't mean your better than me."" ${buddy's name} says.`

`""We'll see..."" you say, as you both start your long walk on the trail.`

`A couple of hours later as you are hiking up one of the mountains on the trail, you suddenly encounter a mountain lion.`

`""Aaahhh a mountain lion! Oh God, we're gonna die!"" ${buddy's name} babbles loudly, with a note of fear in ${his/her:} voice.`

`""Let me handle this ok."" you say, dropping your backpack and getting down on all fours.`

`You start barking at the mountain lion.`

`It doesn't work. Eventually the mountain lion charges at you, and like a badass, you swipe at the mountain lions side while doing a sick backflip of course. Landing on the ground, you spin around just in time to catch the mountain lion pouncing on you.`

`You rip and tear and bite at it until it's unable to fight, then you just pick up its corpse, and drop it off the side of the mountain.`

`You put on your pack again and see ${buddy's name} just standing there. Stunned by your awesomeness.`

`""So, you were saying something about how I'm not better than you at this just because I got surgically turned into a fox person?"" you say smugly.`

`""Uhhh... ${Your name:} ya got blood on your... snout. Am I saying that correctly?"" ${buddy's name} says.`

`You just shrug it off, ""Eh, ok."" you say casually and keep walking.`

`About days later and your out of the desert part of the trail and into the tundra part, it's your first night in the tundra and you are lying in the tent you share with ${buddy's name}. ${He/She:} is shivering even under ${his/her:} thick winter coat.`

`""How are you not cold ${Your name:}!? It's like below freezing out here."" ${buddy's name} says.`

`""Oh, I am a bit cold, just not as cold as you."" you say with a laugh.`

`""How!?"" ${buddy's name} exclaims, checking the thermometer.`

`""It's 30 degrees here!"" ${buddy's name} continues, wondering.`

`""I've got thick fur."" you say, starting to stroke your fur.`

`""If you want I could snuggle with you? Would probably warm ya up."" you propose.`

`""Fine, you can try..."" ${buddy's name} says reluctantly.`

`You eagerly are wagging your tail as you wrap your arms around ${buddy's name} and begin making purring(yes foxes do purr look it up).`

`""Oh, wow… your so warm and fluffy."" ${buddy's name} says with kinda surprise.`

`""Yeah, people say I'm like a life size teddy bear."" you say.`

`""This is definitely better than freezing..."" ${buddy's name} says gratefully, as you slide into ${his/her:} sleeping bag with ${him/her:} and start purring.`","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-09-16-144847","1663332527","None","1663357575.0","0","ionqet2","False","t3_xfaj3v","False","t1_ionqet2","True","t1_ionq46u","/r/AIDungeon/comments/xfaj3v/furry_hiking_simulator/ionqet2/","1665040682","1","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

Here is the scenario

Description:

After the furries(please don’t cancel me again ai dungeon. When I say furries I mean people who were the people in this universe that we call furries, who got a transformation to turn them into their animal persona) lost their [redacted so I won’t get canceled a second time] people were protesting and rioting at the nations capitol and like how the southern half of America and the northern half of America did a civil war over slavery, now there’s a civil war but over furries
Be a front line soldier of either the more physically adept super soldiers that are the furries or the more well funded government 
Prompts:
Furresistance: It’s your first day in the furry army and you are excited to have a chance to fight for your rights. “Those humans don’t stand a chance against us” you think to yourself
“Welcome to the furresistance” says the recruitment person. “Now we could use someone like you as a good
paratrooper: Paratrooper. You know since your a…” “I’m a ${what kind of bird are you}” you say impatiently.
“Aaaahhhhh ok, well as long as your wings work and you know how to fly or at least glide, you’ll be able to get the job done.”

Several weeks of training later
“Ok men were above the enemy’s camp, so let’s drop in there and take em out”
“Uhm sir?” Says one of your fellow paratroopers.
“Yes?”
“Uhm aren’t we supposed to have parachutes?”
“Hahahahaa. Parachutes are for people without wings. So the pilots get parachutes cause… well their humans and they lent us their plane.”
“Wait no parachutes!?”
“You do know how to use your wings right?”
“Uhmmm. I don’t. Im a hummingbird and I never figured out how to well… use my wings, I always ran out of energy or couldn’t flap them fast enough”
“Oh…how unfortunate. Well if your wings are still attatched to your body and you can still move them then you can just glide down”
“Oh ok”
“Now all of you out of the plane we’ve almost past the drop zone”
You leap out of the plane with all your gear and you fly down to drop zone, hearing thunderstruck in your head as you do so, like a badass, as you drop down from the sky. After about 30 seconds you deploy your wings and start gliding downwards in a circle. You are now about a mile up from the ${what area is the drop zone}
Memory: You are an anthropomorphic bird paratrooper for the furresistance and are fighting against the United States government in the ${what area is the drop zone}. Your load out is: ${what is your load out} you also have ${what perks do you get for being the kind of bird you are. Ex:eagle eyes or talons or whatever} also due to the fact that you are an anthropomorphic bird, you have wings on your back that allow you to fly and glide.
Sniper: Sniper. Specifically in a snowy region, your arctic white fur would make you almost impossible to see in the snow”
“Thanks” you say eagerly. ‘Man o man i finally get to live out my fantasies of being a sniper’ you think to yourself.

Weeks of training later
You find yourself in the snow covered ${what area are you in. Ex: mountains, or something} you already have a snipers nest and little do you know, your about to get your first kill
Memory: You are an anthropomorphic white furred ${what animal are you} Sniper for the furresistance and are fighting against the United States government in the ${what area are you in. Ex: mountains, or something} you have a standard sniper rifle. you also have ${what perks do you get for being the kind of animal you are. Ex:night vision or ability to easily pinpoint sound(ability to move ur ears around) or whatever} also due to the fact that you are an anthropomorphic white furred ${what animal are you}, you are unlikely to be shot by your enemies as you blend in perfectly with the snow
Front line soldier: Soldier, your ${tactical advantages you have, like claws or what not} would help”
Several weeks of training later and you are on the battlefield.
Memory: You are an anthropomorphic ${species} fighting for the furresistance. You have a standard load out.
Being a(n) anthropomorphic ${species} gives you several advantages like ${tactical advantages you have, like claws or what not}.

Government:

It’s your first day as a ${choose an army profession} and you are briefed by your commanding officer
“Alright cadets. Listen up. The enemy we are fighting is not human, in fact some of them are stronger than us, faster than us and some have special abilities, like turning invisible, flight, having claws, night vision, and better hearing. But, they also have several weaknesses.” As he is saying this he flips through a slideshow showing them using their various powers and physical advantages, then he flips to a couple slides that show their disadvantages. “You see men, and lady, their numerous physical advantages come with several drawbacks. Number 1. They are extremely flammable, due to most of them being covered in either fur or feathers they are more flammable than humans, you could simply toss a lit match onto them and they would go up in flames, we on the other hand do not have that problem so fire is your greatest weapon. Number 2. Their sensitive ears and eyes, now quite a lot of them have those big pointy ears that let them hear exactly where you are, and some of them have fancy eyes that come with night vision, but these also make them more susceptible to flash bangs and stun grenades, as their ears and eyes are more sensitive than ours, also you can use a dog whistle on some of them and it will pretty much force them to drop their weapon and cover their ears as the sound of it is excruciating to them, they can hear dog whistles because they have an increased hearing spectrum, well at least the ones with those big pointy ears do. Number 3. They are fragile, or well the kind of them that are of the avian variety are, due to the fact that their bones are hollow like real birds, which makes them. Light enough to fly, they are weaker and are therefore easier to kill. Now some other advantages that the enemy have are the fact that they can hide in plain sight, by just simply getting on all fours and walking around like an animal would, so don’t trust any animals, not even police dogs or bomb sniffing dogs can be trusted. Also they can hide in the water as some of them have gills or resemble creatures found in water like alligators, so stay away from large bodies of water on the battlefield. Next they can fly, so always keep a good watch on the air as they can swoop in and take you out at any moment, and they don’t even need parachutes, so if you see any larger than normal birds, shoot em.”
You are so excited to kick some furry butt, their not gonna stand a chance

We're working on introducing a new login system and are trying to make sure all the issues with it are resolved before we force people over to it. If you are being redirected to [voyage.ai](https://voyage.ai) for login you are using the old system which we hope to remove completely soon.

One of the issues is that in order to keep your password secure we cannot sync your password between the two different systems. So if you create an account on one system and then try to login on the other you will not have a password and you will have to reset it. If you reset the password to a different one that you used when you created the account on the other system then you will have two different passwords depending on which one you are using.

You can change which login system you are using at the bottom of the account settings screen in AI Dungeon.

Hopefully this odd time of having two login systems will be short lived and resolved to the new system this week.

If you are having any issues during the app loading or logging in process, please report them at [bugs.aidungeon.io](https://bugs.aidungeon.io).","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-09-18-045644","1663469804","None","False","0","iovnhng","False","t3_xg661d","False","t1_iovnhng","True","t3_xg661d","/r/AIDungeon/comments/xg661d/have_you_guys_ever_had_problems_with_logging_in/iovnhng/","1665031300","2","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

The original development had immoral and unethical business practices, doubling down on being a cash-slut with no standards that didn't benefit their pockets, first.

And to reinforce this fact, there's evidence they'd label their paying or none-paying audience, profiling them as child rapists to discredit or de-merit any valuable complaints at them. They literally call players pedophiles for this manipulative tactic of discrediting or disarming any constructive arguments.

While their business practices seem, on the surface, to be less unethical, with its previous leadership fading out, the problem with AI Dungeon is the fact that their business standard is still unethical and how they treat their players has NOTHING to do with ""Owe"" or ""Do not Owe.""

&amp;#x200B;

It's not the player's fault for shitty development, but it's not always the developer's fault for unsatisfied players. The developer owes the player a good product worth a fucking dollar, but a player does not owe a shitty developer that same dollar for a faulty product.

You get cow shit for free, but the price model of AI Dungeon still doesn't guarantee a flawless or effective A.I. Give it three years, maybe it'll be a lot better, even for 'free'

And alternatives are arguably overpriced for results that aren't miraculously better.

All-in-all, you can also presume that players follow the mob mentality of ""This sucks because someone said so fifty fucking decades ago."" and go with that. You could call people idiots.

Yeah that was an unbelievable attitude. Last thing I need is people reading all my input. I thought if I deleted a story, it was gone for good. Apparently not.

I really should leave the product altogether. The writing's on the wall and it's in 20-ft high letters. And that's only after 3 months!

My problem is, AID does text adventure better by my standards. I use NovelAI, and it's great, and I tried KoboldAI and did not like it. But AID... the writing is really bad compared to NovelAI but it just, it's more like playing an old-school text adventure, whereas NovelAI is obviously geared towards writing a novel.

I want to try NovelAI's improved text adventure mode, whenever that gets released, and see how it goes.

Honestly the Q&amp;A felt very weird in that respect. Ryan (head of product) is usually good at deescalating communication. But with Nick (the CEO) you get the feeling he truly does not understand why people would be upset…

&gt; I really should leave the product altogether. The writing's on the wall and it's in 20-ft high letters. And that's only after 3 months!

Has been for at least a year now. You should have been there during filter days/1st security breach/ 2nd data breach… The community was _furious_, Latitude no longer talked to anyone, and people were mostly just waiting for NAI to enter open beta.

&gt; My problem is, AID does text adventure better by my standards. I use NovelAI, and it's great, and I tried KoboldAI and did not like it. But AID... the writing is really bad compared to NovelAI but it just, it's more like playing an old-school text adventure, whereas NovelAI is obviously geared towards writing a novel.

Yeah, text adventure mode in NAI is not up to their usual standards. But once they finished their work on their version of image gen, they should be working on it again. I am uncertain if you still have a sub, but some madlad uploaded a NAI module where he massively overtrained with Latitude's original fine-tune data. Might be worth a shot. However, if I am honest, I would not expect too much and just wait for their text adventure update.

Makes sense. To be fair, NAI is running the same risk once their image gen drops.

General rule of thumb is to write your entries in plain text, not using weird brackets or formatting, and keep entries to a maximum of 100-200 tokens.

(check out [https://rentry.org/lorebook-guide](https://rentry.org/lorebook-guide) and [https://rentry.org/memory-guide](https://rentry.org/memory-guide) \\- the guidance on using plain text comes from NAI's discord. It's all personal preference and experimentation though.)

The AI is only fed 2048 tokens and uses that for its generation.

It takes whatever is in Memory, Author's Note, whatever was triggered in the Lorebook, and finally the rest of the space is used by the most recent part of your story.

So if you have 100 tokens of description in Memory, 100 in A/N, and your story triggers 3 lorebook entries at 100 tokens each, then the AI will take approximately the last 1500 tokens of your story. All of that will be given to the AI to let it generate its response.

If you didn't trigger any lorebook entries, then the AI would take more of your story, 1800 tokens worth.

AID uses the same system, with World Info replacing Lorebook, but most models only use 1024 tokens (Premium users can set Griffin models to 2048 tokens). It also counts tokens in a different way than NovelAI.

Your WI entries might be eating up a lot of the 1024 tokens and that could be why the AI keeps ""forgetting"" your story.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-09-19-175809","1663603089","None","False","0","ip2ty5y","False","t3_xibs6s","False","t1_ip2ty5y","False","t1_ip2exo4","/r/AIDungeon/comments/xibs6s/a_game_that_is_like_aidungeon_but_that_works/ip2ty5y/","1665022984","5","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

I'm not sure if you haven't gotten the memo, but Latitude sells AID, their AI, which is inferior to free and cheaper AI out there, not to mention the more expensive ones like NAI that provide a ton of other options and some of the best AI out there, they have subscriptions, ads, scales (Which, ftr, they have a £100 option for scales), as well as a one time payment steam version, it's not like one guy worked on a free game, and then had droves of people complaining, this is a paid product, which had a community being built around it for 2 years prior to Latitude going tits up.


As a company, Latitude owes literally everything to their customers, or they wouldn't be a company, customers are entitled to consistent, reasonable, and high quality service, which they used to receive from Latitude, and when they stopped, is the reason why they complained, or, like me, stopped paying for AID altogether.

Oh that's interesting. I thought they were both just using StableDiffusion, but it sounds like NAI is doing something else as well?

This really is new ground, in a way; there's always been pornographic drawings but this will be another level. I wonder if either company is really prepared for what the internet will do w/ NSFW AI art generation.

1. [NovelAI](https://novelai.net/). It's a subscription service, and arguably the best AI storyteller application overall. It has a *lot* of features and customization options, and the models are pretty much the best you can get without resorting to OpenAI. The subscription prices are $10/$15/$25 per month. The available AI models are finetuned versions of GPT-Neo 2.7B, GPT-J 6B, Fairseq-13B, and for Opus subscribers, GPT-NeoX. It (along with every other paid alternative on this list) also has a free trial.

2. [HoloAI](https://writeholo.com/). It's also a subscription service. I'd say it's worse than NovelAI, overall, but it has the advantage of being significantly cheaper than NovelAI. For that matter, it's cheaper than any other paid options that I know of. The subscription prices are $5/$8/$12 per month. The AI models available are GPT-J 6B and, only for Ultimate subscribers, Fairseq-13B and GPT-NeoX.

3. [KoboldAI](https://github.com/KoboldAI/KoboldAI-Client). It has the best models you'll get out of any free AI application, and more features than what you get with free AID. It's also the only alternative I know of that has multiplayer. You can either run the models locally, given that your PC is powerful enough to do so, or use the [Google Colab](https://koboldai.org/colab), in which case the models will run on Google's servers instead of on your on PC. The Colab also allows it to be usable on mobile. Just note that the loading time for the Colab to start can be pretty long. The AI models available, if you use KoboldAI locally, are literally any models your PC can run, or, if you use the Colab, finetuned versions and base models of GPT-J 6B, Fairseq-13B, and GPT-NeoX.

4. [Dreamily](https://dreamily.ai/). It exists. It functions. It's alright, but nothing special, if I'm being honest. Still, it's a free, easy to use, ad-free alternative. Not actually sure what AI model it uses, but the dev says it uses an AI model smaller than GPT-Neo 1.3B.

5. [TextSynth Playground](https://textsynth.com/playground.html). It's kinda barebones, with less features than any other alternatives on this list. However, it's free and allows pretty convenient access to the base GPT-J 6B, Fairseq-13B, and GPT-NeoX models. There's a rate limit for free users, though. You can also choose to pay per token for a few extra features, and to remove the rate limit.

6. [Hyperwrite](https://hyperwriteai.com/). It uses GPT-3, and as such, uses OpenAI's filter. Here is [OpenAI's Content Policy](https://beta.openai.com/docs/usage-guidelines/content-policy) if you want to know what the filter disallows. Unfortunately, the censorship disallows quite a bit, but Hyperwrite is still a decent option if you don't use the AI for anything that would be against OpenAI's Content Policy. Hyperwrite is usable for free, and allows 1500 outputs per month for free users. You can also pay $10 per month for more monthly outputs, or $35 per month for unlimited outputs. A Hyperwrite subscription is generally more affordable than using the OpenAI Playground for GPT-3.

7. [Sudowrite](https://www.sudowrite.com/). It uses GPT-3 Davinci. However, unlike most GPT-3 applications, it doesn't use OpenAI's filter. According to one of the co-founders, they don't filter sexual and violent content and such, like other GPT-3 applications; just astroturfing. Sudowrite also has more features than most GPT-3 applications I've seen (although, it's still missing some features that are common among other applications like NovelAI, HoloAI, KoboldAI, Dreamily, and AID). Unfortunately, the pricing is kinda ridiculous. The subscription prices are $10/$29/$99 per month, for 10k, 50k, and 200k words per month, respectively. The $10 subscription tier will offer too few words for the vast majority of users, the $29 tier will still offer too few words for a lot (maybe *most*) users, and the $99 tier will probably offer enough words for the vast majority of users, but is also just *very* expensive. Still, it's an option if you want to use GPT-3 Davinci *without* OpenAI's heavy censorship.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-09-19-234905","1663624145","None","1663624335.0","0","ip4a8bh","False","t3_xibs6s","False","t1_ip4a8bh","False","t3_xibs6s","/r/AIDungeon/comments/xibs6s/a_game_that_is_like_aidungeon_but_that_works/ip4a8bh/","1665021309","8","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

&gt;This device appears to be a VR headset attached to a colander by many wires and cables. A hockey helmet chin strap secures it to the subject’s head. A pair of gloves, connected to the headset by cables, completes the device.  
&gt;  
&gt;To activate the device, place it on the subject's head, put on the gloves and (press a button?). The device will allow the user to permanently alter their genome in any way the user can imagine. The changes the user imagines will be displayed on the VR headset as a preview, and the user can either accept the changes shown, or use their imagination to update the preview with other changes.  
&gt;  
&gt;Tapping the virtual onscreen ‘enable’ button on the VR headset will initiate the genetic alteration process in the user. Simple alterations can take a few minutes while complicated alterations can take up to a week.  
&gt;  
&gt;Once the genetic alteration is initiated, it cannot be stopped. The subject's DNA has been permanently altered, and these changes will be passed down to any offspring.  
&gt;  
&gt;A new change can be undone using the same device, however a user cannot go back multiple steps. ***\\[I don't know how to word this so the AI will understand it - I am not sure if the AI will reliably understand it.\\]***

The thing with tokens is... that's how much information is given to the AI to generate the response. The AI is given a set of text and told to generate/predict the next response according to its model (all the stories it was trained on, basically).

The 1024 tokens includes anything in Memory, anything in Author's Note, the most recent part of your adventure, and any world info entries that were triggered by keywords in the Memory, A/N, or story.

So if you have 100 tokens in Memory, 100 in Author's Note, and your story triggered a world info entry with 100 tokens, then the AI will only get the 700 most recent tokens of your story. 100 memory, 100 A/N, 100 WI, and the rest for the story.

If it hadn't triggered any WI entries, then it would be 800 tokens of story.

Whatever is in that 1024 tokens is all the AI ""knows"" about your story. It doesn't remember or learn what's sent to it. Every 1024 tokens is a new set of information for it, it's like pressing a button over and over. Every button press sends 1024 tokens.

So that's why you want to keep your WI entries short and sweet. It gives the AI important information, but also makes sure the AI can still see the context of your story, so it won't ""forget"" what happened two sentences ago.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-09-21-032725","1663723645","None","False","0","ip9v0qt","False","t3_xji3o9","False","t1_ip9v0qt","True","t1_ip9sa6o","/r/AIDungeon/comments/xji3o9/genetic_resequencer_idea/ip9v0qt/","1665014988","1","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

I probably didn't give it a fair shake - I could have looked into tunings and such. But I was already using AID and NovelAI :D and I didn't want to fuss around learning another system.

Basically what I did get out of it wasn't enough for me to switch from AID. Maybe because I use Griffin-Hydra a lot, and afaik that means getting the more popular/likely responses as determined by user activity. So I'm getting these kinda crowd-sourced responses that you don't get on Kobold. Which is in some ways a better experience.

And another thing I really like is AID's prompt generation. Sometimes it's terrible! But sometimes it's really cool and pulls in stuff from WI and it really feels like I'm playing a customized adventure in a customized RPG setting.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-09-21-033617","1663724177","None","False","0","ip9w70w","False","t3_xhjf63","False","t1_ip9w70w","True","t1_ip9v8dr","/r/AIDungeon/comments/xhjf63/mass_rant_about_ai_dungeon_and_whats_happening/ip9w70w/","1665014951","2","False","False","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

The data security is still questionable, though, given that there was another [data breach](https://help.aidungeon.io/faq/s3-buckets-15aug22) just last month (also, here's a [Q&amp;A Latitude had about the breach](https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/wqofq7/qa_with_latitude_after_august_2022_data_breach/)). The vulnerability that allowed for the 2021 data breach to happen was apparently fixed, though.

Also, a bunch of features were removed, such as the Classic AI, text-to-speech, the quest log, the adventure/hardcore/survival modes, the option to show/hide World Info, the scoring bots, the Posts section in Explore (now called ""Search""), the ""Top"" sorting option in Explore, etc. Energy was removed in favor of ads that you can watch for 10 actions each. The subscriptions are also different, now; the $5 tier was removed, and there's now a $15 tier.

In Latitude's [next blog post](https://latitude.io/blog/more-dragon-updates), they said ""With the higher traffic we had a volume-based discount that we will no longer have since most users transitioned away. Because of that we would now pay the normal token price which is 12 cents / 1000 tokens (which is around 1 action) for a fine-tuned model. That would mean every 100 actions would cost $12.

Given this change and that most users can’t have a good experience with the new filters, Dragon-OA isn’t going to be offered starting in the new year.""

The way it's worded makes it sounds to me like it was Latitude's choice to stop using OpenAI's models (particularly due to OpenAI's censorship, along with the OpenAI models now being more expensive for Latitude than before), rather than some decision on OpenAI's part to no longer allow Latitude to use their models.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-09-22-005621","1663800981","None","False","0","ipe9sgi","False","t3_xke2r2","False","t1_ipe9sgi","False","t1_ipe7h1h","/r/AIDungeon/comments/xke2r2/did_they_fix_everything_yet/ipe9sgi/","1665010003","4","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

He starts defending it in dialogue - ""I let them do what they want, and they can live their lives and they're happy,"" and he's just heartbroken and angry when I suggest that maybe they aren't happy like that. He refuses to believe he's done anything but be good to those people. 

I was starting to trust this guy and then to find out that he had that same ending planned for my character? Completely unexpected, amazing twist, and complete betrayal.

Or another one where my character had asked an old friend for help with a ghost problem. She hadn't spoken to this guy in years, but he drops everything to come and help her. Then he disappears in the course of his investigation into her ghost problem. So I start looking everywhere for him, like, drive around the city, call the hospitals, call around the hotels, etc. Can't find him anywhere. I'm feeling bad because I called this guy in to help and now I think he's dead. But he can't be dead, I need to find him.

There was a bit of backstory to this, where the character had spent years possessed by the ghost of an ancestor (who had possessed her in exchange for saving her life some years earlier). She'd finally gotten free of the ancestor's ghost, but he was a vindictive shit and I figured he must be behind everything that was going on. So I have her go back to where she left the ghost behind and offer to trade her life for her friend's life. And the ghost says nothing, but she ends up trapped in some weird underground lair so he's accepted the bargain. 

Eventually I get out of there, and the first thing I do is call someone to find out if the friend was okay. And I'm told ""We found him. We found him and buried him."" 

He'd been dead the whole time. I had her go through all this crap with the ancestor ghost, she tried selling her soul, she nearly died, and her friend had been dead all along. It was all for nothing. It was so frustrating and kind of heartbreaking. Tried so hard to save this fictional guy.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-09-23-055911","1663905551","None","False","0","ipk5sbq","False","t3_xlf0by","False","t1_ipk5sbq","False","t3_xlf0by","/r/AIDungeon/comments/xlf0by/new_to_reddit_and_this_threadboardetc/ipk5sbq/","1665003088","5","False","False","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

Rule 1: You are ALWAYS Mario.

Rule 2: You collect stars &amp; keys and get transported to somewhere (in actual SM64, it's the room that you entered the painting or the hole from)

Rule 3: Rescuing the princess is the main goal. (In this case, the seven wizards have held her captive, but in most cases, I will introduce Bowser as her captor instead)

Rule 4: There are star doors and locked doors that can only be unlocked with stars and keys respectively. (This goes unused in this session)

Two suggestions from someone trying to get better at building worlds himself. First, the total memory the AI can utilize for most players is about 4000 characters. Those 4000 characters are all that influence the AI for that turn. That includes the memory box, A/N, any WI entries that get activated, and the story itself. Plenty of your WI entries are almost 4000 characters themselves. The AI will either hack them apart, probably rendering them TES themed gibberish, or it will ignore them completely. You can inspect the input for any turn, so I recommend playing the world a bit and checking the inputs after every turn to make sure the context being given to the AI is what you want it to be. I try to keep my WI entries to 400 characters or less, so five or six could be activated without taking up too much space. If the AI has too little of the recent story in memory it will bork things too. The AI will never be able to manage canon accuracy for these worlds, so don't bother writing essays for each location and faction.

The only other thing is totally just a personal opinion. I get overwhelmed when there are so many factions, classes and locations. I've played myself a bit of TES, but there were plenty of options that I had no familiarity with.

Anyway, it's apparent you put a lot of time and care into this. It started a better TES adventure for me than other TES worlds I've tried. Definitely consider revising some of your WI entries, and I think this world would really shine.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-09-27-234156","1664314916","None","False","0","iq5qiom","False","t3_xpqwbi","False","t1_iq5qiom","False","t3_xpqwbi","/r/AIDungeon/comments/xpqwbi/the_land_of_tamriel/iq5qiom/","1664977484","14","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

A good free alternative is Kobold AI. It presents a good number of free open-sourced fine-tuned models (which you can select based on your preference). You can even run the AI locally. Great for storytelling/ writing. They also have an AID-alternative adventure mode.

If you want to try writing novels with AI assistant, Novel AI and Holo AI are great alternatives, they both have adventure modes (not quite good as AID though). Though, their AI may also have the same problems that AID’s AI models have. AI isn’t human so you can’t just hope it to be a human-like mind.

Dreamily is also a good free alternative. The author's notes and world info is weaker than what you can find in AIDungeon, but if you don't meddle with that very extensively, it works well.
