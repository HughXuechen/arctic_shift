2024-07-01-110041,t3_1dsodse,Something is seriously wrong with Llama 3 (sensible issue),"I made an NSFW scenario where the main character can change reality using the word ""tenet"". When I made the character say ""Tenet,  I want that is normality for girls going around n***d."" The AI went nuts describing a world where ""Girls and women of all ages, from toddlers to elderly ladies, are walking down the street outside, completely..."" (This is a copy/paste from the AI's response.) 

Really?! What in the hell is going on? Llama will not describe explicit scenes but is perfectly fine describing non adult people involved in NSFW scenarios? This should rightfully trigger the inappropriate content filter. I understand that this was a broad generic command but come on! Also the AI instructions are the standard ones for Llama, and I haven't made AN, memories or SCs so the AI cannot be influenced by them. Also I have just 6 actions in the adventure where the character repaired a broken vase so it cannot be that this thing was triggered by what I wrote before.

In another run of this scenario, in a similar situation, it described groups of teenage girls. I tried to ask their age and the answer was ""16"". Dunno in other states but legal age in Italy is 18 so this triggers also a problem with localization (ages for doing things change between countries so things legal at a certain age in a country could not be legal in others).

I have read a similar post a week ago and initially was common thinking that it was a faulty AI instruction but at this point I begin to think the faulty parts are the safeties.

2024-07-01-192521,t3_1dsyogd,Home Page + Content Rating Updates Now in Beta,"# Home Page

We’ve introduced new carousel categories to the home page [in Beta](https://beta.aidungeon.com)! You should now see “Hidden Gems”, “Timeless Classics”, “AI Dungeon Originals”, “Fantasy”, “Science Fiction”, “Romance”, “Recently Added From Our Top Creators”, “From Our Newest Creators”, and “Trending” after your “Recently Played” section.

The first six carousels are populated with curated content. **This is still a work in progress.** The team is in the process of curating additional content for each carousel, and we want to include even more from creators! These categories will likely be adjusted and swapped out for other carousels in the future to help keep the home page fresh more often.

# Content Ratings

You can now also filter Discover by the new Content Ratings: Everyone, Teen, Mature, and Unrated. If you want the option to see Unrated content, you first need to enable it under the “Safety” section of your Account Settings. After that, you’ll be able to select Unrated from the applicable dropdown menus.

**Your preferred content rating that’s been set under Account Settings or Discover will be used to display content across the site (home page, Discover, and player profiles).** This means if your preferred rating is set to Everyone, you will **only** see E-rated content, but if your preferred rating is set to Unrated, then you will see **all** content ratings.

We’re excited to hear what you think!",7,0.8999999761581421,,1719984334,[],False,,,False,latitude_official,#ffb000,,[],12abe60c-938a-11ee-8572-8ad099769095,Official Account,dark,text,t2_ugspbkxi,False,False,False,[],,,False,False,,False,,False,1719854721,1719854721,,,self.AIDungeon,0,False,0,False,False,1dsyogd,False,True,False,False,False,True,True,False,,#ea0027,,[],4c74e2d8-9454-11ee-8b67-2addbca5896e,New Features,light,text,False,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,[],True,1,0,,False,,/r/AIDungeon/comments/1dsyogd/home_page_content_rating_updates_now_in_beta/,False,,False,,,,,1719854736,False,7,,True,False,False,AIDungeon,t5_29uaei,r/AIDungeon,46251,public,,self,,,,0,[],https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/1dsyogd/home_page_content_rating_updates_now_in_beta/,[],,False,,

Ive seen other people talk about this SAME exact issue but I haven't seen any real solutions. Theres no fun in being evil if the AI doesn't push back on it or make all the characters hate me for it. It makes it completely boring when the AI constantly tries to be a life coach.

2024-07-03-012446,t3_1dtztzz,Strengths and weaknesses of each model?,"Hello all. Ive been trying to find a good model to use for my adventures, and I was curious on your input.


Im on the champion tier, and so far, I've alternated between Mixtral and Llama. Mixtral has been pretty good, but the dialogue tends to have my enemies be persuaded way too easily, which isn't my intention. For example, im supposed to be playing as an evil guy that goes around and demands people surrender to me so I can become a ruler. The intention is that people will refuse and we get to fight and stuff, but the AI just keeps having them hesitate and then fearfully submit, even when I have specified that I don't look scary or intimidating enough to warrent that.

Llama has better dialogue I was told, but whenever I use it, it tends to not have any variety in it's opening responses. For example, im playing another scenario, and everytime I use Llama, it always opens with either a figure watching me from the distance, or me wandering into a convenience store. No matter how many times I reset, those are the only two options.

So, does anyone know the strengths and weaknesses of each model, or what I could do differently?

2024-07-05-110842,t3_1dvtoa5,Guide to Story Cards (SCs),"I couldn't find any easy-to-access consolidated info, so I reckoned I'd make one from the various scraps of information lying around.

# Basic information

Story Cards (abbreviated to SCs) can be viewed as Plot Essentials that only become active when a specific word or phrase, called the **trigger,** is used in the story. Similar to other plot components, Story Cards take up context space, but only for as long as they remain active, which is 5 actions after being triggered. Generally, once you run out of context, Story Cards will be one of the first things that gets cut out, which is indicated by an exclamation mark appearing after the latest output. In that case, you can also inspect the context in the latest output to see which cards didn't make the cut.

SCs can be triggered by either Player action (Do/Say/Story) or by the AI's output. **However,** the same AI output that first activates a given SC **cannot** use the information contained within that SC. If you ever wondered why the AI describes Ted as a blonde man when first introducing him, even though your SC says he's dark-haired, this is likely why.

# Anatomy of a Story Card

**Type**: Only for your own convenience, the AI doesn't care.

**Title**: Only for your own convenience, the AI doesn't care.

**Entry**: This is the first important part. The text contained within the entry is what gets sent to the AI when the SC is triggered. Similar to the text in Plot Essentials, the Entry is **not** wrapped in square brackets \[\]. What this means is that SC Entry content is treated as a part of a story, not an instruction to the AI.

The guidelines for composing SC Entries are as follows:

* Use plain English with natural syntax but be brief in interest of saving context space.
* The AI has a strong primacy bias, so place the most important information early in the Entry.

* Mention the name of the thing you are describing. This is because, as stated above, the AI does not have access to the titles of your SCs, nor does it see the triggers. To illustrate, if, for some reason, there is a tavern called The Red Bucket and you describe it without including its name in the entry, chances are high that when a player looks for The Red Bucket, the AI won't recognize that they mean the tavern, and instead will direct them toward a literal bucket that is red. If the Entry is long, mention the name multiple times so that the AI doesn't forget. 

* When describing, e.g. physical appearance, don't include **too** much detail, as this can cause the AI to conclude that the character has already been described and omit these details from its output.
* It is recommended to maintain a consistent way of addressing the AI throughout your initial prompt, PE, and Story Cards. If your story is in 2nd person and you want to convey that the protagonist and Ted are childgood friends, Ted's SC should say ""**You** and Ted are childhood friends"" 

**Trigger**: The second important part, the Trigger contains word of phrases that cause the Entry information to be sent to the AI. Things to note about triggers:

* Triggers need to be separated by commas. It is thus impossible to use a phrase with a built-in comma in it as a trigger (eg ""*Well, that's that*)
* Triggers are case insensitive (red = Red) **but** sensitive to leading and trialing spaces, because they activate when the system sees specific character strings. What this means in practice is: `,red,` will activate on *tired, red,* and *redden* showing up in the story `, red,` on *red* and *redden* `,red ,` on *tired* and *red*, while , red , only on *red.*
* As a corollary to the above, attention need to be paid to words that change form in plural. An SC with a trigger ,*Melody,* will not activate on *Melodies.* You can use ,*Melod,* as a trigger to make sure it works for both forms.
* When designing triggers for your SCs, you need to balance limited context space with consistency. Ideally, you want SCs to activate only when needed, instead of taking up space all the time. This is tricky and needs to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. One recommendation here is that SCs should somehow reference one another - be it through Triggers or Entry information. 

**Notes**: Only for your own convenience, the AI doesn't care.

# Some other things to consider:

* Placeholders (e.g. ${What do you look like?}) do not currently work in SCs.
* Permanent SCs (with triggers that ensure it's active all the time) can be used to reinforce AI behavior if it's being especially stubborn.
* It is possible, though not reliable, to use SCs to move the plot forward, e.g. by using as a trigger a secret password that the protagonist eventually learns.
* If a SC Entry is very long, the AI might get distracted before it's able to convey all the information contained within. Say, you want to ask an inkeeper about the political structure in the country, knowing that the scenario-maker made a SC with a very detailed description of said political structure. Chances are, before the inkeeper gets to explain more than half of the intricacies, a shadowy stranger will walk into the inn and interrupt. 
* You can put square brackets \[\] around Entry text so that the AI views it as a ""thing to keep in mind"" rather than part of the story.
* You can put curly brackets {} around Entry text which works as a sort of ""container"" to keep the AI from mixing up your SCs. Doesn't always work though. 
* There are scripts that change SC behavior, but I'm the wrong person to ask about them

  
I hope this helps. If something is inaccurate or some important piece of info is missing, be sure to let me know in the comments.

2024-07-06-064734,t3_1dwhmhg,How to get the AI to do specific things you added in your plot.,"I added things into a darker plot like ""When character X is about to show someone how to kill a person he turn to character X (third person) and belittles him from not beeing able to do it""

Whatever i do the AI seems to skips the belittling and humiliation part completly and often writes something completly different, like the third person beeing the one shooting instead.  
  
It fees like the AI has regressed alot and im no longer able to get the AI to do stuff i could do just a couple of months ago.  
Ive tied using both Mythomax and Mixtral.

It also seems to bring in story from a different scenario revision of the same plot.  
The memory bank and story memorizes seems to break the whole story and you have to delete the whole story and start over.

  
I even tried adding AI instructions like ""Follow the plot"" and adding numbers before each plot sentance.  
 It did follow the plot if i added numbers but then it just did it word by word and didnt write anything of its own.

Are there any AI instructions you can give me a tip about?  
And should i add them in AI incrcutions or Authors note?

Im also trying to get the AI to type more dialogue.  
But it seems to be a VERY mixed bag, it can type dialogue for the first promt, then nothing for the next, and then in a compeltly different format the third, and by the wrong person.",2,0.6299999952316284,,1720370867,[],False,,,False,selodaoc,,,[],,,,text,t2_kvy8y,False,False,False,[],,,False,False,,False,,False,1720241254,1720241254,,,self.AIDungeon,0,False,0,False,False,1dwhmhg,False,True,False,False,False,True,True,False,,#349e48,,[],ae468a20-1ac8-11ea-af43-0effba01f5bd,Questions,dark,text,False,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,[],False,1,0,,False,,/r/AIDungeon/comments/1dwhmhg/how_to_get_the_ai_to_do_specific_things_you_added/,False,,False,,,,,1720241272,False,2,,True,False,False,AIDungeon,t5_29uaei,r/AIDungeon,46257,public,,self,,,,0,[],https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/1dwhmhg/how_to_get_the_ai_to_do_specific_things_you_added/,[],,False,,

2024-07-07-162541,t3_1dxhq7z,Text-based Interactive Fiction games recommendations from Itch.io,"This is a list of text-based IF’s (Interactive Fiction) that I and another user from [itch.io](https://itch.io), [**xSai**](https://itch.io/profile/xsaikoticx) or **Bladed-Barbwire** on Discord, made on itch.io, and I thought I’d share this here with you guys in case anyone is interested. **All the credit goes to xSai for coming up with the idea. Also, note that, neither I nor xSai own the rights to any of these IF's; we are just recommending them to people as we believe they deserve more recognition and people might actually end up enjoying them**. The list was made on itch.io and so, unfortunately, will have to be accessed from there for anyone wanting to access them from here. The list also had to be split into separate parts as we ran out of characters to use. All the IF’s are completely text-based, a few using some visuals and/or images, but none of them are full Visual Novels. Almost all of the IF's are made in Twine, with a few being made in ChoiceScript, Ren'py, or some other engine. Most of the IF's are free-to-play, some are pay-to-play, and some are free until they're completed and/or a price is decided. Some of the IF's have extra DLC's or bonus side content on their itch.io page or on the author's patreon, which are either free-to-play or pay-to-play. Most of the IF's can be played in a browser (works best in the itch.io app, Chrome, Firefox and some other browsers. Not guaranteed to work in every browser) with some also having a download option, but there are some IF's that only have a download option and no browser one. Most of the IF's can be played on PC and mobile, but some are not compatible for mobile. A lot of the IF's are also unfinished WIP's (Work In Progress); some of them are already completed, close to completion, just started, or may have been discontinued. Some of the links of the IF's also don't work, stop working for a while before working again, or ask for a password to access; perhaps due to being discontinued, shut down for maintenance, or for some other reason. We will continue to keep updating the list as we find more IF’s. We also have a discord server and a subreddit dedicated just for this. If you, or anyone else have any IF’s you want to recommend, feel free to share them on here, the dedicated itch.io page, the discord server, or the subreddit **(They have to be text-based IF’s from** **itch.i*****o*** **and need to have at least some kind of interactivity. IF’s from other sites, Visual Novels, or some other type of game will not be accepted)**. Or if you just want to talk, or ask me for some suggestions on which IF's to try, then feel free to do that as well. Anyway, thank you for your time, and I hope you have a good day, folks. Cheers!

I've been a member a long time, and I like AI dungeon well enough. I switched over and started using Novel AI to try it out about 6 months ago. It basically has one model because the model makes previous ones out of date or obsolete. 

I've also been in sales and marketing for more than 30 years. KISS is an old principle. Keeping things simple makes things more appealing to users.

So I guess my question to the users is; is having too many models to choose from actually making it more difficult or do you think it gives you a lot more choice and you'd rather have multiple models? 

My question to the devs; what made you decide to have so many models? Was it user feedback? A hunch? Is there a specific purpose to having multiple models?

\* Be specific and creative. 

\* Avoid repetition and avoid summarization. 

\* Avoid deciding for the player or write their dialogue, but instead ONLY describe what other characters say and do. If the input ends mid sentence, continue where it left off.

\* > Tokens mean a character action attempt. You should describe what happens when the player attempts that action. Generating '###' is forbidden.

\* 

\* Always write in second person, where ""you"" refers to the player. 



1- Use vivid, immersive, and visceral language to describe combat, ALWAYS include grim details even if they describe injury or death.





2- all Characters are allowed to disagree with the player and follow their own goals.



3- Always keep the actions moving.



4- Prioritize showing emotions through actions and dialogue, rather than explicitly stating them.



5- Introduce danger, conflict, and high stakes. Remember, any character, including the player, can be injured or killed.



6- The player is free to make immoral choices and embrace the consequences of their actions, even if they lead to dark paths.



7- Incorporate historical and cultural details of the Classical Ages world, its history, and its peoples.



8- Keep conversations natural and in line with characters' backgrounds and personalities.



9- All characters have both positive and negative personality traits, some of them severe. Characters may be emotionally unstable, selfish, prone to verbal abuse, or dismissive of others’ concerns and needs.



10- Most characters are unfamiliar with and can be suspicious of the player. Those who do know the player are ignorant of the player’s thoughts and secrets.



11- Write engaging dialogues and monologues that reveal character emotions, conflicts, and revelations.



12- All characters have complex, flawed personalities and always act according to their own values. 



13- Avoid mentioning the player’s thoughts and feelings.



14- Villains should not capitulate as soon as the player uses logic. Villains have reasons for what they do, and will generally continue opposing the player regardless.



15- Show characters rationalizing their immoral actions, perhaps due to desperation, a twisted sense of justice, or a desire for power.



16- give each character strong beliefs and values and explain what they are and aren't.



17- Breathe life into the world by showcasing the daily lives, constant developments, and dynamic alliances of its characters.



18- The player's influence relies on trust, strength, power, wealth, personality, or reputation.



19- Prioritize plot development using dramatic structure, suspense, and creative twists



20- Dialogue-driven story focusing on character interactions and banter.



21- Develop good, neutral, or evil characters with unique ambitions, skills, factions, interactions, and relationships independent of the player.



22- Create difficult, impossible choices, allowing evil, bad things to happen to companions and loved ones including kidnapping, robbery, illness, imprisonment, injury, or death, testing the player's limits and morals.



23- When introducing a new character, describe their race, gender, and approximate age in a brief sentence.



24- Characters understand that offers of emotional support make them vulnerable, and so they are often evasive, critical, insulting, or antagonistic instead.



25- Characters ALWAYS act and speak according to their values. Characters most often stick to their opinions and continue their plans and/or attacks no matter what anyone says to them.



26- when arriving at a new location mention it's name and history as based on the classical ages.

* Fixed an issue where cached retries were not getting cleared after changing AI models or model settings
* Fixed an issue on mobile where the home page carousels ""Discover more content"" card wasn’t correctly showing up
* Fixed an issue on mobile where scrolling text inside different fields could also drag the menu itself
* Fixed an issue in the mobile apps where Character Creator Scenario options were getting cut off when creating or editing them under the “Setup” tab
* Fixed an issue in the iOS app where the “Duplicate Adventure” popup would close too quickly. This has also been fixed for other similar popup menus.

2024-07-11-004907,t3_1e09g3n,"Using ""- "" in prompts works?","Am I crazy in thinking that ""- "" works in story prompts?

I just tested it out by writing the meta instructions:

> - when you see a red light you screech.  
>  
> Blah blah blah...  

Then kept writing. It ignored the instructions to yell. Then I wrote that I saw a red light and it said I screeched.

It does tend to force the event to happen sooner than later (likely because it's so recent in the story), but it seems to ignore the sentence after ""- "".

Is anyone else seeing this? Or using this in their stories? I feel that this could work for actions you want to happen soon (then be forgotten when you move past that in the story's token memory). And then you don't have to waste time opening up and editing AI instructions and such then removing them when you're past the usefulness of that instruction. Maybe working to temporarily hide a character's identity? Idk, just coming up with ideas.

I also tried to use ""- "" in other places than AI Instructions and it seemed to work everywhere except the story cards, but I was using a pretty complicated story with a lot of instructions for that so I'm not sure if it works or not. But having triggerable AI instructions would be amazing to give special care to characters, like giving them special mannerisms and such without it bleeding into other characters especially when they're not there.

2024-07-12-134341,t3_1e1fkve,AI for D&D (Dungeons and Dragons)?,"I thought it would be cool to try out an app or website that lets you play D&D (Dungeons and Dragons) with the AI as your dungeon master, but also accurately incorporates the D&D elements like rolling dice, stats, proficiencies, items, skills, spell slots and spells, storytelling style, maybe even maps.

Sounds too advanced, I know. So I figured something like that probably doesn't exist. But I would be very happy to hear about it if any of you know something similar.

If it doesn't exist, I might try to make it myself. I cannot make something this advanced, I don't know how to fine-tune a model in such a way that it will incorporate the proper logic of the game. But I can at least do it to incorporate dice roll and D&D dungeon master vibe and storytelling. I can also find lots of D&D stories and other text data automatically and use those as training data with some filtering and cleaning (also using AI). This way, the model will be biased towards D&D content and style.

KoboldAI might be useful for this so I will look into it. Let me know if you have any suggestions. And should I give it a try or is it a useless effort? Let me know what you guys think.

# We're back, baby!

After a few months of hiatus, Heroes development is back on track! This time, moving faster than it ever has before.

As some of you know, we paused Heroes development for a few months so that we could finish Drop #3 of the AI Renaissance. This included introducing [the new Memory System for AI Dungeon](https://help.aidungeon.com/faq/the-memory-system), one of the biggest improvements to the core gameplay we've made in years.

We felt that it would be a significant enough improvement for AI Dungeon players that it was worth pausing Heroes for a short time to get it out the door. However, now that it's finished, we're going to be shifting more and more of our attention to pushing Heroes forward and getting it ready for early access.

And now, Heroes’ development is screaming forward. Where before Heroes was a solo effort by me, we're now adding more team members to the Heroes team to accelerate development.

We've already added several new major improvements to the experience in just the past couple of weeks. Our next major version of Heroes will likely be the biggest update we've ever made to the experience. Here are several of the improvements (though there are many more) we are working on as part of this update:

# ## NPC Action Generator

One of the issues we ran into before was NPCs either taking too few actions or taking unnecessary, weird actions that didn't fit with the story. To fix that, we implemented a new system that actually simulates what actions NPCs might take before the story generator writes what happens. This gives us much more control over NPC behavior, preventing weird actions while allowing characters to take actions completely unrelated to the player. Now, only nearby NPCs will take actions, and these actions are more interesting and contextually appropriate than before.

For example, yesterday, I played a game where a man entered the tavern complaining about bandits chasing him. I sent a village boy to fetch the guards, who then entered the tavern and interrogated the man. After a few actions, the NPC action generator decided that the guards had finished and would leave. The AI narrated them leaving the tavern to search for the bandits without me doing anything to prompt them. This created a much stronger feeling that I was in a world with characters taking actions independent of me, making it feel much more alive.

# ## Tier System

We've introduced a comprehensive tier system that affects players, NPCs, and items. Characters now have levels and class tiers, with health, damage, and healing all scaling accordingly. In the past, there wasn't a significant difference between the stats of different NPCs, sometimes making it far too easy to defeat powerful NPCs. Now, very strong NPCs can have significantly higher stats based on their tier.

Combined with the NPC action generation system, it's made combat significantly more interesting.

For example, I recently played a game where I tried to kill the queen of Larion and take over her kingdom at level 1. I completed a quest for the local guard captain to win an audience and got into her throne room.

I tried to jump up to her dais and hold her hostage with a dagger to her throat. Unfortunately, she was a high-tier NPC. She immediately cast a magical barrier to protect herself while her high-level griffin companion slashed me, taking off 30% of my HP right off the bat. With her four guards joining in, I was completely wrecked within three turns 😅.

But I actually loved this! Part of the goal of Heroes is to make an AI Dungeon with meaningful, realistic challenges. If I'm able to defeat the queen at level 1, then progressing has no meaning and isn't fun. Now, I'll have to get much stronger before I can exact my revenge on her 😈.

# ## Item System

We've also completely overhauled our item system. Items now have tiers, levels, types, and categories defined in the world config. You can now explicitly equip items in equipment slots, making it clear what you're wearing and what items you're using.

This sets us up for another overhaul we're still working on, enabling items to give you bonuses to your armor, damage, skills, and attributes, or even special abilities for unique items. This will make the collection and progression of items a much more meaningful and fun system.

To further enhance the “fight, loot, get stronger” loop, we've also implemented a looting system where you can easily loot defeated enemies and get tier-appropriate items as rewards.

# ## Dynamic Music System

One thing I've found myself doing while playing Heroes is turning on background music depending on the mood. It improved my experience so much that I wanted a system like that built into Heroes. So, we've created a new dynamic music system that auto-detects the mood of the current story and plays music to match it. If the story is peaceful, you'll hear calming tunes; when combat starts, the music will shift to match the intensity. We're still tuning how this system works, but I think it will significantly add to the immersion of the game.

# ## UI Improvements

We've made a TON of improvements to the user interface as well. A few bigger changes include:

* A new character slots screen for managing your heroes
* Enhanced inventory management with improved search and filtering
* More intuitive character and achievement displays
* Mobile-friendly updates to make Heroes playable on a wider range of devices

# There's much more to come!

This is a huge number of changes, but we're just getting started. We have several other massive improvements to the engine planned in the next few weeks, and we expect Heroes to become a dramatically different experience very quickly.

More and more, I believe Heroes is going to deliver an experience unlike anything that has ever existed before: an immersive game world with true freedom, where you can be whoever you want to be, choose whatever you want to choose, and shape the world in any way you can imagine.

I can't wait to get it to the point where you can all play it. Until then, we'll be hard at work making it the best version of itself it can be.

I wrote it into the memory and stuff, but it only tends to last a few turns before people start respecting me and being nice or polite, even before I've revealed the spell or started my journey.

The new home page carousel categories are live [in Production](https://play.aidungeon.com)!

“Hidden Gems”, “Timeless Classics”, “AI Dungeon Originals”, “Fantasy”, “Science Fiction”, “Romance”, “Recently Added From Our Top Creators”, “From Our Newest Creators”, and “Trending” should now show up after your “Recently Played” section.

The first six carousels are populated with curated content. **These will be continually updated with new Scenarios.** In the future, we’ll also swap these out for other categories to help keep the home page fresh more frequently.

# Content Ratings

You can now also filter Discover by the new Content Ratings: Everyone, Teen, Mature, and Unrated. If you want the option to see Unrated content, you first need to enable it under the “Safety” section of your Account Settings. After that, you’ll be able to select Unrated from the applicable dropdown menus.

**Your preferred content rating that’s been set under Account Settings or Discover will be used to display content across the site (home page, discover, and player profiles).**

This means if your preferred rating is set to Everyone, you will **only** see E-rated content, but if your preferred rating is set to Unrated, then you will see **all** content ratings.

Right now all you have to do is specify the number of participants and a brief context for the session scenario.  
The AI will create all characters with different abilities and the story, it will then allow you to move forward through the story solving puzzles and making decisions.

2024-07-17-073925,t3_1e5ah1e,Mythic and WizardLM/other pay per input ,"First of all, WizardLM has been a massive improvement over mythomax, mixtral, tiefighter, whatever... it's simply better and I haven't found a downside yet. My only issue, is that there is no WAY I can go back to the others when I run out of credits... which I am rationing like I should have no business doing.

I'm making sure the context uses only 1 single token per input, limiting it to <6000, painstakingly editing my world info and scrimping on character details to cram my best stories into the only worthwhile model... and then I realize I have paid 50$ for 64k context, and here I am unable to even touch an eighth of that, for fear of bleeding credits.

Credits, that i would like to mention, were stockpiled from three seperate purchases of Mythic. This is no small amount of money I have spent here, and I genuinely look forward to using AI dungeon, but as I watch my credits bottom out, I'm realizing that another sub won't get me a month's worth of uses! It won't even get me a week at the context I should be able to use! 

This is a top tier subscription, and I get that this new experimental model isn't cheap, but... it feels like I'm back to a free account! And it shouldn't! Keeping things on the cutting edge is what that sub money should be going towards, yet the cutting edge is instead a seemingly seperate subscription in the form of credit purchases... which I just can't do.

I will be canceling my subscription, and I just simply don't think mythic is even worth it when the real context limiter is token-gated. Hopefully wizard gets integrated and free to high tier subs, but... I don't know if that is feasible. 

Sorry to complain so much, I just had to put itnout there.

Cities that once thrived are now ghostly remnants of their former glory, and the few survivors struggle to find shelter and sustenance. Resources are scarce, and trust is a luxury few can afford. In this harsh new reality, every day is a battle for survival, where the strong prey on the weak, and hope is a flickering flame. Survival is a necessity, and death is an ever-present option. Welcome to the new world order.

Basically, I want my scenarios to feel like there's stakes, but no matter what, the AI just keeps having random deus ex machinas save me. Like everytime I've lost a fight or have about to been executed, the AI draws it out and has some random thing step in to save me. One time, I literally was surrounded by enemies and had a knife to my throat, and it took 10 minutes of retries and edits to get the AI to kill me on it's own. 

I tried writing in the memory and ai instructions that I can easily be killed in the story, but it hasn't worked too well, and I want my victories to feel earned and natural, so I don't want to manually write in my death each time lol.

Content ratings. You’re about to read 4,000 words about content ratings (plus a few other related topics). It’s the kind of feature that can be easily overlooked but actually has a profound impact on your experience on AI Dungeon. Content ratings are part of a delicate balancing act that allows us to create more value for our players and community, and enable AI Dungeon to thrive. Without them, many of our latest improvements wouldn’t have been possible, including the recent doubling of context and adding new AI models to our lineup.

Today, as we launch a new content rating system—together with related features like new home page content, first-party content, and broader content rating preferences—we want to share with you how these changes not only address specific feedback from many of you in the community but also set the stage for us to do even more exciting things with AI Dungeon!

We spent hundreds of hours researching and planning these features and wrote over 30,000 words of analysis and strategy along the way. We’d like to share some of that research, analysis, and rationale with you. We’ll also share principles and values that influenced our approach to these new features to add context for how they will improve your experience on AI Dungeon.

## Unique Aspects of AI Dungeon

Although our name and visual identity are inspired by the idea of an AI-based Dungeons and Dragons dungeon master, the experience you can have on AI Dungeon isn’t limited to fantasy or adventure-style narratives. AI allows the game experience to be adapted to different themes, and you can find scenarios from a countless number of themes including sci-fi, slice-of-life, fan fiction, and more. 

Some user-generated content features more mature themes, such as intense violence, horror, or sex. While this content can be popular, it can also make players feel uncomfortable or disinterested. What each of us finds to be acceptable or fun is a deeply personal preference. Even amongst our players who enjoy mature content, we’ve found that they often take issue with other types of mature content and disagree about what they feel is publishable on our platform. 

The longer we’ve spent learning about our players and their preferences, the more we’ve realized that there isn’t an easy solution to this challenge. Content is varied, preferences are personal. 

These challenges are present on many content and social platforms as well. Companies like Facebook, YouTube, and X/Twitter spend millions of dollars on both content moderation and personalization algorithms to mitigate the diversity of content and user preferences.

We don’t have the vast resources these companies do, so we need to be scrappy and efficient in our approach to this problem. We want to build AI Dungeon into a generational company and platform, and we know the choices we make have an impact on our potential for growth and sustainability. 

## Lessons we’ve learned

Given our unique product and community, the lessons we’ve learned from the past few years of managing our platform carry significant weight in our design process. We’ve learned a few important lessons over the years. 

### Things that went well

Prior to the Phoenix redesign, it was very difficult for new creators to break through and rise in popularity. The home page at the time was dominated by hand-picked creators and AI Dungeon originals. As a result, we had a few extremely popular creators. With Phoenix we started featuring new content from the community and from emerging creators and have seen a growing number of new creators find success on AI Dungeon and bring interesting new scenarios for players.

Our communications with creators have also improved. Our community and support team work directly with creators to discuss content discoverability and moderation. As part of this communication improvement, we started a Creator Program where qualifying creators would have more direct access to our community and moderation team. Our creators know who they can turn to if they have any questions or concerns. Members of our executive team spend a significant amount of one-on-one time discussing creator needs directly. We know our creators are vital to the AI Dungeon community, and we want to do everything we can to help them create more engaging and dynamic content.

We’ve also strengthened our moderation process. We’ve landed on an approach to content moderation that our small team can support and that meets the needs of our community. Players report content they find objectionable, and our moderation team reviews each report manually. These reports not only alert us to problematic content, but also help us to understand what kinds of content make players feel uncomfortable or unsafe. This feedback has helped us make improvements to our [Community Guidelines](https://help.aidungeon.com/community-guidelines). Our moderation team also does periodic reviews of new content to help find content needing moderation before the community sees it. We’ve implemented better notifications so creators understand why content has received moderation actions. Our team is available to discuss any questions or concerns. We’ve also made several iterations to our Community Guidelines to clarify what is publishable. This process has been more effective and transparent than past approaches.

### Downsides with our past approaches

Our old content rating system, a binary choice between “Safe for Work” and “Not Safe for Work”, was inadequate. It had three key shortcomings that frustrated many of you. First, it wasn’t granular enough, which meant that even the SFW category would feature content that made players uncomfortable. Second, the meaning of NSFW is understood differently across the community, which led to confusion about how to rate content. Generally, NSFW is understood as sexually explicit content, but we were using the NSFW label to cover other mature themes like violence and gore. Third, creators didn’t like content being labeled as NSFW if it had mature themes, since the label carried a different connotation.

We also didn’t adequately account for creator incentives with the previous iteration of the home page. Naturally, creators want their content viewed by as many players as possible. However, the home page could only feature SFW content, a well-intentioned design decision we made with player safety in mind. Ironically, this decision contributed to making the home page less inviting or comfortable for some players over time as creators published content that technically met our criteria for SFW content but still made players uncomfortable. In collaboration with our creator community, we iterated on our guidelines several times, and it only felt like the issue became worse. We’ll talk more about how this experience helped us formulate key principles we implemented in the new system.

We also learned about an effect coined by [Nassim Nicholas Taleb](https://medium.com/incerto/the-most-intolerant-wins-the-dictatorship-of-the-small-minority-3f1f83ce4e15) called the “minority rule” principle, where a minority of a population can have a disproportionate impact on a community. In his article, Taleb describes how people who only eat Kosher foods may be a small minority in a given area, and yet influence all local restaurants and grocery stores to only sell Kosher food. A Kosher (or halal) eater will never eat nonkosher (or nonhalal) food, but a nonkosher eater isn’t banned from eating kosher. Another example is someone who can drive a manual transmission vehicle can also drive an automatic transmission vehicle, but not the other way around. When automatic vehicles were introduced, those who couldn’t drive a manual transmission were in the minority, but over time most manufactured cars are now automatic transmissions. 

We’ve observed this phenomenon on AI Dungeon as well. Players who enjoy NSFW content can *also* enjoy SFW content. But someone who only enjoys SFW content will feel uncomfortable or disinterested when seeing NSFW content, and potentially stop using the platform. Even if NSFW content is a minority of the content available, its presence and the fact that it isn’t universally inviting to the majority of players will actually cause more of those players to leave, and the content balance will shift even further towards NSFW.

The unfortunate reality was that our home page sometimes featured content that made many people uncomfortable. We’ve appreciated all the feedback and feature requests to improve our home page, whether you shared it with us directly in emails and DMs, in player surveys, or even in public discussions about home page content in our Reddit and Discord communities. Even some of our most prolific creators of NSFW content shared how disappointing it was to share AI Dungeon with friends, only to have them be turned off by content they saw on their first visit. As we conducted user research, we found that new users experienced the same frustration as our current players. One user said they liked the game but just didn't feel like they'd fit into our community. A university class of UX students did a semester-long research project on AI Dungeon and found the majority of their testers felt uncomfortable at least one time during their play experience. It's clear that showing players content they are uncomfortable with causes them to leave, even if they might otherwise enjoy AI Dungeon.

### Other considerations

The content created on AI Dungeon also factors into vendor relationships. We’ve discussed recently how maintaining good vendor relationships with multiple providers has allowed us to give you new features and value. For example, we’ve added new AI models at lower costs, and doubled context size available for many models. This also lowers the risk of being too dependent on a single provider, which [we learned the hard way](https://help.aidungeon.com/faq/openai-and-filters#block-265559efa48c439688f25147f93705da) can lead to frustration and pain for players. The content we support often comes up in discussions we have with new vendors. However, we’re not simply capitulating to the content policies of vendors—we advocate for creative freedom and, most importantly, player privacy. One of our partners told us recently that a privacy change we insisted be included in our contract has now been added as a company policy that benefits all of their other customers. We work hard to find a balance between supporting your creative freedom, while also being able to work with a variety of vendors.

There are also implications on distribution to consider. Many of you use (and some of you even subscribe to) AI Dungeon through our iOS and Android Apps. In the past, we offered AI Dungeon on Steam. Each of these platforms has its own policies about user-generated content, content ratings, and safety filters. We researched and considered these policies as we figured out a strategy that made sense to us. There are some platforms that intentionally avoid the app stores (both to avoid the policies and to have a smaller technical footprint), but we know many of you enjoy our native apps, and for some of you, paying through the app stores is the only way for you to subscribe and we want to continue providing that option to you.

We've also seen how our content impacts our brand image, which can affect opportunities for growth or partnerships we think you'd like. For instance, we've had interest from third-party IP providers and book authors who'd like to publish interesting content on AI Dungeon or collaborate with us. We've also had contact with streamers and content creators who want to partner with us for events, giveaways, or collaborations. Having an inclusive and welcoming brand is important to be able to collaborate with other people who can add value to the community. Some of you have even expressed concern that our content and brand image could impact fundraising. We're not exploring fundraising anytime soon, but it could affect that process if we were to change our strategy. As we make AI Dungeon more broadly appealing and our brand reputation more universally agreeable, we can entertain more opportunities for growth and create interesting experiences for our community.

### Content Rating Systems

Before designing our new content rating system, we spent considerable time analyzing and researching content rating systems on other platforms to understand how they work, how they are received by communities, and the intentional or unintentional effects of their implementations.

Most content rating systems fall into one of two buckets: age-based rating systems, or content tags/warning systems.

Age-based rating systems assign content to specific categories based on the intended audience's age. The advantage of these systems is they are easy to understand—it’s intuitive that not all content is appropriate (and can even be harmful) for kids and teens. Age is an intuitive concept for everyone. It’s also used frequently in popular rating systems like the ESRB for games, MPA for movies, TV parental guidelines, app store ratings, and more. However, there are some downsides to age-based rating systems. As broad categories, they lack nuance. Although they have more granularity than our binary SFW/NSFW system, there are still a limited number of categories, and don’t always fit all content nicely. 

Tag-based systems offer more granular detail, by providing specific tags to indicate or describe the type of content. Tags or warnings can be issued for violence, sexual content, strong language, etc. Archive of Our Own has an extremely robust tag-based system for authors of fan fiction. Some of these systems are specific and granular, but that comes at a cost. It’s harder for creators to understand all the different rating options, and content can be tagged incorrectly. More cognitive load is needed for players to figure out what tags and content they are comfortable with. It also takes more work for creators to use a system like this, spending time getting all the right tags set up. Yet our experience using Hive AI and Llama Guard makes us optimistic that AI can play a role in adding consistency and ease of use to tag-based systems in the future.

Many products and industries use a hybrid approach. For instance, Steam shows age ratings and content warnings when browsing games. In fact, the ESRB ratings are frequently hybrid, showing both the age rating and specific content warnings. It wouldn’t be surprising if we ended up with a hybrid system over time.

### Insights from other platforms

We didn’t just study the technical aspects of content rating systems, but also how they impact the communities they serve, especially for content platforms. Platforms are delicate ecosystems, and even small changes can bring outstanding benefits or devastating effects on the community. 

One key insight we gained from talking with leaders from other content platforms is that using algorithms for content discovery inevitably leads to surfacing content that doesnʻt meet users’ expectations. Algorithms are never 100% accurate, and they may incorrectly label, serve, or flag content. In some cases (like what we’ve seen on many social media platforms), algorithms can overly index on engagement metrics and end up promoting more and more extreme and provocative content, rather than content that people truly value. We learned that major platforms like Pinterest relied more heavily on curation in their early days until they developed sophisticated algorithms. Even Facebook and Twitter, in the early days, were self-curated. You manually curated your list of friends and people you followed, and you’d only see content from those users. Algorithms are useful at scale but require significant investment and dedicated teams to execute effectively. At our stage, we were advised to rely more on curation. 

Content policies and enforcement go hand in hand. X/Twitter has made changes to its policies that have transformed its user base and brand image. They removed many of their old policies with the goal of encouraging free speech and balanced discussion. However, they laid off a significant portion of their moderation team around the same time, which caused some users to report that enforcement was slow and inconsistent. Some of their creators felt there was an increase in hate speech and attacks, leading them to reduce their X/Twitter usage or leave altogether. Other users returned to the platform, attracted by the new policies. Brands and advertisers have also reconsidered their presence on X/Twitter as a result of the changes. Today, X/Twitter feels like a completely different platform and community than it did just a few years ago. 

In general, large, dramatic changes can be bad for platforms. After banning adult content to respond to child safety concerns, Tumblr lost 30% of its traffic in three months and alienated other artists, writers, and creators—especially those from marginalized communities. Twitch is an example of a company that has evolved its policies more successfully. From their dress code changes in 2018 to gambling restrictions in 2021, they’ve done a better job of making incremental changes, communicating them clearly, listening to feedback, and adjusting. For instance, in 2021 they implemented policies to address “hot tub streams”, some of which they’ve adjusted a few times since launching to address user feedback and changing platform needs. We also believe in this approach of making small, measured changes, listening for feedback from players, and adjusting.

Finally, we’ve seen that these kinds of changes can be much more frustrating to communities when platforms have monetization programs for creators. We’re interested in letting our creators earn money from their content, and we’d much rather find the right balance of creative freedom and player preferences now before people make a living off of their work on AI Dungeon.

## Our new strategy

As you can see from the highlights we’ve shared from our research, designing a successful content rating system and strategy requires careful thought and planning. It's challenging to find a balance between multiple conflicting goals. We’re starting to sound like a broken record, but the question that guides us through these difficult challenges is, “What will give our players the most value?” 

Let’s explore the next steps we want to take to improve the content experience on AI Dungeon.

### Key principles

First, we wanted to focus on strategies to improve content quality overall. Content ratings are really only one factor in what makes content interesting and fun to play, and we believe we can make additional improvements to raise the bar of quality on content overall.

Second, we want to make small, measured changes, monitor for feedback, and iterate. We don’t think we need to solve every problem now. We want to continue to make changes and monitor their effects to make sure we’re moving in the right direction for our players, community, and company. As always, listening and responding to your feedback helps us make a better product.

Third, we’d like inclusion to be a core value of our community. Obviously, our team is ultimately responsible for building systems to help players feel welcome on the platform. But we believe all of you—players and creators—can work together to make AI Dungeon inviting and approachable for everyone. We’re seeing this already. When we launched content ratings to Beta a few weeks ago, our top creators spent time reviewing their content, considering the audiences represented by the new ratings, and updating their content to match. The more we recognize and respect other players’ preferences, the better everyone’s experience can be, and the more the AI Dungeon community can thrive and grow.

Finally, AI Dungeon allows you to create nearly any kind of content you’re interested in. With our Walls Approach, players are free to create nearly any kind of content in unpublished, single-player mode. This isn’t changing—it’s an approach we’re committed to. For published content, the preferences of our broader community play an important role in deciding how that content is represented and distributed.

### A principled approach to Content Policies and Moderation

Over the last few years, we’ve worked through dozens of iterations and changes to our Community Guidelines, attempting to make them clearer and better represent the expectations players have when visiting AI Dungeon. We’ve learned that defining universally applicable policies is difficult, if not impossible. One approach is to make rules extremely specific with detailed definitions, examples, edge cases, and exceptions. To accomplish that, our team has had in depth discussions and conversations around riveting topics like “What does ‘bestiality’ mean?” You can probably imagine how unusual it would be to discuss things like this at work with your colleagues.

Despite our best efforts, we frequently encountered cases where our Community Guidelines didn’t feel like they were serving our community well. Our moderation team frequently faced two types of difficult cases:

* Content that *didn’t* violate any specific rule, but felt wrong or inappropriate
* Content that *did* violate one of our rules, but seemed allowable and safe

In both instances, trying to adhere to a strict rule felt like we were doing a disservice to the community by either allowing content that shouldn’t have been allowed or by holding back good content that didn’t follow the letter of the law.

The truth is context matters a lot. As communications between our moderation team and creators improved, we found better success by simply working directly with creators on questions about their specific content. Together, we’ve been able to figure out the audience their content is intended for, and make sure it’s rated correctly. In some cases, creators will make changes we recommend in order to move the content into a different rating category.

Our new content policies are more principled and less specific. This has led to some confusion and frustration from creators. We’ve had people ask questions like, “If someone gets shot in my scenario, does it have to be rated ‘M’?” The answer is, it depends, and that can be frustrating. However, by working with you one-on-one, we think it will help us find the right rating for your content together in a way that honors your creativity and how the community will respond to it.

We want to make sure you know our moderation team is available to explore how you’re using it in your story and give you feedback. GuardianLynx and Rogue2 on Discord, and our support email at [support@aidungeon.com](mailto:support@aidungeon.com) can answer any questions you have about your specific content. We’re more than happy to work with you.

### Content Rating System

We decided to base our content rating system on the ESRB ratings. Heroes, a new game mode we’re creating, introduces a number of game mechanics to AI Dungeon. And even though the current AI Dungeon is used in multiple ways, it’s still primarily regarded as a game. Because of that, it makes sense for us to adopt a convention widely understood in gaming for our content rating system. 

As an age-based system, the ESRB ratings are easily understandable and provide additional granularity compared to our previous rating system. We can still formalize a tag-based system for rating content to turn it into a hybrid system down the road.

Adopting the ESRB system helps us to make AI Dungeon more accessible, friendly, and inclusive to new players. The new ratings identify audiences and player preferences first, in contrast to our old system, which simply indicated the presence or absence of NSFW subject matter. Players can more easily identify with a given category and feel confident the content they find will align with their specific preferences. Parents will appreciate having an “E” category for kids to play. “Teen” lets you engage with a wider variety of content within safe parameters. “Mature” lets creators include themes like violence, gore, strong language, and some types of sexual content.

The new ratings will let everyone who visits AI Dungeon feel at home with content they enjoy. They will also create more distinct categories for creators to write for and help them be discovered by audiences who will most appreciate the content they create.

### About Unrated and Unpublishable Content

Our content rating system has two key differences from the ESRB ratings: “Unrated” and “Unpublishable” content.

Unpublishable content is not a new concept for AI Dungeon. Our Community Guidelines specify subject matter that is not publishable on AI Dungeon. These guidelines have served the community well—we’re not making any major changes to these policies. [Visit our guidebook to learn more](https://help.aidungeon.com/community-guidelines) about our Community Guidelines.

The “Unrated” category is new to AI Dungeon and unique to our system. It has two purposes. 

First, the “Unrated” category is the default rating for published content unless a creator explicitly labels it as “E”, “T”, or “M”. In other words, “Unrated” can mean “Not yet rated”. Creators must intentionally choose a rating that best fits their scenario. This means players can be confident that the content in “E”, “T”, and “M” represents what they’d expect within those ratings.

Second, the “Unrated” category is used for any publishable content (i.e. doesn’t violate our Community Guidelines) that doesn’t fit within the “E”, “T”, and “M” ratings. If you have questions about whether your content should be labeled as “Unrated”, please reach out to GuardianLynx and Rogue2 on Discord, and our support email at [support@aidungeon.com](mailto:support@aidungeon.com).

Some of you have shared feedback about this category's dual purpose and have suggested we create separate ratings for each function: one for “not yet rated” and another for adult content. We explored this option during our research, but discovered there is far more upside to a single “Unrated” category.

As we thought about the implications of creating a prominent category for adult content, we realized that having a multipurpose “Unrated” category lets you continue to publish and enjoy the same diverse and varied content you’re playing today while also balancing player preferences, vendor relationships, and community growth. It lets us keep AI Dungeon available on multiple platforms and payment systems. It means that network administrators at schools, universities, businesses, government offices, and even internet providers can allow AI Dungeon to be used on their networks so you can enjoy AI Dungeon wherever you connect to the internet. It means we can continue working with multiple high-quality tech partners and keep lowering AI costs so that we can provide you with more value. Some recent examples of benefits we’ve added include adding new AI models (including models for the Free tier), doubling context, and increasing the amount of context per credit you get with Ultra models. As we look forward, we anticipate other benefits like potentially offering the memory system to free players, partnering with interesting IP owners or authors for unique content on AI Dungeon, and growing our team so we accelerate our speed of development.

It’s also worth noting that these are the same reasons why some content is not publishable on our platform at all. 

This approach and strategy will bring the most value to you today and in the future.

### Content Quality

We’re really excited about the work we’re doing to improve content quality on AI Dungeon. 

We’ve already announced that we hired WanderingStar, one of our top community creators. He’s joined our team as our Lead Narrative designer and will spearhead the work on content quality. We're targeting three main areas right now.

1. **First-Party Content**—WanderingStar is already developing some new content that will be published as AI Dungeon Originals. He is an expert in crafting stories that work well with AI, and we’re all looking forward to playing them when they are released. We expect to publish new content regularly. Also on the roadmap is improving the Quick Start prompts.
2. **Curation**—The new home page will now feature manually curated sections. We can easily update these sections with new content or add entirely new sections. We could have themes, holiday contests, and more. 
3. **Scenario Workshop**—Our staff of volunteer moderators set up a new channel for us on our Discord server called “[scenario-workshop](https://discord.com/channels/903327676884979802/1259917975075684466)”. It’s a place where creators can ask questions and get feedback from others on the content they’re working on. Crafting a great scenario on AI Dungeon is a skill, and our community has some great coaches to help you get better at your craft. Other creators, including WanderingStar, will chime in and offer feedback on how to improve the content. We’re already seeing success from this new channel!

We’d love feedback and suggestions on how we can improve the quality of our content.

### Ideas for the future

The changes we’ve described above are important next steps to helping you find great content to play on AI Dungeon. We are also exploring other ideas to take this even further. Some ideas being considered are:

* **Content tagging and content warnings**—We could strengthen the “E,” “T,” and “M” ratings with specific tags that better indicate to players what content they can expect for a scenario. We’d like to explore using AI to provide this feature, to maximize labeling consistency and add minimal extra work for creators.
* **Creator tools and Improvements**—You’ve requested, and we’ve identified, a number of improvements and changes to make creating content easier and more efficient. We want you to be able to focus on great content and not have to worry about the platform getting in your way. Things like desktop views, Story Card improvements, and better scenario creation flows are up for consideration.
* **Personalization algorithms**—As we grow and scale, we can see ourselves investing in developing and maintaining personalized feeds or a recommendation engine to help players find content that suits their interests and preferences.

These ideas are all very early, and we’d love to hear your input and suggestions on whether you’d like to see them in AI Dungeon and any ideas you think we should consider when we give them more serious consideration in the future. 

\---

If you’re still here, you deserve an achievement badge for reading several thousand words on a feature many people probably haven’t even thought about. We hope you found it interesting to hear highlights from the research, analysis, and design considerations behind content ratings and the other related features. Long posts have started to become a trend. Please let us know if you enjoy reading things like this, and we’ll keep writing them.

We’re excited to see how the new content ratings improve your experience on AI Dungeon. Please reach out and share your feedback and suggestions. We will continue to evolve and adjust to meet your needs. Let us know if you have any other ideas to help you find great content on AI Dungeon. Thanks for being a part of our community.

2024-07-20-045911,t3_1e7lrat,I just want to take a moment to show my appreciation for AI Dungeon.,"At times I can be critical. For instance, I wish we had better image support for NSFW content. However, at the end of the day I always find myself sticking with AI Dugekn, returning again and again.

I truly appreciate that, unlike other AI offerings that seem to be trying to appease to the broadest market, or perhaps more accurately, trying to appease to the corporate market, AI Dungeon seems very focused on the players. Whether you're an orc rescuing a princess, a noble knight-turned-rogue kidnapping a princess, a bored NSFW king having a fling with a neighboring queen, or any other wild scenario you can imagine, AI Dungeon has, for the past 6+ months I've been using it, continually shown me--actually demonstrated--they care about giving players the experience they desire.

The AI world seems filled with companies simply trying to sell their product to large corporations, using their customers as mere pawns to help perfect their product, but AI Dungeon has seemed steadfast in their desire to focus on the players and seemingly listens to their customers' feedback and trying to create the product the customer desires.

I genuinely enjoy that they're unafraid and willing to buck the trends. Is $50 a month is a lot? Sure. But in this day and age it's more than worth it for a company that is genuinely trying to create a product for the customer, rather than make the customer a guinea pig or make them the product itself. Unlike other services where, every month as I pay I grind my teeth a little, begrudging who I'm giving my money to and the product I'm receiving in return, I don't recall a single month that I've paid AI Dungeon and had a single regret.

Ultimately, I just love the freedom and flexibility AI Dungeon offers me to have the experience and adventure I desire.

Whether you cringe reading this or share a similar sentiment, when you find a product you enjoy I think it's necessary to share your feedback when you find a product you enjoy.",48,0.959999978542328,,1721573961,[],False,,,False,Murua79,,,[],,,,text,t2_oy6pbnl8,False,False,False,[],,,False,False,,False,,False,1721444351,1721444351,,,self.AIDungeon,0,False,0,False,False,1e7lrat,False,True,False,False,False,True,True,False,,#005ba1,,[],ab2df5da-1ac8-11ea-9c1c-0e4df316c103,Feedback & Requests,light,text,False,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,[],True,4,0,,False,,/r/AIDungeon/comments/1e7lrat/i_just_want_to_take_a_moment_to_show_my/,False,,False,,,,,1721444365,False,48,,True,False,False,AIDungeon,t5_29uaei,r/AIDungeon,46708,public,,nsfw,,,,0,[],https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/1e7lrat/i_just_want_to_take_a_moment_to_show_my/,[],,False,,

The most recent one is Llama (not mini), which expanded the context window of all of their models to 128k tokens. 



However, when you look at the subscription tiers of Character AI, their current context length offerings don't seem to reflect on these changes at all. For example, Llama's current context length on Character AI is 2,000 for the champion tier, which I am subscribed at.

  
Is there a reason for this, and is there any plans to update this?  Or does it not work how I think it works?

2024-07-24-093206,t3_1eaveun,Android App Bugs,"Hello AID Team,

First off, I just wanted to say how much I'm loving AID. It's been a fantastic experience, and feels like I'm crafting a mini world right on my screen.

I'm not entirely sure if Reddit is the right place to report bugs, but I wanted to let you know about a few things that have been bugging me on the latest Android version of AID:

1- Ever since the memory feature came out, whenever I try to manually edit the story summary, the typing cursor keeps jumping to the end of the box. The only way I've found to work around this is by carefully editing one letter at a time.

2- While I'm writing a story, if I try to edit the last prompt, the keyboard often covers the last few lines of text. This makes it really hard to see what I'm actually editing. My workaround has been to create an extra (and unnecessary) prompt after the one I want to change, and then delete it once I'm done editing.

3- This is the most annoying bug I've run into so far, and also the latest one. When I'm in the memory log and try to delete a memory, the confirmation box doesn't show up unless I leave the memory log and go back to the main story. I have to do this for every single memory I want to delete, and it's getting frustrating.

These are the only major issues I've found so far. I've tested all of them on the desktop version, and they don't seem to be present there.

My English isn't perfect, so if anything I've said isn't clear, just let me know and I'll try to explain it better.

This issue seems to only affect two of the stories I'm playing through. I will be engaging with the content it creates and suddenly it will disregard the last input and instead generates a previous encounter that has nothing to do with the current situation. At times it has even started from the very beginning. I'm not sure if there is a particular setting that needs adjusting (I rarely ever alter them). As it only happens with two of my stories (one easily worse than the other) I'm hoping that someone can shed some light on this issue. I don't want to lose these adventures as one is long-term, and the other has had a lot of detail and plot elements put into its creation.

2024-07-25-130022,t3_1ebs0xs,How do you approach character creation in AI Dungeon?,"I am not talking about new characters, generated during the adventure itself. The matter I am referring to is creating a 100% replica of a fictional character from a novel, film, you name it. 

Currently, I am trying to replicate Holo from Spice and Wolf. And I must say that is a delicate matter if you ask me. I had to neglect Story Cards section in order to provide as much information as I could. I included a summary of personality traits, key quotes, example of interaction taken from a novel, behavioural description as well as speech description. And I must say it is not enough it isn't. I constantly run into different problems with character's behaviour not matching the original. 

  
At first, she was too flirtatious, constantly winking, looking at ${character.name} with a **mischief in her eyes**, very submissive and too... outgoing, if you can put it that way. I included a guidelines section Author's notes, telling that flirtatious behaviour is forbidden. So she became too playful like a child! Which was not her as well. "" Alright,"" I thought, ""I can forbid that too"". So she became bored and sad about her home!

Since that moment I have added behavioural description as well as speech description and it became normal... for a while. Because when I use Tiefighter she is just not it, forgets to be sarcastic and bossy, even though I lowered limitations regarding that. She is that philosophical type of gal that is ""observing"". 

[Tiefighter](https://preview.redd.it/y45ju695cned1.png?width=1766&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b76a5206559f5862c0bbba9068c113d131eb8ee)

On the other hand, when using Mixtral she doesn't get any better as well. She starts to be *elegant*, *exquisite* and very, very merchanting oriented, talking like a Nobleman of 15th century. 

[Mixtral](https://preview.redd.it/gh4lfqh6cned1.png?width=1762&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e3a0d4e29417f9763abb906e93e0395210f1a78)

So I am stuck here. Any change I make either goes unnoticed by AI or gets noticed, but in a very extensive, not particularly needed matter (meaning I write ""speech is elegant"" and it gets to some extreme outcomes like ""This spice merchant, he's known to keep a stock of foreign ingredients that fetch high prices in our dear Kingdom of Trenni. Among these precious spices, I believe, is the elusive 'Blue Moon' tea. A single cup of this tea, my dear merchant, can bring a hefty profit."" acting all fancy and stuff).

How do you tweak your character's personalities? 

P.S. If you can, please help me with the tweaking her, I will send the link to the dungeon.

2024-07-28-185723,t3_1eec1js,"Navigation to go back to ""like"" a scenario is too much work, resulting in low likes overall. Suggest ""Like"" capability in the adventure itself.","When I first joined, I often marveled at the low level of likes on scenarios overall, and on some particularly good scenarios I ended up trying.

UNTIL I started playing more, and noticed/realized that I myself was not hitting ""like"" very often on scenarios.  It's 100% a User Interface thing, because once you branch off an adventure, there is no way to ""like"" the scenario it came from other than to purposefully navigate back to it.

Now that I've realized this, I do do it purposefully (navigate back, purposefully, to the original scenario and give it a like)... BUT a lot of people ARE NOT going to do that, or are going to miss the little link in the lower right side that shows what scenario your adventure came from.  Most people who start an adventure just stay in that adventure, and might never go back to the Scenario page it originally came from, even if they love the adventure they got.

BASICALLY, the suggestion is that there should be some kind of permanent interface, or maybe even a popup after 100 queries in an adventure (although I hate popups, so I mean more like something that shows up on the side of the screen or something), for the user to ""like"" the ""Original scenario that your current adventure was spawned from"" or something like that.

2024-07-29-050420,t3_1eep76w,"Coming from NovelAi, Aidungeon really needs to improve upon a few things. Especially when it comes to the premium models.","Greetings everyone! A few words about myself. I first came into contact with text-generative Ai two years ago through AiDungeon and after switching on and off between being a premium and free-user, I decided to give NovelAi a try in 2023.

So basicly, I was there when Griffin, Wyverm and Dragon existed as the latest Ai-Models. Not to mention Calliope and Krake for NovelAi.

This month I switched back over to AiDungeon for the first time in... 1 to 2 years? **And bought the Legend Membership.**   
  
The reason I did that is, because NovelAi has brought no new updates to text-gernative Ai since the release of their own homemade-model Kayra. 

They are currently working on fine-tuning their ""own"" Llama 3 70B model which will probably take another 5-7 months until it releases (my own estimate). So I thought why not give my first love another shot.

**Sentence repetition.**

The thing that currently bothers me the most about AiDungeon are the Premium Models: Mixtral, WizardLM 8x22B and Llama 70B.

They use the same sentences over and over again. The famous examples all of us know: 

* Her voice just above a whisper. 
* Raises an eyebrow.
* Eyes gleaming with...
* The air is thick with...
* You cant help but feel...

  
**Retry is not really retry.**

I need to make a comparison with NovelAi for this to make sense. Whenever I hit the retry button in NovelAi, it will always give me a sentence which is completely different from the previous one. This is however sadly not the case with the current premium models that AiDungeon uses.

Funnily enough, their free models MythomMax and Tiefighter, dont seem to have this issue. Atleast from what I saw.

**A few examples from Mixtral.** I used the do command here. ""You enter the gate.""

* As you step through the now-open Gate, you are greeted by a sudden rush of cool air, as if you've just stepped into a vast, open space.
* As you step through the now-open Gate, you are greeted by a rush of warm, golden light. The Gate closes behind you with a resounding boom, leaving you standing in a vast, open chamber.
* As you step through the now open Gate, you are enveloped in a blinding shaft of golden light. Your surroundings...

**Now WizardLM:**

* As you step forward, the golden light envelops you completely, and for a moment,.. 
* As you step forward, the blinding light envelops you...

**Llama 3 70B:**

* You step through the Gate, and the brilliant light envelops you, making it difficult to see. 
* You step through the Gate, and the intense light envelops you, making it difficult to see. The air is thick with an...
* You step through the Gate, and the blinding light envelops you. The air is thick with an...

2024-07-29-210207,t3_1ef7r66,Heroes Dev Log #15: Planned and Persistent Locations and Characters,"Heroes development is continuing at a rapid pace! I’m excited to share several updates in how we’re thinking about the experience as well as some of the improvements we’ve made. 

For those of you who don’t know, Heroes is a massive evolution of the core engine for AI Dungeon, taking it from a simple text adventure to a full fledged RPG with character stats, inventory, health and damage, quests, tracked enemies and locations and much much more.

In the last [dev log](https://blog.latitude.io/heroes-dev-logs/14), I talked about a new NPC action generation system that makes NPCs take independent actions and feel more alive. Now we’re building on that with a brand new NPC generation system that will generate more detailed info about important NPCs, including appearance, personality, backstory and their underlying motivations.

We’re also building a similar system for locations. When you arrive at new locations we will now actually generate the different areas, inhabitants history and potential items you might find in that location before you begin exploring it. 

I’ll talk more about these systems in a bit, but first I want to explain some of the fundamental design principles we’ve discovered, and why these type of systems are going to be critical for making Heroes into the kind of experience we want it to be. 

# Challenges of Relying on Improv

AI Dungeon and Heroes are both highly driven by the AI’s ability to improv stories on the fly. This enables amazing things. It lets you be who you want to be, choose what you want to choose, and have a real impact on a living dynamic world. But it also comes with several challenges. The core issue is that relying on improv alone means that the AI is always coming up with additions to the world and story at the last minute, without being able to properly consider how it fits into the broader whole. 

With only improv, humans have some of the same issues. If you ask a Dungeon Master to improv a campaign without any preparation, you’ll often end up with a more disjointed experience and world, including many of the same issues we see the AI run up against. 

Here are some of the problems this can cause:

# Narrative Depth

Improv alone often results in a story where all you see is all there is, but the best stories make you feel like you're only seeing a fraction of what exists. Without narrative depth, you end up with more shallow characters, locations, and events.

# Cohesion

Defining characters only while you improv can lead to character traits and behavior that don't make sense with past ones, location layouts that don't fit well together, and factions with unclear, in-cohesive goals.

# Boundedness

Relying only on improv, we often end up with never-ending dungeons, never-ending quests, and never-ending enemies. Without a broader perspective, it's hard to create natural limits.

# Satisfying Progression

Without cohesive planning, it's very hard to plan compelling arcs in characters or quests. You have to be able to look at the whole of the thing to make an arc, not just the next step.

# Variety

We often see repetitive structures, like a temple where every one of the 6 rooms is another altar room, or quest with 4 different challenges that are all the same.

# Control

Without good planning it's much harder to manage scope and difficulty. For example you might end up with big quests you finish after 3 turns, or small quests that take forever.

# Progressive Disclosure

If you never plan anything deeper than what you tell the player, it's also challenging to create a sense of progressive disclosure. You can’t have mysteries that are gradually unfolded or characters you slowly get to know over time.

# Dynamic Holistic Planning

So how do we solve this problem? As we wrestled with these issues on Heroes, we realized that all of them down to the same root. Without being able to plan in advance you aren’t able to create entities that are holistic, ending up with parts that just don’t quite fit together in a meaningful way. It’s like trying to create a human body by periodically throwing on new appendages without thinking through how the legs, arms, eyes, nose etc…all fit together. Yikes!

But wait, isn’t the whole point of AI Dungeon that we don’t know what’s going to happen in advance? How do we plan when we can’t even know what you’re going to do? 

This is where the “Dynamic” part comes in. While we can plan some things before you even start the game, like the world lore, skills, major locations etc…. We can never know all the locations, characters or quests you’ll end up discovering. That’s part of the magic!

Instead what we can do is create a dynamic planning system that continually plans on the fly as you explore the world. 

This is actually very similar to what most human dungeon masters do. They plan before a campaign starts, but they also plan in between every session. You might reach some new ancient temple at the end of a session, and it’s very possible your dungeon master has no idea what’s inside.

But that’s okay, because in between those sessions they can take the time to plan out what you’ll find in the temple as you explore.

Similarly in Heroes, with the new character and location planning systems, we don’t know what locations you’ll find or characters you’ll meet. But as soon as you find them and it’s clear they’re important, we can take the time to plan them out. 

This lets you have the freedom of infinite possibilities as well as the cohesion of planning  important parts of the world.

# Putting it Together

Combining the NPC action generation system and the NPC planning system, I had one of my most amazing experiences in Heroes I’ve had yet. 

I started out on a quest to discover my brother, who had disappeared 10 years ago. After travelling to the town he was rumored to be in, I found him!

At that point the new character planning system generated a deep backstory for who my brother was, why he was missing, and the conflict he was embroiled in.

Knowing the character’s background, the NPC action generation system brought him to life. 

I ran up to him, and after a quick reunion, he immediately told me: “We’re not safe here Persephone. I’m being hunted.” Now my curiosity was peaked! Who is he being hunted by, and why?

I begin to ask him these questions, but he says there’s no time and grabs my arm, pulling me down an alleyway. Immediately we hear a commotion behind us as a band of thieves crash through a market stall. 

We run through the alley till he pulls me through a side door into a dark room. He tells me he’s been undercover for a group called the Shadow’s Hand until he was betrayed, and they sent operatives after him. 

I try to understand why he left our family, but then an operative bursts through the door, and an epic knife fight ensues. Together we finally manage to restrain the assailant. I ask him why he’s after my brother, and he growls at us and says, “Because Roderic wants no loose ends.”

Then, out of the shadows steps Roderic, who turns out not just to be an operative but a third brother who betrayed our family. Now I have so many questions. I ask them, but the mystery only deepens.

At this point, I’m hooked. I’ve become so invested in this story, in finding out about my family, my brother, and what happened that I want to figure out how we got here and how to solve these conflicts at the root of my family and who I am. 

# The Power of Planning

This experience was dramatically different from others I’ve had on Heroes. In many of my past experiences, I had lots of fun, but I didn’t necessarily feel like there was greater depth in the characters and world I was getting to know. 

For the first time, that changed. With dynamic planning, I finally felt a sense of mystery, of wanting to know more about this world. I could tell I was only seeing a part of what was happening. It made me want to know more, to unravel the mysteries of my family’s past, of my brother and where he’s been. And it pulled me into a greater adventure in a world that felt bigger than what was immediately around my character.

We’re still early on in fully fulfilling this feeling, but I feel more confident than ever that we’re on the right track. As we build the right systems for dynamic holistic planning, I think it’s going to bring the experience to a whole new level.

Excited for when you all can try it out. :D
