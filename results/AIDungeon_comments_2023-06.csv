Velzix clinches his fist. "" That's unfortunate. Guess I just have to kill you again. I hope that wretched demoness is with you...""


Blaze comes out of his trance and looks around. Suddenly he feels an odd malicious and vile yet subtle shift as strange cool waves wash over him like the stuffy humid air on a windy but unbearablly hot 103 degree day. The magnetic feeling comimg from towards the center the nearby city.


Blaze doesn't know why but as it grows stronger he finds himself waking Larissa and the kids. Within a minute the bare essentials are packed and they are on the road.


Blaze carries Lilith as Larrisa carries her brother.


""Just trust me!"""" He says and sprints away from the city. 


As he runs it takes him a moment to notice he is covering a football field every second. 


Suddenly the energy in the air makes Blaze frantic as if death is a frieght train and he is chained to the tracks. 


Pressing harder there's a sonic boom as they break the sound barrier....


A Second later the field of energy fades away. Blaze stops after moving a few more miles, he turns around as an intense burst of the vile energy passes by. Directly after.... A purple twinkle falls into the city. Suddenly a 30 mile wide burst of energy.


Blaze raises an eyebrow setting down Lilith as he dashes forward crumbling a boulder and deflecting several cars and trucks in a split second. The energy shunting the pieces and objected of the city in all directions at supersonic speed.


Blaze let's out a steaming breath as his body protests but holds up.


He Looks over at Larrisa somewhat confused.


She grins. ""You sensed it to then. Glad you're getting more power and abilities back... Tho you should try and calm your energy and hide it.... Velzix can sense it but not locate us... I can't keep masking it for you as you grow stronger."" She says as they move quickly...


....


...


Hours later they stop at a little cabin in the woods after finding it abandon.


Sitting on the couch Blaze thinks back to the start of the zombie plague...

Blaze looks down at the desert, the craft a few miles away as he stands gaurd at a perimeter entrance. 


The loudspeaker comes on again as Blaze turns to watch the road. ""Energy levels stable... All systems.... What is? Anomlous energy detected..."" The lead researcher says.


Looking back Blaze's mouth drops open. A fluctuating barely visible streak of purple energy like an auroura stretches from the sky. It's brighest part near the craft and fading out with distance. The ship's field reacting similarly.


The two fields merge and there's an explosion as the ship is destroyed, Blaze tilts his head, the new field turning a deep purple as it sucks in the blast and let's out a short lived burst of hurricane force winds. 


The object rebounds but returns to a spherical shape as it settles into a calmer state.


Blaze curses. ""They're gonna want me to investigate that.""


30 minutes later the new anomoly is still stable as a car sized robot crawls towards it...Blaze stands in the command center. His CO watching the screen as the rover's sensors take readings...


The CO slams his hands in the table.. ""That's just terrific... Blaze you're at the rear of formation as sniper. Seems we might have an unknown object.... The coats in the lab say it gives off characteristics of a wormhole or portal."" He says


 Blaze turns his head. ""Sir, I'm usually on point. What did I do this time?"" 


""I think I'm not sticking my butt in any deeper than I already am. You're lucky to even be here after your last mission.... Not to mention soldier you don't follow chain of command."" 


""I know but....."" Blaze starts to say.


""You're our sniper! That's all you need to know. We'll talk about your conduct later.""


A few minutes later Blaze is given a strange experimental rifle that's been promising in tests at another site. A 50 cal energy rifle coupled with built in rail gun.


Glancing at the weapon and its projectiles Blaze looks out at the anomoly. ""What the hell does he know about this thing."" He thinks.


Laying down he is surprised when the sights adjust themselves. Eyeing his team through the scope he watches as they approach it...


The sphere sits in a small Crater on the ground and as the team pauses waiting... Seconds pass as the rover vanishes inside the house sized portal. 


10 minutes later it reappears in perfect condition as it's slightly shunted out... It opens a plexiglass covered box with air holes and several birds fly out and dash away....


The team a mile away mount up on their humvees and close in. Similar weapons to Blaze's in hand.


They get to within 50 feet of touching the outer boundary when a thick smoke pours through and quickly covers the team. Blaze switches to thermal and still can't see.


""Response team come in... Response team."" He calls over the radio. ""Dammit..."" He shouts after trying again..


""HQ this is Shadow 1... Communication with..."" Blaze drops his mic as a member of the team appears. Thier body twists and contorts in painful ways as they walk forward....Another appears and seems distraught as they crawl forward.


A member of the hazard response unit approaches and the crawling soldier leaps on him with inhumane speed biting out his throat and eating him alive.


A third member comes out of the smoke and looks over at the lead reaercher a quarter of a mile away. 


Blaze aims rifle at them to get a better look. Suddenly they sprint off making Blaze's blood run cold. The now creature like soldier reaching the researchers in 6 seconds. The crazed and mutated man rips into them easily killing those that try to flee... 


Taking a step back Blaze shakes his head as HQ comes through on his radio. ""Shadow 1, fall back to our position."" 


Blaze looks back through his scope to see the sprinter looking at their wrist screen. Blaze quickly smashes his own wrist device.


""Not sure if they can still read the locations of teammates or not."" He thinks throwing it to the ground.


Peering again he sees the sprinting former squadmate lower it's wrist and look around at the several others. 


Seeing the screen through his scope Blaze curses as the infected run and crawl towards HQ.


Rolling into his back he hyperventilates trying to calm himself. ""I've got to get out of here."" He thinks. 


Radioing HQ he explains the situation.


Seconds later gunfire can be heard as men begin screaming. The radio goes silent and Blaze begins moving away. There's a large explosion in the distance as HQ's biological threat failsafe detonates, incenrating the entire base and testing area knocking Blaze to the ground...

....


Within minutes Area 51 is put under quarantine to contain a biological threat.


Blaze stands in the main underground structure with a briefing room.


A special representative enters the room and gets straight to the point. ""What this seems to be is a virus or bacteria that is capable of turning those effected into what some pop culture would call zombies...."" He pauses


 ""We managed to capture one that survived the sterilization of the test area. Taken into possession just outside the fencing of the second barrier.... We are at this time working to see if a cure is possible. Tho this is like nothing ever seen before.... As you know everything that happens here is confidential."" He says....

...

...


The next day Blaze is walking the perimeter as a healthy human appears, several severed heads slung over their back. 


There's a snap of twigs and they turn in time to see a sprinter burst from through the foliage grabbing him... Instead of biting the man a thick smoke pours from its mouth curling and flexing like a tentacle of smoke... The man screams and the smoke shoots into his mouth. 


As Blaze watches unseen, a pair of red eyes in the smoke goes into the man as several others miss floating off fading away into nothing and the sprinter let's him go....


Twisting and contorting the man's body begins to change as he stands. His build bulking up as he turns to a Juggernaut.


Blaze gasps. ""They thought it was a virus but.. It's spirits or demons. So that's why they get these abilities..."" He thinks never having witnessed a turning event.


Blaze waits a few minutes after setting off an explosive several miles away. Drawing the demonic creatures away.


When he steps inside Larrisa is waiting with arms crossed. ""You really have to see it to believe it. I only knew cause I was part of the first teams back up. We came in from the opposite side and everything went to shit."" She says holding tears.


Blaze closes the door locking it... ""I never knew there was a back up team..."" 


""I was on point.""


""I was sniper, away from the danger... A danger that just happens to hate you, and want me to lead them in conquering Earth."" 


Larrisa sits in the couch. ""Those bastards sent me as a sacrifice. They knew exactly what it was. Knew exactly what energies and effects to look for.... It was only a rumor but...""


Blaze interupts. ""A story of a demon souled human trying to find redemption and meaning. Helped all the world in 4 great cycles, a force for Redemption. Remade to fight for the light... He stays in secret and works with the branches supressing the monsters and demons. Information passed between the world's cycles in some way let's other cycles know who that Human is.... And they....."" He pauses...


Larissa finishes. ""Find and train him to prepare for the next demonic attempt at taking over the world.""


Blaze sits on the floor... ""How the fuck are we supposed to save the world as demons have basically won already.... The world's got what 1/10 of it's 10 billion people left and they. Are the survivors can be picked off by creatures faster than a dragster... Tough as a tank, creepy and see to crawl on ceilings and sense them through walls if close enough... The secrecy, lies and trying to make what a deal with Velzix. They made it possible for him to get here. It's all he needed for another foothold. 9 billion people gone. Half of that in the first couple years."".... ""What can we do?"" He asks.

 

Larissa shrugs. ""I don't know... but we can try...""



Blaze gets up and walks over to the window. Looking into the trees he notices Shadow Wolf walking around. His demon wolf form blending in with the darkness as he keeps watch.



Taking the chance Blaze lays down. ""It looks like we have to try and save those left."" He chuckles.

She hears a voice speak to her from out of the air. ""It's ok. Just kill the little boy and we will spare the humans that are left. If not.... We have maps of every safe house and strong hold. Won't be long before all the humans are gone."" It says to her. 


She walks over by Shadow as he cooks a few eggs for the children when they wake up. ""We have to do it now. We're to kill the boy and come to terms with Velzix""


Blaze takes a shocked step back. "" Are you crazy you can't be serious?"" He asks.


Larrisa looks at him. ""We agreed to do whatever it took to save as many as we could. You said so yourself.""


Shadow scoffs. ""No I didn't. I said we would try..."" He says angerly.  


Blaze grabs Larrisa. ""I'm not going to kill anyone. I can't.""
Larrisa walks away shaking her head.


Finishing the eggs as the kids wake, Blaze salts them lightly and sets the table.


When the kids start to wake up he tells them to play nice and eat. He gets them to help him clean up while Larrisa goes out to her post.


After tiring the children playing catch and keeping them active all day, Blaze lays them down for a nap. Taking a seat in the living room he sits looking at Larrisa for a moment.


Getting up he loses the door to the kids' room, then walks over to stand behind her. ""Why would even think about hurting Johnny?""


""I don't know. It's the demons. The humans turned us into these things. The only way we can stop them is to kill the boy.""


Larissa stands up as Blaze paces the living room in the flickering firelight. 


""We aren't killing the boy. We aren't like..."" Blaze stops.


 ""They meant you."" She says crying.


Blaze thinks it over for a moment and then nods.


Larissa's hand trembles and Blaze tries to take the gun. ""Don't worry. It'll be over in a flash.""


Larrisa pulls the gun away. ""It has to be me that does it."" She says pointing it at his head. ""They said it has to be me and they'll leave this Earth alone. Velzix is alot of vile things but he always keeps his word."" 


Before Blaze can say what she knows is on his mind she squeezes the trigger....


The rail gun sabot zips through his skull and he drops to the floor. 


As his vision fades he sees a menacing figure. The reaper shakes his head... ""You really should learn from your past mistakes. This is the 2nd time I've had to reap all the souls from this planet. The 3rd will be the last. You've lost again Shadow Seed."" The harbinger of death tells him.


Blaze looks at him as his soul begins to separate from his body. ""What do mean?"" 


Death looks him in his eyes. ""She did what a demon wanted. Even let her be the one to kill you. Again... Tho this time.... They planned for it in advance... Cast a powerful spell and made certain actions the final piece to the spell.... A spell cast by the darkness inside... Tho it is true Velzix and his army will leave Earth.... It is only because.....""


Suddenly there's a surge of electricity in the room and Blaze looks at Larissa as she cries. A spark around her head only visible to spirits and magical creatures causes her to writh in agony on the floor. 


Purple sparks come off of her as Blaze senses a struggle within the space mind and soul exist in.


 Suddenly the energy shifts entirely as Blaze watches her mind get sucked into a mental portal and another presence takes it's place as the portal closes.


Larrisa transforms into a jet black wolf demon as the children come out of their room and begin screaming.


Death looks from Larissa  to Blaze. ""Because she will destroy everything. See, that's how they get in, takes a few decades, maybe 100 years or to make the spell and find the roaming portal but once the conditions are met, it's like inviting them in and switches the souls... Speaking of which, you're gonna feel... Alot of pain once you fully separate....


Suddenly everything is black as pain like that of billions crushes and rips at him. 

 

Blaze struggles against the gateway like a trapped animal as it grows more vivid, more clear with intensity, a voice speaks to him. ""Stop struggling, Let Go."" 


Blaze obeys. He lets go and it takes everything in him to do it. The pain is so intense he blacks out.


""Technically you failed but.... Let's see how you do in this universe. It's a little different. Tho you'll have to come back to the previous universe. Larissa's soul is in the Void of Darkness and half of it's on the planet ruling over them in Demon Wolf form... You do remember how to guide her back... How do feel about it."" 


Blaze crosses his arms. ""Everytime you say that I end up on New Earth."" He says to God.


""It's the only universe you'll be remade in at adult age and still keep all your memories, you know that. Also has the portals to most universes in it. Tho the great cycle has limited the amount of usable energy. You'll have to bargain with the Syndicate."" 


Blaze looks up into the darkness. ""Those guys are still a thing?""


""They keep doing the same things."" 


Blaze chuckles. 


There's a sudden shift and he finds himself near the portal to New Earth. The 3 cherub guards near it step in the way. ""You know you're not allowed back yet after the last incident.""



Blaze waits a moment as they seem to get distracted...


""Ok. Seems The Creator has sent you. Don't screw this up."" The lead says stepping aside.


""Come on that wasn't exactly all my fault. I shoulda seen it coming. God handled it tho.""


One of the cherubs let's out a grunt. ""Your daughter ate several universes."" 


Instead of arguing Blaze rushes through the portal.","True","False","False","None","None","None","None","0","1685837196.0","2023-06-04-020636","1685837196.0","None","0","1685838384.0","0","jmsyh9a","True","None","t3_13v0m3c","False","None","None","None","[]","t1_jmsyh9a","True","0","t1_jmkm67z","/r/AIDungeon/comments/13v0m3c/shadowverse_zombie_apocalypse_2037_great_palmer/jmsyh9a/","None","","[]","1685837230","False","1","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","1692741231","1","[]"

Keep in the mind that the trial is limited and those will be base models without a finetune.  


I prefer these models when compared with the fabled chatGPT as I simply cannot stand the way openAI models steer the story. J2 models have zero qualms writing about any NSFW topic regardless of how dark or well... raunchy you wish to make it.  


Worth noting though, Dragon J2 is using the Grande model (AI21's 17B) not J2 Jumbo (178B) at the moment. J2 Jumbo does not support finetuning yet, when it does they will likely switch when finetuning that model becomes available.

Have you tried simplifying it to just two writing styles like ""use a verbose suspenseful writing style""?

And maybe not trying to give it two different sections like you did in your example. No difference between action scenes and other scenes. In each scene, go into author notes and change it to what you want it to be rather than giving it 2 sections at once.

Here's an example of how you can get some extra things in there without confusing it I believe.

Use a suspenseful, dark fantasy writing style in present tense and limited third person perspective. Add detailed auditory and vivid descriptions. This scene has a scary tone. Avoid abrupt transitions.

Motives.

So you write all of your writing styles and tone and all of that and then you add something like;

[ Tony is very suspicious of Bob and has a hard time believing what Bob is saying. ] [ Bob is trying to convince Tony that he's really brave even though Bob is a coward that will run away at the first sign of danger. ]

Give each character in the scene a motive. In novel AI the brackets work well for me in this instance. I'm not sure if the brackets work well in dungeon AI. You may or may not need them, but in novel AI the brackets are working perfectly for me. The AI uses what's in those brackets and conforms the characters action and dialogue accordingly.

You don't have to separate it into paragraphs, or maybe you just did that in the comment. If you're going to add brackets or add motives even without the brackets, add them on to the end of that.

Also right after the conversational tone sentence, start the next sentence with ""in this scene"", such as; in this scene Tony and Bob are standing at the edge of the pier discussing the trip there about to take. Or in this scene, Tony and Bob are walking through the forest with their weapons ready and keeping their eyes and ears open for any signs of danger.

By adding something like they're keeping their eyes and ears open for any signs of danger, it lets the AI know that it should consider adding some danger as a surprise depending on the randomness setting you created.

You always want to tell the AI what's happening in the scene and who the characters are in the scene.

So besides telling it about styles and tone and all of that, the AI needs to know which characters are in the current scene, where they are, the time of day and the weather if needed, what the characters motives are which can be separate for each character, and even which weapons they have ready and what they're wearing if you want.

The more you tell the AI about the scene, the more coherent it will be in its responses. If you don't give it very much to go on, then it just tries to make random stuff up that doesn't make sense for the scene you're trying to create.

The last time I used AI dungeon there was only 300 characters as a limit in styles. If that's still true you're going to have to prioritize what you include there and try to put the rest in remember.

I like AI dungeon but I don't like the 300 character limit for styles. Novel AI doesn't have that limit so I've expanded on what I put in styles.

Walking is the only mode of transportation.

The main character's name is Tony.

Tony is wearing leather armor.

Tony's favorite weapon is his assault rifle.

Tony also carries a 10 mm pistol and a combat knife.

Bob it's Tony's companion.

Bob wears leather armor.

Bob's favorite weapon is his combat shotgun.

Bob also likes to hit people with his pool cue.

Random encounters might include any of the following creatures or enemies; deathclaws, radroaches, radscorpions, super mutants, behemoths, stingwings, bloat flies, feral ghouls, Raiders, gunners, Bandits and hostile scavengers.

When Tony is drunk, his aim is poor.

I just made all of those up, but those are some of the types of things you can put into memory. General information that applies throughout the story, not particular to any certain scene. Use styles to mold the scene that you're trying to create.

Also for the sake of the comment, it looks like I created each of those as its own paragraph. They should just be each on their own line, no space between those lines.

Also from what I've read a trailing space is a bad thing. Sometimes on your phone you have it set up so that when you type a period, it automatically adds a space after the period. If the last sentence in your paragraph ends with a period and then a space, and then you hit the input arrow, you've left a trailing space. Try not to do that.

Summon creature spell

Tony has memorized a summoned creature spell that creates a specific creature called a dropling. When Tony cast the spell and summons a dropping, a small Forest creature appears that resembles a drop of water. The creature will explode on Tony's command as he carries it along.

I don't know. Just fooling around with your idea and trying to keep it simple.

In our conversation here there is something I forgot to mention. Like I said if you use author notes or styles to set up each scene, it's more effective.

But, when setting up each scene you also need to disable or enable world info entries accordingly.

Some world info entries stay active because it applies to every scene or the world in general.

But not every character you create or every location you create should be active every time you create a scene.

Any world info entry that is not relevant to the scene that you are creating should be disabled.

Now: 


  What might help would be to affect the writing style. 
It sounds like the AI has the idea (the beast is horny), but doesn't know how you want that information delivered. You could try doing something like putting into the author's note (which basically acts like screaming important info in the AI's face), ""A sensual narrative written in purple prose, where the hero does"" and whatever after, insert your preferred overall story beats; whatever the grand picture the AI should be working toward is. No promises, just something that works for me- fairly tame too, I just can't say I expected to be discussing this online 🤣🤣🤣


For an idea of what's going on, >so you can modify to your liking< I usually string a few descriptors together with a certain framework, so the AI sees in as few words as I can think what kind of story it's writing. The idea, I believe, is supposed to be like an author leaving you a note about what to expect in the story.

 I like to use a descriptor first (sensual in my example: could be fantastical, gritty, grounded, horrifying, etc), then a body framework (narrative, meaning it focuses on story progression and descriptions around you- don't expect that to be super strong though, its not a rule for the AI. So this could also be a comedy, or a diologue, heck, even an X-RATED porno, I don't know go wild), and then I end it with a stronger style editor. In this case, purple prose. It's quite strong on the AI, at least older versions I haven't tested the recent updated Jurrasic 2 model, and it is supposed to really bump up the flowery descriptions (I like having a mental image painted in the writing). Basically try and sum it up like you are sending a bold font advertisement to your scared and confused third cousin twice removed from New Zealand, but can only use an old fashioned telegram system linked in your mothers attic somehow- but sadly you only have enough cash for 150 characters in the letter.


Also, as I think about it, you mentioned the world you're in. I forget off-hand what that one is like, but do bear in mind that the type of world described in the beginning of the story (assuming you aren't that far into it) may affect its writing. For example, you may not easily find a flowery love story filled with sap and cheese in the middle of a brutal, gritty war story filled with violence and death. 
Take that with a grain of salt though. AI does what the AI do.

I'm literally creating a new adventure every time I tweak the scenario card, and running two lines of dialogue repeatedly as a test with different prompts.  But thanks for rushing to conclusions.

Second, I'm looking for a solution that doesn't cause one model to have to rely on reference to another (ChatGPT) because that frankly defeats the purpose of working  in AI Dungeon in the first place and requires repeatedly to have to go back to a secondary source the gin up and reload new characters into AID each time you play...PITA and defeats the whole purpose of writing a scenario ahead of time.

1. A filter to prevent using the AI to write stories involving sex with minors. This is a filter that most people won't hit to begin with. Even if you do, it just blocks the input and gives a warning to the player. Nothing else happens. This filter is in play at all times.

2. Filtering based on user preference. This has three modes: Strict, Moderate, and Mature. Mature is basically un-filtered (except for the #1 filter) and you have to be 18 to use it (click-through age attestation prompt). Moderate is similar to PG-13, and Strict is similar to PG.

On the #2 filter, you can have this set however you like *except* for when you play with ChatGPT. Due to Microsoft policies (they're the ones hosting the ChatGPT model), ChatGPT is not allowed to play in Mature mode.

It's fine?

I've been using aid since before all that stuff and it's fine, or at least I haven't noticed any actual reasonably noticeable degradation in output quality, plus all the people who were using it for CP, despite not making a huge population of users, were very vocal in their grievances, but in the end I'm glad that the filters were put in place.

Go cry, go protest in front of a building, I don't care, because you making a shitty post isn't going to help either.

God forsake the fucking echo chamber below that reflects what this subreddit has evolved to.

I'm sorry that I, somehow, never managed to triggered the filter, EVEN ONCE. Maybe it was luck, maybe it was fucking magic, but years later still, it seems to be fine.

I shouldn't have bothered responding in the first place, posts like these always remind me that responding never leads anywhere, and no changes are made, simply two brick walls hurling words at each other, utterly pointless in arguing when words fall on deaf ears or the words simply glide straight through.

Hopefully one of them can give you some super good advice.

You can get the AI to generate multiple options for you in a simple manner by doing something like this: use story or edit your last action and write something similar to ""here are your choices for the next action"", go down a line and put in a 1, and the AI has a maybe 50-75% chance of generating a list of choices.   
After that, in order to pick the option you want to, just typing in the number won't work as the AI won't understand that. You'll have to re-type the option you want, and then repeat everything over again for the next choice area.

Do: Stop giving Latitiude money. 

You stop giving Latitiude money for a broken AI game. They have less money for development and maintenance. The game gets worse. More people end their subscriptions because they don't want to play a broken AI game. The game gets worse. You stop playing for several months, because the free version is awful.

I have found if you write several lines of dialogue in the PROMPT section, the AI is more likely to pick up and replicate your punctuation choices. Also, be sure to have corresponding WORLD INFO entries that also re-iterate the grammatical rules.

Here's an example PROMPT whipped together for your potential SCENARIO:

>You are bored and lonely, so you decide to join a random chat app that connects you with strangers. You enter your name and press the start button. The app finds you a match and opens a chat window. You see their username: MysteryUser123. They send you the first message:  
MysteryUser123: Hi there.  
\\> You respond to MysteryUser123: Hey, how's it going?  
MysteryUser123: Not bad, thanks for asking. How about you?  
\\> You: Just feeling a bit bored and thought I'd try this chat app.  
MysteryUser123: I know what you mean. It can be hard to find ways to pass the time these days.

In the MEMORY section, you can also reinforce your dialogue options:

>You are in a text chat with MysteryUser123, a person you have never met in real life. You only know their username and nothing else. You can only communicate through text messages. Your texts are marked with a > before the text indicating you sent it.

And you can include WORLD INFO entries for the ""characters"" including the ""player"" protagonist:

>Key: Player Character  
Entry: You are a human who is bored and lonely, so you decide to join a random chat app that connects you with strangers. You enter your name and press the start button. The app finds you a match and opens a chat window. You see their username: MysteryUser123. You can only communicate through text messages. Your texts are marked with a > before the text indicating you sent it. You can ask questions, share information, tell jokes, play games, or anything else that you can do through text messages. However, be careful what you say and how you say it, as your words may have consequences.  
>  
>Key: MysteryUser123  
Entry: MysteryUser123 is an AI-generated character who can have different personalities, backgrounds, and motives depending on the choices you make. They are using a random chat app to connect with strangers for various reasons.  
>  
>Key: Chat app  
Entry: The chat app is a random chat service that connects you with strangers from all over the world. The chat app has a simple interface that shows the username, the message, and the time of each text.

Lastly, to keep this scenario being a conversation driven adventure, you can modify the AUTHOR'S NOTES with prompts like: *Conversational, Dialogue, Texting, Chatty, Verbose*, etc, which will keep the focus on texts!

I haven't played 12v12 so I don't really know how different the mode is to normal Dota but it looks like everyone else is choosing heroes that like to fight earlier in the game.

Phantom Assassin is a hero that takes more time to come online, or really needs to get a headstart to be relevant in the game. She's also a hero that can be controlled very easily by the enemy by being stunned or kited.

It's likely that this may have been a bad choice in this particular game as there's too many other heroes all competing to gain exp and gold in order to become stronger.

The starting item choices were good, but incomplete. The recommendation of phase boots and battlefury is like 50% correct, but also maybe not the most ideal choice for this game mode (as it means less participation in hero kills).

In the end the team that this player is on ends up losing and the player has died 15 times (which is a lot in Dota).

Likely still many on AID because it's free, they are here on reddit too and you're still using reddit. And I would point out that AID was originally trained on content that included CP. They claim to have taken that out, and probably did, but it was trained on that in the beginning.

And you are incorrect, they were at one point reading private stories, that was a big issue a long time ago. Which, they claim they fixed, I will not imply they still do it. But once that trust is gone, it's gone. There were also additional issues related to privacy, but I'm not here to kitchen sink them over past problems.

Now, as for AID's filter, I was one of the people supporting the filter against CP. And I defended them on that one. I think that's the one and only thing that should be filtered out. But then they extended it beyond that, to even things as simple as violence. Which is pretty much a staple in fantasy/adventure stories. (unsure if that was later removed) So when I complain about their filters, it isn't the CP filter I am complaining about. It's the other ones. The ones that reduce the quality of the actual stories being written.

\\-

But yes, if you've only written 6 stories then that definitely is not worth it for you. But for anyone who uses it regularly, it is very worth the price. There's no other smartphone game you can get with pretty much endless content for less than $10 a month. Smartphone games are notorious for being horrible cashgrabs, so the existence of these writing programs on the phone fills the gap that phone games can not.

And I am also a person who plays other games and interacts with human beings. Probably more-so than you do, as I am practically married (Engaged, and we live together), I have multiple separate gaming friend groups, I DM for a tabletop group, and my job is working with people. I also play other games, AOW4 only just came out on the 2nd, and I've already gotten nearly 400 hours in it. To be fair, I do often leave it on while at work, so I can steamlink to it on my phone and get a few turns in during breaks/downtime. But that's just one other game, I play more than that. Gaming is my hobby.

Despite all that, I still get 2-3 short stories a week. But the number of stories isn't the important part, the important part is that it is a cheap smartphone game I can use any time I'm bored, away from my PC and the steamlink app isn't working (As it often is not). Whether I need something to kill five minutes or a couple hours, it fills the gap and keeps me entertained. That's well worth $10 IMO.

And I answered what NAI does better than AID in my first post. Better quality and privacy.

The New Dragon has a serious repetition problem, his memory is noticeably shorter, and he is inferior in his ability to bring up things that are in the ""world creation"" the only thing the new dragon is better cohesion and in scenes that involve more than 2 characters (like a group of adventurers)

Clio is ultra fast, it has a greater capacity to bring information from the Lorebook being able to describe characters, places and etc with much more precision, it has a high memory that sometimes even you had forgotten about it, in addition it recognizes the description very well by the attribute method (probably Kraken inheritance), something the new dragon is unable to do, but sometimes her cohesion is strange and she ends up generating some meaningless things (although this is rare)
