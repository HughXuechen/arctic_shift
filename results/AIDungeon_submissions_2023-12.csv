So, I recently stumbled upon this AI platform called Epicnov([https://epicnov.com](https://epicnov.com/)) and, honestly, I'm blown away. As someone who loves writing and role-playing games, I had to share it here. It's been a game-changer for me, and here's why it might be for you too:  

**1. Incredible Logic, Even Past 10k Tokens:** You know how stories sometimes lose their flow? Not here. Epicnov keeps things coherent and engaging, no matter how deep you go.  

**2. Remembers Everything:** Ever got frustrated when a story forgets its own details? Epicnov's memory is insane – it keeps track of every little thing in your narrative.  

**3. Feels Like You're There:** The level of detail in this thing is something else. It's like the words paint a picture so real, you feel part of the story.  

And guess what? It's totally free to use.  

Now, here's the cherry on top: I've got some invite codes. Epicnov is invite-only at the moment, but these codes will get you in:  

8ycleul4H0JLrTXlyTEr6LLVn2XFIVHC 8ycleuqzKu2IUVUewaImbBeeK6DwRd2o 8ycleuxnETUrZcYKJcsYqnphcXjoxGA7 8yclev3nadq0IspEVj4mfTUxMFLAmoec 8yclev9vaRUjdZ0odVqZMJ6qs1txcoCS 8yclevfvw8vnBUDaP4HtzORiMHOqBgjI 8yclevmbY4kVdAOOjmH7myqMTY7SNU4J 8yclevsd6UZda1EcDE6trNohxaWMknsT 8yclevyfjzKAGyPqtb06CWyIxfRPOfE3 8yclew4lmU9XJY59vjiDl2zOhaJ7Mj3v  

If you're into creating your own worlds or living out cool adventures, you've got to try this out. It's been a blast for me, and I think a lot of you will love it too.

Hey folks!

So, I recently stumbled upon this AI platform called Epicnov([https://epicnov.com](https://epicnov.com/)) and, honestly, I'm blown away. As someone who loves writing and role-playing games, I had to share it here. It's been a game-changer for me, and here's why it might be for you too:

**1. Incredible Logic, Even Past 10k Tokens:** You know how stories sometimes lose their flow? Not here. Epicnov keeps things coherent and engaging, no matter how deep you go.

**2. Remembers Everything:** Ever got frustrated when a story forgets its own details? Epicnov's memory is insane – it keeps track of every little thing in your narrative.

**3. Feels Like You're There:** The level of detail in this thing is something else. It's like the words paint a picture so real, you feel part of the story.

And guess what? It's totally free to use.

Cheers to more amazing stories!

**Tip:  If you need an invite code, feel free to private message me！**

after one month of playing with AI Dungeon, I decided to give it a go and try to create an scenario to publish it. Right now I have +50 cards, but I want to do something more flexible like asking the user to prompt their name, gender, etc, so I have a few questions:

1. I know that AI dungeon has ${[character.name](https://character.name)} variable, but there are more pre-existing variables that the game uses?
2. How can I make that when the user writes their name/age/gender/X, their card automatically updates? For example, if they say that the name is 'Daniel', the card I have for them says 'Daniel is a student from...'? I want to connect the prompt to their card.

So, we all know what AIDungeon is good and ""not-so-good"" at. No hate, it'll always be in my heart, but... I left the game a few months ago tired of hoping and started a personal project to actually play RPGs with AI. It turned out the best gaming experience in my life so I decided to share it. I'm starting to build a warm community and they are liking it, so I think it's time to tell more people.

Now, glossing over the \\*obvious problems\\* that \\*some online apps\\* have, I think the thing I miss the most is an rpg feeling with stats, character creation, dice rolling and stuff like that. I'm also a lot into immersion with dynamic music, fixing memory constraints, imagery and a bunch of other ideas; but that's for the future and we're still in beta.

Anyway, my vision is to create a final solution to this specific use case (rpg), since there are already valuable alternatives for novel writing and such. I don't really care about the success and the number of people I can bring. I just want to build the best community possible and give people this new thing.

Anyway, what I'm currently looking for is feedback and interested people. Let me know what you think. Even if you think it sucks, so I know what to improve. Down here are a list of screenshot from the app.

Thanks!

* Moved the Raw Model Output setting to the Testing & Feedback section instead of Advanced Settings. This is now available to free users.
* Temperature can now be adjusted in smaller increments using the hundredths place
* Fixed an issue where copying and pasting was not working in the settings sidebar, text input, and edit view
* Published NSFW adventures should now show up under the adventures tab on scenarios for players who have safe content search turned off 
* Made some auto-scroll tweaks to try and prevent issues that would cause the game to sometimes not scroll to the bottom when it should
* Fixed an issue that caused the scroll-down arrow to never appear
* Fixed an issue where model outputs weren't sorted to prefer lower repetition
* Deleting an image will now function the same as erasing the action rather than completely deleting it forever. This means that undo/redo should now work when deleting an image.
* Fixed an issue where pressing on an adventure on the scenario ""adventures"" tab would lead you to a screen with another list of adventures, even though you shouldn't be able to access a list of adventures from the adventure view screen.

So, we all know what AIDungeon is good and ""not-so-good"" at. No hate, it'll always be in my heart, but... I left the game a few months ago tired of hoping and started a personal project to actually play RPGs with AI. It turned out the best gaming experience in my life so I decided to share it. I'm starting to build a warm community and they are liking it, so I think it's time to tell more people.

Now, glossing over the \\*obvious problems\\* that \\*some online apps\\* have, I think the thing I miss the most is an rpg feeling with stats, character creation, dice rolling and stuff like that. I'm also a lot into immersion with dynamic music, fixing memory constraints, imagery and a bunch of other ideas; but that's for the future and we're still in beta.

Anyway, my vision is to create a final solution to this specific use case (rpg), since there are already valuable alternatives for novel writing and such. I don't really care about the success and the number of people I can bring. I just want to build the best community possible and give people this new thing.

What I'm currently looking for is feedback and interested people. Let me know what you think. Even if you think it sucks, so I know what to improve. Down here is a list of screenshot from the app.

Thanks!

I can imagine how this can ruin stories, because I can imagine that someone creates a cool dating simulator, but the AI hooks you up with someone who doesn’t even exist, and is a flatter character than the ones the person specifically gave you the options to date.   


I kind of expect that the characters I put as story cards will at least be somewhat recurring, as in they are cool people who won’t appear much, but it’s nice to see them in a story. Basically, I’m hoping that they will appear in stories, like a random student that come up in a few scenes, and maybe get the spotlight a few times, but I’m suspecting that they will never be used, and I am worried. Therefore, I would appreciate if anyone could suggest how to make it so that they will appear, even if they are not explicitly stated.","True","False","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","44830","public","None","self","None","None","How do I make it so that the AI uses characters in a story?","None","0","[]","1702142287","2","1.0","https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/18ei848/how_do_i_make_it_so_that_the_ai_uses_characters/","[]","None","False","None","None","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

&#x200B;

* Custom cover image upload for Scenarios and Adventures is now available
* Fixed an issue where most actions in Adventures wouldn't paginate properly after undoing several recent actions
* Fixed an issue where navigation wasn't visible during the Character Creation flow
* Fixed several issues where errors could cause changes to require a refresh before appearing
* Fixed an issue where partial contractions could be treated as valid sentences for post-processing model outputs
* Fixed an issue where when there were multiple spaces after a newline, only the first space would be trimmed
* Fixed an issue where outputs that end in ""says"" could be thrown away, even when they are not hallucinating player dialog
* Non-standard quotes (’\\`“”) are now converted into single or double quotes instead of always single quotes for input (helps with output checking and coherence)
* Cleaned up how output is handled for Dragon, so it should be more consistent
* Fixed an issue where new members were not automatically transitioned to use premium models
* Fixed an issue where output tokens for free ChatGPT users unexpectedly changed from 75 to 45
* Changed the default output tokens for free users from 45 to 75
* Changed the default output tokens for other users from 50 to 75
* Fixed desktop home screen scroll on keyboard key down
* Fixed an issue where scrolling in Author’s Note and Memory would move the entire modal
* Fixed an issue where a space was added before the model output even if the model output already starts with a space
* Fixed an issue where you couldn't exit a new game until you got all the way to gameplay
* Fixed an issue where you could get stuck if you tried to access an adventure that didn't exist
* Errors will now display if you were redirected home from an Adventure that failed to load
* Fixed an issue where Griffin would sometimes output <|endoftext|> tokens when Raw Model Output was turned on
* Fixed an issue where Do/Say actions were sometimes not displaying correctly
* Fixed an issue in the mobile apps where the Plot tab was empty when editing Adventures
* Fixed a crash when you erased a search on mobile apps
* Fixed an issue where Inspect Input would not update immediately
* Added better accessibility for iOS devices by adding support for the container rotor
* Fixed an issue where entering in Scenario variables on iOS would shift the textbox too far out of view
* Fixed an issue where you couldn't always un-tag your content as NSFW
* Fixed an issue where you couldn't publish NSFW content
* Fixed an issue where the ChatGPT image would load slowly due to being a large file size. The image file is now optimized.
* Fixed an issue where copying and pasting was not working in the settings sidebar, text input, and edit view
* Fixed an issue that caused the scroll-down arrow to never appear
* Made some auto-scroll tweaks to try and prevent issues that would cause the game to sometimes not scroll to the bottom when it should
* Fixed an issue where model outputs weren't sorted to prefer lower repetition
* Temperature can now be adjusted in smaller increments using the hundredths place
* Deleting an image will now function the same as erasing the action rather than completely deleting it forever. This means that undo/redo should now work when deleting an image.
* Published NSFW Adventures should now show up under the Adventures tab on Scenarios for players who have turned safe content search off
* Fixed an issue where pressing on an Adventure on the Scenario ""Adventures"" tab would lead you to a screen with another list of Adventures even though you shouldn't be able to access a list of Adventures from the Adventure view screen.

### Memory Retrieval

Heroes now has memory retrieval! Whenever parts of the story are summarized into denser forms, the original is also stored in a memory bank so that whenever we generate story we can pull the most relevant memories in full detail to use when writing the story.

In the future we’ll also use this memory bank to define characters, locations, items and other types of lore in more detail for the AI to be aware of. This will be a powerful fundamental engine feature that will enable a ton.

We'll be publishing a new dev log talking about the Heroes memory system shortly that will go into this system in more depth.

### Engine Changes

Did a lot of refactors on the engine to support how memory will work and to be more elegant.

One tradeoff we made in the process is we no longer store current state and past states in the local storage and instead just store it in the application context. This means that after refreshing undo’s won’t be available. We may move undo saving to the game state saving in the future, but for now this is a necessary change as local storage isn’t meant to store objects as large as the game state has become.

### Misc Improvements

&#x200B;

* Updated nearby character updater to better handle the case of renaming characters that start with generic names (like “traveler 1”)
* Adjusted story planning to try to feel less contrived and always connected to the player / their quest.
* Adjusted how we tell the story generation about the player’s gender to fix it getting the gender incorrect.
* Adjusted custom perk generation to be aware of your gender.
* Changed the GPT-4 turbo model to run through Azure instead of OpenAI
* Adjusted all the story plan settings to be less frequent.","True","False","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","44810","public","None","self","None","None","Heroes Version 0.14.0 Patch Notes [alpha] 12/14/23","None","0","[]","1702580387","4","1","https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/18ifug6/heroes_version_0140_patch_notes_alpha_121423/","[]","None","False","None","None","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","True","This is a smaller update in terms of text, but very transformational in terms of what it will enable in Heroes.

The way it doesn't work is that it just doesn't do anything. If I copy address it is linked straight to the base website: [https://play.aidungeon.com/](https://play.aidungeon.com/)

Another issue is that I can't access my own personal scenarios, adventures, or trash. (No clue what bookmarks are.) All it shows are things created by other people and that my trash is empty.

I'm making [playnarrator.com](https://playnarrator.com) \\- an open genre AI RPG. I've just today added a beta feature I'm calling The Hallucinator. **In a nutshell, it creates images for your story as it goes**. They're rapid fire, but very gestalt. It's kind of like a storyboard for your game as you play it. I like it a lot, and I usually play with narration on.

Here's the launch video I made to accompany it: 

https://reddit.com/link/18irfi3/video/3ohxwmq0vd6c1/player

I have a few AI models available (GPT 3.5, a couple Mistral models, a Hermes Llama 13b) including the NSFW-capable Toppy 7b. Image generation is by default censored, but that can be turned off in the settings if you have an account.

I'd love your feedback on this - I know folks here are big into AI RPGs and I'd love to know how to make this better!

* Fixed an issue where chat models had the wrong parsing behavior in some cases
* Added a loading progress indicator for the initial app load on iOS and Android devices.

It also doesn’t help that somebody had the bright idea to place the global word ban list in the settings instead of being easily accessible while writing.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Been trying to be positive for a while but these combined are making the game very hard to play at all. These are all on my 6th gen ipad, brave browser. These are all single player bugs.  
1. When I press take a turn and want to write my next action, I have to scroll down to the text box in order to write anything, or else I can't see it. By default it should just have you on the text box. This is even worse if you try to edit an action, it will put you all the way at the top of the adventure and you have to scroll all the way back down.

2. When in settings and trying to change the model, the menu that displays all of the sub models (like within griffin there is the two different kinds of griffin) automatically closes super fast, making it impossible to swap them.

3. This is a bug persisting from legacy, but the AI can get confused when undoing things after a lot of retries. Sometimes when you try to undo after a lot of retries it doesn't work (or so you think). For some reason on the screen it doesn't do anything, but after you have refreshed the page or re-entered the story, it will suddenly catch up and a ton of actions will pour in.   
Also I do want to ask, has the griffin AI changed a lot since the beginning of Phoenix?

Swirling energy in the lightless void between galactic dimensions forms a tunnel around his reformed soul as Blaze hurtles through the darkness. Suddenly a colorful light appears growing rapidly. ""Ok that's new."" He says to himself.


Looking around he tries to stop himself  but is met with pure full body agony as he tries to resist. Being pulled through the source of of the light he fights against whatever is happening agony tearing at every fiber of his being as another barrier approaches ahead....



....


....


Looking up at the sky a  female knight in her early 30's looks up as a dim rainbow colored light flashes high above in space. She looks up to see a ball of energy appear from a long distant portal and streak across the sky impacting in a mountainous area. Looking after it she focuses on her illusion spell as a few corrupt knights ride by on horseback. 


""I'm probably not the only one who saw that."" She thinks to herself hurrying in it's direction....


....


...


Blaze looks up into the dark night sky from the bottom of a small crater. ""Seems like the new portals help a little with memory but I can't remember why I'm here, or before the last 500 years... Dam."" He thinks 


Looking up as a sword tip fills his view a knight in black armor stands over him. ""What say you of your crime violating the no magic and energy policy of the Dark One is punishable by death."" The knight says to Blaze. The knights armor making a strange glassy crinkle as he moves..


Blaze is taken aback. ""And what's the council think of that policy?"" He asks.


""Hahaha. The Dark One vanquished the council when he conquered this world. His law is the only law.""


Blaze tenses unsure if the knight is joking when he notices a burst of energy from behind the knight. Jumping back he dodges a bolt of purple lighting from another knight.


Sizing them up as he senses their energy he clenches his teeth. ""I'm not strong enough to beat them. I have to find Jane and the other.."" he starts to think as he lands suddenly running into a knight that got behind him.


Feeling the knight shift Blaze pushes off spinning as a sword cuts into his tunic.


Vaulting away he raises his energy and turns dashing away. Looking back he sees a knight raise his spear firing a bolt of energy at him.


Blaze leaps into the air and dodges the bolt of energy, feeling his body hum with the pain of a screech on a chalkboard as it passes by.


Flipping away a ball of energy passes close to Blaze's arm causing a painful tingling that causes his arm to collapse mid cartwheel. I a fraction of a second the knight moves  in on him, but he manages to spring up landing a swift kick to the gut, causing the knight to stumble backwards.


Charging a blast, Blaze's aura whips at the ground as he fires.  30 miles away people are knocked off their feet by the planetary blasts 30 megaton effect.


Residual sparks crackle around Blaze's fingers as the knight looks at  it's missing shoulder and left side of its chest. Blaze stares at the featureless obsidian insides of the knight in confusion.


It looks back at him unfazed as a glow eminates from the damaged edges and the missing areas slowly regenerate. 


Suddenly there's a blinding blue light and Blaze is hit with the disorienting full body feel of time stopping in the area.


Looking around he sighs in relief as he recognizes the time and teleportation  magic. As the purple and gold sphere forms around him he sits. ""Finally. I hope Ruby can explain what's going on here."" He thinks as his daughters magic whisks him away and the time spell wears off. The obsidian knight looks around in annoyance noticing the spell unable to hinder the escape....

Happy Holidays, fellow adventurers! ‘Tis the season of giving, and we wanted you to have some fun AI presents to play with over the holidays! We’re adding two new AI models for early access, Mixtral and MythoMax, into our lineup for AI Dungeon. Mixtral will be available for AI Dungeon Premium subscribers, and MythoMax will be available for both Premium subscribers and free players.

## About Mixtral and MythoMax

https://preview.redd.it/ssedvnfi3b7c1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef5321979b1e6cb555e793d5dd64ae6c76da91dc

**Mixtral** is the newest model available from Mistral AI, and we believe it has the potential to become the model of choice for most Premium players. Mixtral is a sparse mixture-of-experts network. It's an 8x7B model, coming in at 46.7B total parameters. Industry benchmarks rank Mixtral at or above models like Llama 70B or ChatGPT (GPT-3.5). Many of you have enjoyed using ChatGPT in AI Dungeon, and we think Mixtral will offer a similar quality of play experience without ChatGPT’s moralizing tendencies around common adventure themes of violence or romance.

https://preview.redd.it/jtuujzcj3b7c1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=d87fd13c9ac974c005f7f4ffe497261654c8307e

**MythoMax** is going to be the first new model we’ve added to our free tier in over two years! As many players know, using Large Language Models is expensive, and we feel fortunate we’ve been able to provide players with an unlimited free play option. And now the free offering will be even better. MythoMax is a Llama 2 13B (twice as large as the current Griffin model) and was specifically optimized for storytelling. We’re excited for you to try it and see how it compares!

As a callout, we want to thank the amazing open-source developers and creators responsible for sharing these models with the broader AI community. (If any of you want free AID subscriptions, let us know 😄)

## Launch Details

Both Mixtral and MythoMax will be launched into Production as “Early Access” models. We hope this label will communicate to players that we expect things to improve and change over the next month or two. We’re looking forward to your feedback, which will help us determine the optimizations needed to bring out the best of both models.

MythoMax will be available for both Free and Premium players. Context length will be determined by your tier.

* Free + Travelers (Steam users)—1k context length
* Adventurer—2k context length
* Hero—2k context length
* Legend—2k context length

Mixtral will be available for all Premium subscribers. Context length will also be determined by tier.

* Adventurer—2k context length
* Hero—4k context length
* Legend—4k context length, with 8k context length planned

Some of you may be aware that these models are technically capable of even larger context lengths, and our goal is to increase the context lengths offered for each model. However, larger context lengths can sometimes lead to a degraded AI experience, so we plan to do more testing and evaluation before expanding the context lengths.

## Our Next Chapter: AI Renaissance

The launch of Mixtral and MythoMax signals the start of the next Chapter for AI Dungeon.

With **Unchained**, we listened to player feedback and addressed limitations players were frustrated with. This included removing ads, improving stability, making image generation available to everyone, giving unlimited access to Premium models, and making several important AI improvements.

https://preview.redd.it/o68wl6dl3b7c1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=a0af6c07c63cc7d71fb8366fe930aed472f75f13

We’re currently wrapping up work on **Phoenix**, which represents a rebirth of AI Dungeon. Most noticeable was a complete overhaul of our UI/UX, making it more intuitive and engaging yet familiar for experienced players. Phoenix has significantly sped up how fast we can deliver new features to users and has also brought improved stability, device compatibility, and performance gains. We’ve also introduced new capabilities like Story Cards, theming, custom images, and more. It was a dramatic change, so Phoenix had a long Beta period where we gathered feedback from players and implemented improvements before making it the primary version of AI Dungeon.

https://preview.redd.it/007krwym3b7c1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=762b52fa4c25710af723dfae27ac40b9893e786a

Now, with the strong foundation built from Phoenix, we’re ready for our next chapter of AI Dungeon focused entirely on the AI experience. We’re calling it the “**AI Renaissance**”.

The Renaissance will feature new models (in addition to the ones announced today), improvements to model settings, increased stability and performance, more personalized model experiences, and more creative control over the AI. We’ll share more details about our plans after the New Year.

For those following the development of AI Dungeon Heroes, the work we’re doing for the AI Renaissance will lay the foundation for the launch of Heroes. We intend to use a variety of models (both current and future) to bring the Heroes experience to you. As Nick has mentioned in his Dev Logs, the planned launch features for Heroes are stabilizing. The next step is to take the existing AI game engine, which currently relies on larger models like GPT-4, and refine it down to smaller and cheaper models while preserving or improving accuracy.

## Happy Holidays!

Finally, we want to wish all of you a very happy holiday season. We hope all of you will be able to spend time with loved ones, take time away from the busyness of life, and make some meaningful memories.

Our team will be taking some time off for the holidays as well. Phoenix was a massive endeavor, and our team has been working long and hard all year. Most of the team will be taking well-deserved breaks.

Our community and support team will still be checking in to address urgent support issues, but we may not be as responsive as usual for all types of requests.

We’re looking forward to coming back for 2024 and making it the best year yet for AI

* Fixed an issue where desktop scrolling using arrow keys was impossible without clicking first
* Fixed an issue where Dragon J2 would allow a context length longer than 2048, which sometimes caused grammar issues
* Fixed an issue where chat models had the wrong parsing behavior in some cases
* Added a loading progress indicator for the initial app load on iOS and Android devices. If you get stuck on this screen, a screenshot of where it gets stuck will help us debug loading issues.

I recently signed up for the Premium, and the bot seems to be about the same. The memory sucks, and I'm constantly changing things. The ChatGPT AI honestly feels better and less repetitive, but the fact that it downgrades to Moderate makes me feel like I'll miss out on things.

I tried switching to Novel AI -- the interface on web mobile just isn't smooth, and after copying everything over it seems to be ""just as good"". I'll be sticking with AID for the convenience of the app.

My question is -- it seems like the majority of people are using these AI Dungeon adventures on a desktop environment. Is my frustration on both platforms only because I'm using the mobile versions?

I just discovered AI Dungeon 2 days ago, and I’m completely in love with the premise and promise this app has!

I’ve been exploring the “Phoenix” update, which as I understand is a significant UI/UX overhaul to bring AI Dungeon into a new era.

All in all, my experience with the app on iOS and via macOS Safari has been pretty incredible. The creative wanderlust is *real*, and this app does an amazing job facilitating that. It’s obvious a lot of thought has gone into the design, and that the backend is solid and primed for a really exciting roadmap. It’s also been very refreshing coming into all this — from the subreddit to the Discord, to the Guide, Dev Blogs and various other resources — and finding open communication from the development team. So kudos to Latitude for everything, and Happy Holidays from a new subscriber: y’all have created something truly magical to play with.

During my brief time using AI Dungeon in its “Phoenix” era, I've been having a blast but have also come up against some “oddities” in the UI/UX that I’d love to highlight for the devteam, since it seems they’re actively looking for feedback on things (which is great!).

Anyways, here we go!

—

\\#1

My first (and largest) overarching point is more of an overall design thing: the differences between Scenarios and Adventures was not immediately clear to me, and I’ve found that has led to other points of friction.

When I first opened AI Dungeon, I did what any new player will do and clicked the big green “Start” button to start my first Adventure. I chose Fantasy, etc and it wasn’t long before I wanted to start out another Adventure but one with my own custom setting.

I found that I could accomplish this by using the “Play” button at the bottom of the Home Screen, tapping “Create Scenario”, and choosing “Empty”.

I did not know what a “Scenario” was when I created it this way, and later when I was in my Adventure I discovered “Memory” and “Story Cards”, which I then poured a ton of time into so that I could best flesh out the world for my Adventure. While I was doing this, I was frustrated to find that there was no easy way to “restart” my adventure to play it over again using my new Memory/Card configurations, and instead had to tap the “delete” button over and over and over as I iterated things to restart my Adventure from the beginning.

This was going somewhat well (if tediously) until I realized that I was fundamentally off with everything I had been doing: I discovered that what I had done at the beginning was create a Scenario, after which AI Dungeon spun off an Adventure *from* that Scenario, and that all my Memory/Cards were attached to my Adventure and not the Scenario which was where I should have been putting them as that was technically the “base world” and the Adventure was just an “instance” of it. At the same time that this clicked for me, I noticed that the Scenario interface *did* have what effectively amounted to a “Start Fresh”(ie, “Restart”) button in its “Start” button, which would have been very helpful as I was iterating my world versus what I had been doing.

Suggestion: should Memories/Cards edited for an Adventure link back and apply to their originating Scenario (if you are the creator for both)? That would have been a much smoother introduction to the concept for me at least, as they are intrinsically linked in most every other way, and the UI is not very obvious with which you’re editing otherwise.

Suggestion: could a “Convert to Scenario” feature be introduced, for Adventures that have been developed with extensive Memories/Cards, that would convert them into a base Scenario version, just minus all of the actions?

—

\\#2

My Stuff should be more easily accessible. Right now, my custom Scenarios are hidden behind the “Avatar” button in the upper right, then behind “My Stuff/Profile”, then on into the “Scenarios” tab. It’s like they’re tucked away and hidden, while on the flip side my “Adventures” (ie, instances of my Scenarios) are readily available via the Home Page. This is a large part of why it took me so long to discover this key aspect of AI Dungeon’s design: til I went diving into the menus, I had no idea what a Scenario even was, let alone my Adventure’s relationship to it.

Suggestion: feature “My Scenarios” beneath “Recently Played” on the Home Screen?

—

\\#3

As I explored the menus, Guide, and this subreddit, I went searching for an easy way to “Restart” my Adventure to make iterating my Memory/Card configurations easier. (I now know that I should technically be editing Memories/Cards on my Scenario, and starting it fresh each time — but that also brings up a separate issue, where repeat Adventures start to litter the interface and clutter things up… I’ve just been tap-deleting each one, but maybe there could be an “Exit & Save Adventure” and “Exit & Don’t Save Adventure” option when leaving an Adventure to sidestep that?)

While I have seen no mention of such a “Restart” feature, I came across a lot of people mentioning an “Erase to Here” feature in the Legacy client, and after pondering why it would’ve been removed (or where it got moved to), I found Latitude’s article on it: [https://help.aidungeon.com/faq/what-is-erase-to-here](https://help.aidungeon.com/faq/what-is-erase-to-here)

Long story short, the feature was hidden into a command that is not readily discoverable and, to a new player, it seems that the expected behavior is to tap “Delete” over and over til you get back to the beginning of your story. (Little did I know that I should be *actually* be starting over fresh from my Scenario, but I digress 😋.) I now know that you can tap *anywhere* in the text, clear it, and type “/cleartohere” or “/cth”, and then press Enter and that will clear/erase to the selected area, but I still think that’s a bit obtuse in the grand design of things.

I did notice a Latitude post on this that they are experimenting with adding a button in for this behavior, which I think is great!, but I would also encourage diving deeper into the concept of “Restarting” as well as that’s the larger reason why I went looking to begin with. Despite that, I know that “Erase to Here” is essentially how a player can backtrack to a different fork in the road of their adventure and that that is its own justified use case as well (probably more than “Restart” if we’re being honest, but having both would be pretty nice).

While in an Adventure, changing the AI is kind of clunky: first, you must tap the Settings button in the upper-right, then tap Gameplay, then tap the AI dropdown and select your AI. I understand this might be a head scratcher (“why would you want to switch AIs often enough for this to matter?”), so let me explain:

I understand that the following is largely because the AIs the app is built around are, at times, temperamental… but sometimes it becomes necessary to switch between AIs during your adventures. For example, when the AI’s output is blank repeatedly or starts looping and it becomes necessary to switch to another AI, generate some output, and then switch back to the first AI to then retry the story... or maybe you just want to switch between different AI writing styles for a few paragraphs to see how the output might be different. For these case, tapping into the Settings, then Gameplay, then AI, making your selection and then back again back and forth feels like it could done a lot more easily.

Suggestion: perhaps there could be a “Quick Settings” button in the action button row, that simply renders a popover when tapped, where changing AIs or even their creativity parameters could be a one-two tap endeavor?

\\#5

It would be nice to have a Memory/Card Library, that would enable Cards or other descriptors like Memories to be easily copied/shared between Scenarios.

—

\\#6

It would be nice to have a “Word Count” label easily viewable on each Card, as well as clearly listed in the Memory interface, so that it becomes easier to identify which ones can be “pruned” to be made more dense/concise.

As I’ve learned how Memories and Cards work (specifically that Memories are always appended, and that Cards are appended upon reference, to the context that is sent to the AI), I’ve been making repeat attempts at condensing my Memories/Cards down to make sure as much of the story gets sent to the AI during each pass as possible, while retaining the amount of rich storytelling information the Memory/Cards feature allows access to.

This has essentially looked like this: I tap into the Memory interface, scan for what may or may not be “permanent” information to transmit to the AI and what can be stored into a Card, and then I tap back and forth between the Memory and Cards interfaces to copy/paste the text, before experimenting with the AIs output and iterating again.

As I’ve gone along, I’ve noticed that I’m leaning towards dense, concise cards and that every time I make another pass I find I can make it even more dense and concise.

Having easily viewable word counts on each Card would make ones that need to be “pruned” stand out more, in a “help the user help themselves” kind of way. Right now, I find I’m tapping into each Card, looking at its word count, thinking “eh, that’s prolly fine” and then going on to the next. But it’d be nice to not have to tap into the Card to see that information.

General UI suggestions:

* Scrolling in the main text view, particularly when tapping into an area to edit it, is often unpredictable. My text field often appears over the text I’ve tapped in to edit, and I have to scroll in a somewhat random fashion for the selected editable text area to appear “above” the keyboard. Editing text otherwise, particularly when adding text past the initial size of the editable text area, sometimes renders text “outside/beneath” the frame of the editable text area in such a way that it has to be backspaced to bring it up and appropriately orient itself in the editable text area.
* In the main text view, story output is separated nicely from Do/Say input with a nice graphic that denotes the separation. For Story/Continue actions, having paragraph separations being more prominent to separate things better visually would really help with readability.
* The interface feels “sluggish” throughout because it seems to be running at 30 or 60fps, I think because it is rendered as a webview and isn’t using OS-native interface controls? If there’s any way to allow AI Dungeon to refresh at the OS’s default refresh rate (ie, 120hz on my iPhone 14), it would make the whole experience *feel* a lot better. Right now, the menu transitions and app interactions are kind of jarring to look at.
* I’ve found the “Appearance” settings, but I’d really love just a simple “System” option that follows the Light/Dark mode of the OS. (Like how iBooks has a light mode and a dark mode to make text easier to read while in a bright room, or in direct sunlight.)
* This one's a bird-brained suggestion, but maybe a “Latest On Top” orientation for the main text view might sidestep some of the scrolling/text orientation issues? ie if the latest AI output/user input is always oriented to the top of the text stack instead of the end. Like an email/chat history where the latest messages are on top instead of on the bottom. I know that would also be *weird* for story readability, but if there were better Continue/Story/paragraph separations it probably wouldn't be too weird.

Editing text otherwise, particularly when adding text past the initial size of the editable text area, sometimes renders text “outside/beneath” the frame of the editable text area in such a way that it has to be backspaced to bring it up and appropriately orient itself in the editable text area.
* In the main text view, story output is separated nicely from Do/Say input with a nice graphic that denotes the separation. For Story/Continue actions, having paragraph separations being more prominent to separate things better visually would really help with readability.
* A “Latest On Top” orientation for the main text view might sidestep some of the scrolling/text orientation issues, ie if the latest AI output/user input is always oriented to the top of the text stack instead of the end.
* The interface feels “sluggish” throughout because it seems to be running at 30 or 60fps, I think because it is rendered as a webview and isn’t using OS-native interface controls? If there’s any way to allow AI Dungeon to refresh at the OS’s default refresh rate (ie, 120hz on my iPhone 14), it would make the whole experience \\*feel\\* a lot better. Right now, the menu transitions and app interactions are kind of jarring to look at.
* I’ve found the “Appearance” settings, but I’d really love just a simple “System” option that follows the Light/Dark mode of the OS. (Like how iBooks has a light mode and a dark mode to make text easier to read while in a bright room, or in direct sunlight.)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

&#x200B;

Once AI Dungeon switched to Phoenix, it changed the way the ""say"" action worked. It began to auto input a ""."" period at the end of your input. So whereas in Legacy Ai Dungeon it might've read, 'Where are you going?' my inputs now come out as 'Where are you going?.'

&#x200B;

This in and of itself is a relatively minor annoyance, but where it's really messed with me is my most used scenario. It had some scripting built in to the ""say"" action that required specific inputs ('n' and 'nd' specifically if that's relevant) but they are impossible to trigger now because Phoenix will always change my inputs to 'n.' and 'nd.'.

&#x200B;

Going back to my input and removing the period and pressing ""continue"" will not trigger the scripts unfortunately. This was for a 1-on-1 Instant Message style chat scenario that was created by another user who doesn't appear to be active anymore, so unfortunately I can't just go in myself and adjust the way the scripting works for the scenario.","True","False","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","44843","public","None","self","None","None","Phoenix changed ""Say"" action","None","0","[]","1703703050","4","0.84","https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/18rutdv/phoenix_changed_say_action/","[]","None","False","None","None","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
