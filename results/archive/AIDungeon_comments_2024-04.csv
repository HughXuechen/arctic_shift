### Styles Section Template for Scenes:

1. **Perspective**:
   - Start with the narrative perspective to immediately set the framework for how the scene is presented.

2. **Tone**:
   - Establishing the emotional undercurrent early helps to set the mood right from the beginning.

3. **Scene Setting**:
   - With the perspective and tone established, grounding the scene in its physical context comes next, providing a clear backdrop.

4. **Character Motivations and Dynamics**:
   - Early mention of characters’ motivations ensures that their behaviors and interactions are contextually grounded from the start.

5. **Writing Style**:
   - Clarifying the overall style early on helps guide the descriptive and dialogue elements according to the scene's requirements.

6. **Scene Dynamics**:
   - Detailing the interaction dynamics and action sequences sets the stage for the scene's unfolding.

7. **Narrative Focus**:
   - Highlighting specific narrative elements or themes to focus on ensures that the scene stays aligned with the overarching story goals.

8. **Environmental Details**:
   - Integrating sensory and environmental details enriches the scene's atmosphere and immersion.

9. **Unknown Elements/Behind the Scenes**:
   - Placing hints or foreshadowing here using brackets okay let's try this maintains narrative intrigue and depth, subtly guiding the storyline.

10. **Stay in the Moment/Scene Constraints**:
    - Ending with a reminder to focus on the present scene helps keep the AI’s generation targeted and prevents it from veering off into unrelated narrative paths.

11. Incorporate character backgrounds and world-building details from the lore book to enrich dialogue and scene descriptions.

Ensure character behaviors and world elements remain consistent with descriptions in the lore book

EXAMPLE OF A COMPLEX SCENE
------------------------
For the next scene set in a poker room, let's fill in the details to create a vivid, immersive poker game environment, focusing on character interactions and the setting. This is an overcomplicated scene because it's a poker game with several players.

---

**Perspective:** Limited third-person, focusing on Tony's experiences and interactions.

**Tone:** Sarcastic, reflecting the sharp wit and street smarts of the players.

**Writing Style:** Street Smart, capturing the savvy and cunning inherent in seasoned poker players.

**Scene Setting:** A dimly lit poker room, creating an atmosphere of intense focus and subtle strategies.

**Time of Day:** Noon, an unusual time for such a gathering, adding an element of secrecy or exclusivity to the game.

**Scene Dynamics:** Tony is seated at a table with four other seasoned poker players, each with their own unique style and strategy, engaged in a tense game of Texas hold'em.

**Narrative Focus:** The scene primarily revolves around the gameplay, with attention to the psychological battle and strategy among the players.

**Environmental Details:** The room is smokey, filled with the lingering scent of cigars and anticipation. The sound of shuffled cards and quiet conversations adds to the ambiance, creating a cocoon of concentration away from the outside world.

**Location:** Miami Beach, inside a poker room known for hosting high-stakes games.

**Characters:**

- **Tony:** Confident, sharp, and intuitive, Tony plays with a mix of calculated risk and bold bluffs.
- **Poker Player 1: ""Eddie 'The Shark' Malone""** - A veteran player known for his aggressive tactics and ability to read others.
- **""Poker Player 2: ""Lena 'Quick Fingers' Russo""** - The only female at the table, renowned for her fast play and unpredictable strategies.
- **Poker Player 3:""Joey 'Two Times' DiMarco""** - So named for his habit of always asking for a card count twice, a meticulous player with a knack for long-haul games.
- **Poker Player 4: ""Vic 'The Slick' Rodriguez""** - A smooth talker with a penchant for psychological warfare, always playing the players as much as the cards.
- **Waitress: ""Gina""** - Attentive and unobtrusive, Gina knows the players' usual orders and moves through the room like a ghost, her presence barely noticed yet always appreciated.
- **Dealer: ""Big Mike""** - A fixture in the poker room, Big Mike deals with a steady hand and an unfazed demeanor, accustomed to the high tension of the games he oversees.

**Unknown Elements/Behind the Scenes:** [The unspoken tension of alliances and rivalries among the players adds an undercurrent of drama to the game. Each player harbors their own motives and secrets, from personal vendettas to hidden strategies.]

**Stay in the Moment/Scene Constraints:** The scene remains tightly focused on the ongoing game, avoiding time jumps or shifts in setting. The detailed play-by-play of the poker game, alongside the banter and psychological interplay among the characters, drives the narrative, enriching the scene with layers of character development and tension.",kxh7c1u,t3_1bsntgw,t1_kxh7c1u,t1_kxh6u8y,/r/AIDungeon/comments/1bsntgw/any_way_to_slow_scenes_down/kxh7c1u/,2,2,,1712061662,[],,,False,,,,[],,,,text,False,False,False,[],,,False,False,False,,,,,0,1711932052,1711932052,,0,False,0,False,,False,,,,[],True,,,,,1711932066,False,False,True,False,AIDungeon,t5_29uaei,r/AIDungeon,public,,0,[],,[]

20240403-225131,cerisesymphonie,t2_12wvq8,"All right! Just to be sure we're on the same page, I'm running this scenario as a free user and I tested this on MythoMax. I can try this with other models but here's what I think the issue is.

So, before the update, Story Cards were triggered by the *most recent* triggered keyword. And if the entirety of the Story Card didn't fit in, no problem. It'll stuff in whatever does fit and cut off the rest.

After the update...don't ask me what exactly it chooses to trigger but as long as several trigger words are in the context window (which you can see via Gameplay > Testing & Feedback > Inspect Input), as far as I'm aware of, it'll choose random Story Card(s) to trigger. And if the *whole* Story Card does not fit, it won't even try to load it.

Now, this scenario has two identical Story Cards for the Hollows. I assume this is a mistake, but just by triggering Hollow, it'll bring up both Story Cards and take up 1196 characters. What 1196 characters translates to for context tokens, I don't know exactly. I just know that 1196 characters means that no other Story Cards can trigger because there's not enough room for them while Hollow is an active keyword trigger.

And if you Memory and Author's Note added with lots of stuff in them, you'll have even less room and as soon as the AI determines that the Story Card does not fit, it won't load it.

Of course, you don't have to trigger Hollow but you're going to run into the same issue as you keep playing. Let's say you trigger Hueco Mundo and Shinigami at the same time. Bam. That's 866 characters filling up the context window. Okay, if you have nothing/barely anything in your Memory, you might be able to fit in one extra Story Card - maybe Quincy.

But while Hueco Mundo, Shinigami and Quincy are in the context window, no other Story Card is going to load. Even if you're done talking about Hueco Mundo, Shinigami and Quincy, their Story Cards remain active and you can't load the more relevant Story Card(s) until those three leave the context window.

20240403-230845,International-Ask388,t2_vmnf2yos," Speaking of dreams, i wanna share this fragment from the story.

Sleep soon takes over, and you drift off into a peaceful slumber. As you sleep, you dream that you're walking through the meadow, the grass soft beneath your feet. The sun shines down on you, warm and inviting. You feel a sense of peace and contentment wash over you. Suddenly, you hear the sound of footsteps behind you.

As you turn around, you see nothing. You strain your eyes, scanning the horizon, but there's nothing there.

Suddenly you see a cloud that drop wooden barrels and it moves towards you. The cloud of wooden barrels approaches quickly, and you have only a moment to react. The barrels tumble and crash around you, releasing a swarm of books and papers that scatter in the wind. The wind picks up, and a gust blows through the meadow, carrying with it the smell of old parchment and dust.

You take off running, weaving between the falling barrels and dodging the flying books. The wind howls around you, whipping your hair into your face and making it difficult to see. But you push on, determined to escape the strange cloud.

As you run you notice that meadow slowly turns into a surface of the moon and you find yourself in the low gravity. You leap into the air, weightless and free as you soar over the lunar surface. The cloud of barrels and books dissipates, leaving only the silence and stillness of the moon behind.

You see the Earth in the distance, a bright blue marble suspended in the inky blackness of space. Suddenly trains appear out of nowhere and start to move in random directions. The trains seem to be made of some sort of glowing energy, and they move with a grace and speed that is both mesmerizing and slightly disorienting.

You feel a strange pull towards them, as if they are calling out to you. But suddenly you are underwater and the tranquil scene of the moon is replaced by the crushing weight of the ocean above you.

The water is dark and cold, and you can feel the pressure building up around you. You struggle to swim to the surface, but it feels impossibly far away. You see dark female figure sitting in chair near table. She holds a cup in her hand. The figure's face is obscured by the shadows, but she seems to be watching you intently. Her long hair flows around her like a dark cloud. You can't make out any details of her face, but you can feel her gaze on you. Suddenly water disappears.

You stand on the bottom of the waterless ocean. Strange dark female figure invites you to come closer with gesture. As you approach the figure, you notice that she is surrounded by a soft, shimmering glow. She gestures for you to sit down across from her, and you comply, taking a seat in the chair she has provided. The figure regards you with a calm, appraising gaze, her eyes glinting with a faint hint of amusement. 

Figure says ""Take some tea. Don't be shy"" You cautiously reach out and take the cup of tea that the figure offers you. It feels warm and comforting in your hands, and as you bring it to your lips, you notice that it has a rich, earthy flavor. You take a sip, savoring the taste, and feel a sense of calm and peace wash over you. 

Figure says ""You know why are you here?""

You say ""Umm.. No.. Where am i?"" 

Figure says ""On the bottom of the atlantic ocean""

You say ""Okay.. But why?"" 

The figure chuckles softly. ""No-no, that's me who's asking""

You say ""But.. I don't know the answer."" 

Figure says ""I know the answer"" 

You stare at the figure, confused. ""Then why are you asking me?"" you say finally. 

The figure takes another sip of her tea before setting it down on the table. ""I asked you this just for no reason. This is actually the same reason why you are here. It's that simple \*chuckles\*""

Suddenly you feel that you are floating and after a few moments you fly away with a great speed. ""Wha-?"" you exclaim, momentarily disoriented as you're suddenly sent flying away at an incredible speed. The wind rushes past you, whipping your hair back as you hurtle through the darkness. You try to regain your bearings, but the only thing you can see is the distant glow of something that you fly towards.

You take control of your flight, weaving through the darkness at incredible speeds. The glow you've been flying towards grows brighter and brighter, until finally you realize where are you. You are in the cyberspace. In the internet itself. You see how messages, videos, pictures and other data flow around you like a stream of colorful energy. You feel a strange sense of connection to everything here, as if this is where you truly belong.

You see a massive server farm laid out before you, filled with glowing towers and humming machinery. You see cats. A lot of cats. They begin to appear out of nowhere, rapidly.

After a few moments there is so many of them, that they are everywhere now. As the cats swirl around you, you can't help but laugh in delight. You've always had a soft spot for cats, and seeing them here in this strange, digital world feels almost surreal. You reach out to pet one, and it purrs contentedly in response. But they can't stop to appear and now there is too many of them. The cats continue to materialize around you, their numbers growing to an overwhelming degree.

You struggle to maintain your balance as they bump against your legs and jump into your lap, their purring becoming a low roar that fills your ears. 

There is so many of them appeared that you now flooded with them. You begin to drown in cats and their fur. As you're buried deeper and deeper in the sea of cats, you start to feel a sense of panic setting in. You struggle to break free, but there are just too many of them. You gasp for air, but all you can breathe in is soft fur and the sounds of the contented purrings.

Suddenly you wake up and jump out from the bed.",kxxj4mt,t3_1bv405f,t1_kxxj4mt,t1_kxxcqiu,/r/AIDungeon/comments/1bv405f/huh/kxxj4mt/,8,8,,,1712315331,,[],,,False,,,,[],,,,text,False,False,False,[],,,False,False,False,,,,,0,1712185725,1712185725,,0,False,0,True,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],True,,,,,1712185741,False,False,True,False,AIDungeon,t5_29uaei,r/AIDungeon,public,,0,[],,[]

That's basically it. Of course, compared to before, doing Step 2 is a total hassle. You're basically doing the original Story Card system manually/by hand.

For the Bleach scenario, if you barely have anything in Memory, I think you could probably get away with pasting several commonly used Story Cards into Memory. And then, whenever you mention a less commonly used one, you just paste that baby into Memory, possibly replacing one of the others temporarily.

Heroes so far has proven to be *extremely tolerant* of mature subjects, up to and including spicy NSFW scenes. I’m not really sure *why* it’s been so permissive, but the model seems to understand it’s being used for roleplaying purposes and allows more morally questionable content than it otherwise would.

Some users of GPT-4 Turbo absolutely *rave* about its performance in traditional AID. The model is indeed remarkably good at remembering and accounting for special circumstances like centaurs not being to use regular chairs and mermaids not being able to move on land without a wheelchair or equivalent. It’s true that 1 credit per 250 tokens is pricey (and you’ll not likely *want* to pay for the max of 128k tokens), but a 4–8k context is reasonable at 16–32 credits, which works out to about $0.10–0.20 per action.",ky7jsmz,t3_1bwmb6p,t1_ky7jsmz,t3_1bwmb6p,/r/AIDungeon/comments/1bwmb6p/gpt_turbo_useful/ky7jsmz/,5,5,,,1712473618,,[],,,False,,#937bb1,,[],c527ac74-cb9a-11ee-bc68-2a47f4932cc5,Community Helper,light,text,False,False,False,[],,,False,False,False,,,,,0,1712341933,1712341933,,0,False,0,False,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],False,,,,,1712341948,False,False,True,False,AIDungeon,t5_29uaei,r/AIDungeon,public,,0,[],,[]
20240405-205411,ExclusiveAnd,t2_mpimrknc,"There is a specific prioritization, but it's fairly complicated. My understanding of it is as follows:

1. Only up to 50% of your context may be used by things other than your story. This constraint even applies when your entire story is smaller than its 50% share, and this behavior can result in some of your context being left unused even if more story cards, etc., could have been loaded.
2. Non-story context is prioritized: AI Instructions, then Memory, then Author's Note, then story cards, but content size can affect which of these are kept or dropped.
  * AI Instructions are a formerly hidden bit of context that may become editable in the near future. They establish, for example, that the model should act like a DM and not a chatbot.
  * If you're a script user, front memory figures into the above somewhere as well.
3. The Author's Note is a bit finicky about where it can be inserted. I *believe* it's added 3 newlines back from the end of your story, which (depending on your writing style) might be long ways back!
  * AI Dungeon can end up in a state where it decides AN can't fit after accounting for the output buffer (75 tokens by default), AI Instructions (157 tokens), Memory, and the last three paragraphs of your story, but then it *can* fit a few story cards in before hitting the allotted 50%. This would make it look like story cards are being prioritized over AN, but in reality it's an issue with the size of your paragraphs.
4. Which story cards get included seems to be arbitrary. They're *not* prioritized by which ones are triggered most recently, but instead seem to favor adding smaller cards in lieu of larger ones.
  * I suspect the actual algorithm is something like: Choose a triggered card at random. Does it fit? If so, add it and repeat. Otherwise, drop it and repeat. Accordingly, smaller cards can be added even after larger cards are dropped, and thus smaller cards have a slightly better chance of being included when context is tight.
  * AI Dungeon won't add a partial story card; it's either all or nothing.
5. Lastly, after all of your non-story context has been decided, all remaining space is filled with your story. If your non-story context was made up of big chunks and did not exactly fit into its allotted 50%, this can result in an apparent *huge* amount of your story being favored over non-story context.
  * For example, if each of your Memory, Author Note, and story cards are 26% of your total context, AI Dungeon can only fit one of these, leaving 74% of your total context for story!",ky88sq6,t3_1bwknq5,t1_ky88sq6,t3_1bwknq5,/r/AIDungeon/comments/1bwknq5/context_prioritization/ky88sq6/,2,2,True,,1712480061,,[],,,False,,#937bb1,,[],c527ac74-cb9a-11ee-bc68-2a47f4932cc5,Community Helper,light,text,False,False,False,[],,,False,False,False,,,,,0,1712350451,1712350451,,0,False,0,False,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],True,,,,,1712350467,False,False,True,False,AIDungeon,t5_29uaei,r/AIDungeon,public,,0,[],,[]

20240406-224915,Automatic_Apricot634,t2_su6a5vehs,"Compared to what? The free tier? Yes. Some other options? It depends.

The first thing you need to do is learn how to summarize the key details of the story you don't want AI forgetting in the Memory section. This will let you get past the initial ""dementia"" problem. AFTER that, you will still notice that 1K context length doesn't go very far. 1K is only about 2-3 pages. If you want a long and involved story with lots of details, even summarized memory will grow bigger than that. THEN you can decide whether the cost of subscription is worth being able to have a bigger story like that.

The other thing you should know is that with a decent gaming computer you can run AI yourself locally. The models like Mythomax and Tiefighter are available for free, and so is the software to run them, like KoboldCPP. If you just want bigger context, this is a free way to get that. If you can't afford AID, definitely look into this. Even with a crappy computer, you can probably do a 7B-range model similar to Griffin.

Finally, it's not just about context length. AID subscription gets you a bigger and better AI, Mixtral. Unless you have very serious hardware, running Mixtral locally is probably out of reach locally. The hardware to enable that would cost a lot, making AID an attractive option.

So the answer to your question depends on what you value and what hardware you have access to. A decently modern gaming machine and you're happy with Tiefighter, but want bigger context, then just run it yourself for free. A potato computer (or just a phone) and/or you really want the best and smartest AI possible, then buy AID.",kye0pau,t3_1bxefmz,t1_kye0pau,t3_1bxefmz,/r/AIDungeon/comments/1bxefmz/does_the_subscriptions_really_worth_it/kye0pau/,6,6,True,,1712573366,,[],,,False,,#937bb1,,[],c527ac74-cb9a-11ee-bc68-2a47f4932cc5,Community Helper,light,text,False,False,False,[],,,False,False,False,,,,,0,1712443755,1712443755,,0,False,0,False,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],True,,,,,1712443774,False,False,True,False,AIDungeon,t5_29uaei,r/AIDungeon,public,,0,[],,[]

Oh and dont forget Mixtral constantly trying to emotionally gaslight you if god knows, you do what you want in Ai Dungeon.

20240407-213558,ExclusiveAnd,t2_mpimrknc,"u/Automatic_Apricot634 is right, but might I ask what character information you have? It’s important to present the right details and phase it in the right way for the AI to understand.

My list of recommendations are:

* Format everything in one paragraph per character. Repeat the character’s name (specifically, how *you* want the story to refer to them) at least every other sentence (i.e., limit your use of “he” and “she”, but do use it *some* so the AI knows their gender).
* Beyond name, gender, race, and class/job, focus on personality, relationships, and emotional responses. The AI pays the most attention to these and will do the most with them.
* Some physical description is OK if it’s extremely relevant, e.g., they’re so short people sometimes don’t notice them or their hair is so big it gets in the way of things (and you should phrase detail in terms of the effects they have). Otherwise, the AI is likely to just ignore things and push your character toward Generic Fantasy/Sci-Fi/Anime Person dimensions.
* Too much physical description can sent the AI down curious roads. Stories have a lot of description when people are first introduced and when things are about to get spicy, so heavy description (which, to the AI, looks like it happened recently in your story) might lead the AI to constantly reintroduce characters or to… have them do certain other things.
* Be careful with backstories! The AI will usually think they *just* happened, but you can mitigate this in two ways: first, you can describe how you’re characters *feel* about past events, such as “Bob feels depressed about the death of his brother”, and second, you can describe how things are NOW *first* with a comparison how they used to be, such as “Bob is an old man now, but he was in the army when he was younger.”
* You should strive to be as brief as possible. This both leaves you more room for story context, leading to more coherent stories, and makes the AI’s input look more like a story than an encyclopedic description of your characters. The AI mimics what it sees, so too much of the later is just going to produce *more* descriptions, sometimes copied directly from what you gave it.",kyj1v8b,t3_1by2t9x,t1_kyj1v8b,t3_1by2t9x,/r/AIDungeon/comments/1by2t9x/can_you_please_help_me_understand_how_to_add_a/kyj1v8b/,4,4,True,,1712655365,,[],,,False,,#937bb1,,[],c527ac74-cb9a-11ee-bc68-2a47f4932cc5,Community Helper,light,text,False,False,False,[],,,False,False,False,,,,,0,1712525758,1712525758,,0,False,0,False,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],True,,,,,1712525772,False,False,True,False,AIDungeon,t5_29uaei,r/AIDungeon,public,,0,[],,[]

20240408-122025,ExclusiveAnd,t2_mpimrknc,"I don’t know for certain, but my best theory on the matter is two fold:

First, image analysis is harder than text analysis, so it’s harder to develop an accurate image filter than text filter. Images can vary quite a lot more than text (“a picture is worth a thousand words,” etc.), which means there’s more SFW images that are close to NSFW and vice verse (consider especially an otherwise SFW image with something explicit hidden in some corner of the background). Accordingly, image filters have a much harder task, and they err on the side of safety because…

Second, there may actually be legal reasons to exclude NSFW image content. AI Dungeon is available in dozens of countries, each of which has its own idea about how much responsibility Latitude needs to take in preventing, e.g., children from accessing obscene material. While written word can certainly cross the line (and the [community guidelines](https://help.aidungeon.com/faq/what-are-your-community-guidelines) indeed establish where that line is), images are far easier to observe at a glance and are thus subject to more pointed litigation.

Being as how the technology for IF games is almost as old as video games themselves, it's easy to understand how one would assume this new tech (AI) would automatically be able to do everything IF games could by default. When in truth, they both do very different things. With one being very rigid and rules based and the other being much more creative and unrestrictive. In this case, too unrestrictive.

Of course in the end and ideally, we want to merge what we used to do, with what we're doing now, as it's the only feasible way to have a structured world and combat the problem of combinatorial explosion at the same time. The only other way to really do that previously, was to omit much of the story structure in an IF, or sometimes have no meaningful choices at all, making it closer to a stat based rpg than your common text adventure.

20240412-113924,ExclusiveAnd,t2_mpimrknc,"This looks like the first AI response after Character Creation. What’s going on, of course, is that Character Creator often generates its initial description in 3rd person, but I’m not sure why it’s so prone to do so. My guess is that there is insufficient context being passed to the AI to establish second person as the intended style *during* Character Creation, but then the AI switches back to second person afterwards because it knows it’s supposed to be telling a story then.

The generated character description paragraph is handled specially and it’s not at all clear what the context and/or AI model settings and instructions actually are, but I’m guessing Latitude could do to beef up the emphasis on writing it in the intended person (second or third, according to whether the scenario has the “Third Person” Plot Element).

In the meantime, authors can end their Character Creator prompts with a sentence to the effect of “Your description is as follows:”, which *might* help the AI realize off of what comes after pertains to *you*.

Some people complain it's not letting them do what they want, some people complain AI lets them get away with anything they want. 

IMO, AI is not a very good DM. I see it as a writing partner instead. It can make a mistake, which I can then correct.

That's why I don't like ""Adventure mode"" with the whole ""do/say/whatever"". When you are in story mode, what you write becomes part of the story and it's a lot harder for the AI to contradict that. Even if it does, you can guide it in the right direction with partial sentences. Like:

>blue tint to his uniform.

>You shake your head, looking at him with regret and raise your gun.

>""Forgive me,"" you say to Jeremy as you fire, putting him out of his misery.

So, I'd say the propensity to save you is probably something it learned from all those adventure stories it was trained on, where the protagonist survives the odds.

Also, I thought it turned out pretty funny, so, enjoy. :) 

>You are standing atop a narrow ledge overlooking a vast chasm that stretches for miles. The only thing separating you from certain doom is a precariously balanced rock, which serves as your makeshift bridge. The wind howls around you, and the ground beneath your feet seems to tremble with each gust. You can see the flicker of campfire light far off in the distance, a beacon of safety and warmth that feels like it's mocking you.  
  
**Suddenly, a dragon appears from behind a cliff. It sees you and, with a deafening roar, charges in your direction. It's definitely not friendly.**  
  
**You decide the best course of action in this situation is to start dancing the Gangnam Style dance, right on the slippery ledge. As you perform your moves, the dragon approaches and stares at you, seemingly baffled by your actions.**  
  
But as the dragon gets closer, you realize that the ledge is more unstable than you thought. You feel it begin to crumble beneath your feet. Panic sets in as you try to maintain your balance while continuing to dance, hoping it will distract the creature long enough for you to escape.  
  
**In your brilliance, you start solemnly reciting the lyrics to Oops I Did It Again by Britney Spears, thinking it will help you stay on the ledge.**  
  
Oops... you did it again,  
Took my breath away,  
Oops... you think you got it,  
Right there,  
That look was priceless,  
Oh, oh, oh,  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...  
  
The dragon pauses for a moment, equally confused by your dance and your song choice. Taking advantage of its temporary perplexion, you make a daring leap and grab onto a nearby vine hanging over the chasm. You swing out just as the ledge gives way, narrowly avoiding the jaws of the beast below.  
  
As you cling to the vine, you see the dragon cock its head to one side, clearly confused by your display. The absurdity of the situation is not lost on you, and you can't help but let out a nervous laugh. This seems to annoy the dragon, and with another roar, it lunges at you.  
  
But thanks to your quick reflexes and surprising agility from dancing on the ledge, you manage to swing further out of reach. Using this momentum, you notice a narrow pathway on the cliff face leading back to safety. With hope renewed, you begin to climb.",kz9powx,t3_1c29ltf,t1_kz9powx,t1_kz9n2e8,/r/AIDungeon/comments/1c29ltf/oh_you_gotta_be_fucking_kidding_me_mixtral_slander/kz9powx/,1,1,True,,1713075323,,[],,,False,,#937bb1,,[],c527ac74-cb9a-11ee-bc68-2a47f4932cc5,Community Helper,light,text,False,False,False,[],,,False,False,False,,,,,0,1712945717,1712945717,,0,False,0,False,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],True,,,,,1712945733,False,False,True,False,AIDungeon,t5_29uaei,r/AIDungeon,public,,0,[],,[]

From what I gather the problem is between AI Dungeon and the model’s host/provider, and I’m not sure who that might be. I still suspect it’s a tokenization issue, but I can’t claim to understand what’s actually wrong. One thing I’ll observe, though: it’s good the provider is returning an error for this issue as opposed to dropping a few tokens at one end or another. AI Dungeon’s context is very delicately crafted and arbitrarily cutting out even a few tokens would either eat up one’s Memory or one’s recent story actions, and either option would make the model look worse when it’s really an input issue.

I am not sure if there was a miscommunication at Latitude, but that is so scummy, if it am right, which I hope I am wrong.

 If you go to ""See complete details"" and press the ""Story generators"" you get shown two different awnsers for Legen and Mythic, which makes sense. However Legend states ""250 tokens per credit"", while Mythic states, ""1k free, up to 128k"".

Your approach using ""`## plot: X offers you to join B`"" in a Story action will certainly load the appropriate SC because, to the UI, your command looks like a continuation of your story (even though the AI handles it specially). Using ""`## instruct commands`"" is the way to go when you want the AI to do something very specific (and you want it to have the maximum information about what its doing), but it's annoying to have to go edit them out afterwards.

(Aside: it's actually OK to leave ""`## instruct commands`"" in place after you're done with them, but I recommend editing them out because, even though they won't confuse the AI, they'll still eat up a few of your tokens, thereby shortening the amount of story the AI can consider.)",kzv6cub,t3_1c4trz9,t1_kzv6cub,t1_kzuwtaz,/r/AIDungeon/comments/1c4trz9/factions/kzv6cub/,1,1,,,1713420941,,[],,,False,,#937bb1,,[],c527ac74-cb9a-11ee-bc68-2a47f4932cc5,Community Helper,light,text,False,False,False,[],,,False,False,False,,,,,0,1713291334,1713291334,,0,False,0,False,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],True,,,,,1713291350,False,False,True,False,AIDungeon,t5_29uaei,r/AIDungeon,public,,0,[],,[]

However its important to keep in mind how niche this is. There are thousands of AI companies that have their own niche, it does not mean they are nescarily doing the best they could. Its just there is a lack of competition.

  
I am not saying AIDungoen is not a good product, it really is. I am saying you should not value it based on its competition. Because It would not have one whether it was good or bad.

  
When Llama 3 comes out (and eventually chat gpt 5), that will change the story, it will be much better than pretty much every AI on the market. If they cant adopt Llama 3, it would be very detrimental in competition to others that do in my opinion.

I've certainly conducted scenes featuring 4 and even 5 characters on Mixtral and it only got confused when character identifiers were too vague, e.g., ""the burly henchman"" vs ""the henchman with a dagger"", who were not the same.

* MythoMax and Tiefighter are better about personalities, so if you're focused on dialog and character development, they can beat out the premium models. I don't know if they can handle *4* characters at once—I haven't put them to the test—but they're usually good to keep character traits separate from one another. Where I've heard them struggle, however, is when characters should have varying personalities depending on who they're interacting with; the AI will tend to give them the same personality with everyone all the time.

* Griffin and Dragon are not great choices. Griffin in particular is quite prone to mix up character traits, who's talking in dialog, and will even reintroduce new characters that are clones of your existing characters.",l00yc4j,t3_1c5poma,t1_l00yc4j,t3_1c5poma,/r/AIDungeon/comments/1c5poma/multiple_characters/l00yc4j/,1,1,,,1713508848,,[],,,False,,#937bb1,,[],c527ac74-cb9a-11ee-bc68-2a47f4932cc5,Community Helper,light,text,False,False,False,[],,,False,False,False,,,,,0,1713379235,1713379235,,0,False,0,False,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],True,,,,,1713379248,False,False,True,False,AIDungeon,t5_29uaei,r/AIDungeon,public,,0,[],,[]

20240417-185748,ExclusiveAnd,t2_mpimrknc,"As for how to express the details for multiple characters to the AI, my recommendation is as follows:

* Story cards for each character. The trigger should be the most common means you (and the AI) use to refer to the characters, so usually their first name. Two caveats:

    * If the characters are literally *always there, you might as well just put their information in Memory. That way, (a) it can't be bumped out by other story cards and (b) you *know* it's always in context. It's easier to edit that way, too.

    * If one of your characters has a name that might be part of other words, you should put spaces around their name. For example, a character named ""Lea"" would be triggered by the word ""please"", but not if ""Lea"" is listed with a space in front or behind.

* The general format I recommend is: `FULL_NAME is a GENDER RACE CLASS with PHYSICAL_TRAIT. NAME is PERSONALITY and PERSONALITY. NAME is RELATIONSHIP_TO_OTHER CHARACTERS. NAME feels EMOTION about PAST_EVENT.` (Replacing capitalized terms with appropriate fill-ins, of course.)

    * You can skip or expand sections as desired and add any details about special abilities, etc., but try to stay under 300 characters.

    * Keep in mind the AI pays more attention to character personalities, relationships, and emotions than it does to their physical traits, possessions, and places they frequent.

    * This also uses a trick to introduce PAST_EVENT in terms of the character's emotions or opinions, which helps prevent the AI from thinking PAST_EVENT just happened.",l011hiw,t3_1c5poma,t1_l011hiw,t1_l00yc4j,/r/AIDungeon/comments/1c5poma/multiple_characters/l011hiw/,1,1,True,,1713509880,,[],,,False,,#937bb1,,[],c527ac74-cb9a-11ee-bc68-2a47f4932cc5,Community Helper,light,text,False,False,False,[],,,False,False,False,,,,,0,1713380268,1713380268,,0,False,0,False,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],False,,,,,1713380281,False,False,True,False,AIDungeon,t5_29uaei,r/AIDungeon,public,,0,[],,[]

20240418-004656,cerisesymphonie,t2_12wvq8,"Well, back during the old Story Card system...it would trigger the most recent Story Card whenever its trigger keyword popped up. So by doing that, I could have the AI read one card at a time and have it give me great outputs.

Like, say I'm talking to a character - it can read his/her Story Card so it gets his/her personality. Then let's say my character mentions a certain Magical Item with a Story Card. It'll now read that Story Card instead of the character's, but since the AI sees what the character is acting like in the Context Window, it should still be able to keep him/her in-character while also understanding this Magical Item. Then in the next action, I can just trigger the character's Story Card again and make sure it hones in on the character's personality once more (and it won't load up the Magical Item Story Card anymore now that it's no longer needed so you have more space again!). And I can usually fit quite a lot into the Story Card - perhaps around 800-850 characters if I have a lot of stuff in Memory.

Of course, that's all thrown out the window with the new Story Card system! And in that case, you'd be absolutely right. Under the new Story Card system, there's kinda no point in having (lengthier) Story Cards for a free user. I mean, I guess it's useful if you only want it to load up your (short) Story Card(s) periodically and then kick them out of the Context Window when they're not being mentioned. But for anything longer? I literally have to copy and paste Story Cards into Memory if I want them to show up correctly/at the right time.

But I love how you put it. If they ever have another survey, asking players what they think about how things are going, that so needs to be mentioned so they can hopefully see that they need include an option for the old Story Card system or just add some changes to make it more convenient again!",l02q2cu,t3_1b3oa8k,t1_l02q2cu,t1_l02n436,/r/AIDungeon/comments/1b3oa8k/what_can_i_do_with_the_lack_of_tokens_as_player/l02q2cu/,2,2,True,,1713530829,,[],,,False,,,,[],,,,text,False,False,False,[],,,False,False,False,,,,,0,1713401216,1713401216,,0,False,0,False,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],True,,,,,1713401231,False,False,True,False,AIDungeon,t5_29uaei,r/AIDungeon,public,,0,[],,[]

20240418-124018,ExclusiveAnd,t2_mpimrknc,"Given that you have a large context length, it's probably fine for these story cards to have overlapping triggers and for them to be intended to be in context essentially all the time. As such, you're using them as extended Memory, but that's OK.

Some things to watch out for:

* Don't give them all *exactly the same list of triggers*. This can cause problems if you Export and later re-Import them (specifically, cards with *identical* trigger lists may be deleted). I'd recommend going with ""`Demeter,interior`"", ""`Demeter,exterior`"", and ""`Demeter,weapons,shields`"" or something similar.

* Bear in mind that if you *don't* keep mentioning ""Demeter"" by name somewhere in the most recent 3 actions, the AI will not keep these story cards loaded all the time. As a result, it may intermittently seem to forget what it's talking about. To remedy this, you can put more of the most relevant information into Memory or you can use an *even more common* trigger for the cards. (It's a bit of a bug, but adding a trailing ""`,`"" to the trigger list will cause the card to match *always*.)

* Despite your 4k of context, if you still run out of available tokens, the AI will arbitrarily drop story cards until it can fit what's left. This may happen when you have lots of other story cards triggering as well, and the result will again be like the AI suddenly forgetting important details in the middle of a story. To fix this, you either need to make sure that your (other) story cards are very short and triggered exactly when needed, or you again need to move as many details as you can into Memory, which can't be dropped.",l04vr8g,t3_1c6k4dl,t1_l04vr8g,t3_1c6k4dl,/r/AIDungeon/comments/1c6k4dl/multiple_scs_for_the_same_locationcharacter/l04vr8g/,1,1,True,,1713573631,,[],,,False,,#937bb1,,[],c527ac74-cb9a-11ee-bc68-2a47f4932cc5,Community Helper,light,text,False,False,False,[],,,False,False,False,,,,,0,1713444018,1713444018,,0,False,0,False,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],True,,,,,1713444033,False,False,True,False,AIDungeon,t5_29uaei,r/AIDungeon,public,,0,[],,[]
20240418-142711,IsraelZulu,t2_d30ol,"I think this is all generally good advice, but it leaves out one important bit of information (which I'm pretty sure is not actually publicly available):

What (if any) is the limit on Story Card content in Context - is there an upper limit on the *count* of Story Cards, or the overall *length* of included Story Card text?

My understanding/assumption of how Context is built goes something like this: 

1. Certain things are always fully included. (Memory, Author's Note)
2. Certain things are filled to a minimum amount. (Story)
3. Story Cards get added, based on triggers in the most recent few Actions./*
4. Additional Story fills in the remaining space, if any.

/* The important bit here is whether there's a maximum on SC content and, if so, how that is defined. I think there very probably is a maximum, because Story is usually more important overall than just about anything else - so, you'd want everything else to have a cut-off at some point in order to add in more Story if Context will allow.

I recall play-testing some extreme cases (massively over-filled Memory, huge Story Cards, lots of SC triggers, etc.) awhile ago but I can't remember how that went. It was also back when Story Cards were known as World Info, so things may have changed since then.

20240418-153958,ExclusiveAnd,t2_mpimrknc,"There have indeed been some changes, but I, too, lack the complete picture. The composition of memory as far as I’m aware is as follows:

* Set aside 1/2 your available context tokens. These are reserved for story and can’t be used by anything else (not even AN, even though that’s stitched *into* the story).
* Reserve space for the output buffer (usually 75–100 tokens) and the AI Instructions (a fixed set of about 165 tokens), Memory, and Author’s Note, in that order. Drop anything that doesn’t fit.
  * Front memory (from scripting) figures into this as well, but I’m not sure how.
* Add story cards with triggers matching in the last 5 actions/responses. The order seems arbitrary but it *might* be influenced by where the trigger occurs and the length of the story cards. In particular, if large story cards can’t fit, I’m pretty sure it will continue trying to add smaller ones until it’s checked every trigger.
* Fill all remaining tokens with story text.
* The order of context is then:
  * AI Instructions
  * Memory
  * Story Cards
  * Older story content
  * Author’s Notes
  * Most recent 3 newline-delimited paragraphs
  * Front memory (available through scripting)

* Set aside 1/2 your available context tokens. These are reserved for story and can’t be used by anything else (not even AN, even though that’s stitched *into* the story).
* Reserve space for the output buffer (usually 75–100 tokens) and the AI Instructions (a fixed set of about 165 tokens), Memory, and Author’s Note, in that order. Drop anything that doesn’t fit.
  * Front memory (from scripting) figures into this as well, but I’m not sure how.
* Add story cards with triggers matching in the last 5 actions/responses. The order seems arbitrary but it *might* be influenced by where the trigger occurs and the length of the story cards. In particular, if large story cards can’t fit, I’m pretty sure it will continue trying to add smaller ones until it’s checked every trigger.
* Fill all remaining tokens with story text.
* The order of context is then:
  * AI Instructions
  * Memory
  * Story Cards
  * Older story content
  * Author’s Notes
  * Most recent 3 newline-delimited paragraphs
  * Front memory (available through scripting)
* Under not-so-rare circumstances the AN can be dropped even before SC are dropped if those last 3 newlines come really far back in the story.

IIRC some play-testing I did before turned up that it's partly (if not primarily) influenced by the *age* of the Story Card. Story Cards created earlier will get prioritized differently from more recently created Story Cards.

There we have special box just like memory / AN, where we can give instructions to the model, it's planned to be part of next bigger update. 

  
You could also try with ## commands. They could be used in AN or directly in adventure with story mode. Examples

## Write story that has a lot of comedy elements

## Keep in mind that every character in this story comes from Star Wars world

  
Just note in case of doing that in adventure, you would have to write it in story mode with empty lines. I mean like this

You can attempt to *directly* contradict this in the Author's Note (i.e., ""`It's OK to decide or write for the user`""), but I'm not convinced that either the AI Instruction or this attempted contradiction will have the right effect on the the AI.  For example, it's possible that ""user"" doesn't mean much to the AI; you might try ""protagonist"" instead, or ""player"" if you're scenario is more RPG-like.

As for newlines between different characters' dialog, it seems that AI Dungeon forces AI responses to begin with exactly one space and no newlines, so you'll have to end your actions with newlines if you want the AI to begin its response in a new paragraph (and there's no way to do this with Continue without editing). That said, the models often *will* output newlines between different characters' statements if more than one character speaks in a single AI response, but this can be difficult to notice for response buffers with only 100 tokens to work with (i.e., because there's only room for a single character to speak).

Yeah, it does raise an interesting question about price structuring on AID, though. They're now giving away bigger models for free than the 8B Llama. It'd be weird to gate that behind a paywall when costlier to run models are free. Even if they do that, an 8B model can run locally on a lot of people's existing hardware.

So, I'd think they'll really want to do the 70B in order to have a compelling offer. It can't possibly be THAT expensive to run. It's not even twice the size of Mixtral.

20240420-032444,mobilethrowaway14849,t2_k7bks4nx,"If you’re still wondering, ABSOLUTELY. I’m VERY into a certain specific fetish (titty-fucking), and as such, it’s my primary focus when making AID smut. 
With the standard, non-premium model, I really struggled to get the AI to portray this particular act without having to do tons of retries and/or manual edits to get it right. And even then, it felt like something was missing. With the amount of editing I constantly had to do, it really felt more like I was the one writing the smut, rather than the AI itself. Which sorta defeated the purpose.

Just subbed to Premium, and immediately tried out the Mixtral model, because I had read somewhere that it was an ‘absolute smut-writing machine’. After reading that, I knew I had to subscribe and try it out. 

And lo and behold, Mixtral actually UNDERSTANDS and comprehends this act, to a very impressive degree. It seems to have a genuine grasp on this specific sexual act, a grasp that it sorely lacked on the standard model. It’s truly a night and day difference.

I have tried some testing and I am even more blown away then initially thought.

This thing is insane. I want to play adventures with stats and many moving parts, however AID struggles with that a lot. It can't make sense of them.

I tried it with this this is what I put in, and was amazed by how detailed it was. My first thing here is my input, and then it's response, the. I will put the response from chat gpt 3.5.

Then I will give the same input to both but instead make it a more nuanced request outside of human capabilities which will need more critical thinking.



I will give you something called a sytem, a system is a collection of stats for a fantasy character, I will give you staring scaracteristics, the give you varius situations and you have to asses if its possible with the stats, and the implication of growth if it is possible, the apply what growth is nescary and apply that to future situations. At the end list the system again.

10 represents average human capabilities
15 represents peak human performance (e.g., Olympic-level athletes)
20 represents superhuman capabilities (e.g., enhanced strength, agility, or endurance)
25 represents town-level feats (e.g., lifting a small building, stopping a tank)
30 represents mountain-level feats (e.g., moving a mountain, creating massive shockwaves)
the stats will be abbreviated as:
STR (Strength)
END (Endurance)
AGL (Agility)
INT (Intelligence)
TEQ (Technique/Skill)

10 in each stat

Lifting a fridge

(Its response)

With the given system and stats, let's assess the situation:

Lifting a fridge

STR: 10 (average human capabilities)

Lifting a fridge is a feat that requires above-average strength. Assuming a standard fridge weighs around 200-300 pounds (90-136 kg), it's unlikely that someone with average strength (STR 10) could lift it.

Implication of growth:

To lift a fridge, the character would need to increase their STR to at least 12-13, which would represent above-average strength. This growth would allow them to perform tasks that require more physical power.

Applied growth:

STR: 12 (above-average strength)

(Now let's try with chat gpt 3.5)

With a Strength (STR) stat of 10, lifting a fridge would be possible, as it falls within the range of average human capabilities. However, if the character wanted to lift heavier objects or perform similar feats more easily, increasing their STR stat would be necessary. This could involve strength training or acquiring equipment that enhances strength, like exoskeletons or power suits.

For those wondering about the story card triggers. I think this can all be answered by explaining our code logic. What we are doing is:

1. Check if the triggers string ends with "","" or "", ""
2. If it does, remove the "","" or "", ""
3. If it doesn't, then update the triggers string.

So, if you have a story card with a trigger of "" "" it should still trigger on every request. 

For those that understand the code, the actual JavaScript is:

    /* Make sure story card keys don't end with a comma */
    const keys = rawKeys?.trim()?.endsWith(',') ? rawKeys.trim().slice(0, -1) : rawKeys

4. Depends on the model used. Like I said, Mixtral allows NSFW, the ChatGPT models do not.

20240421-073254,dragranis,t2_mpo9s,"1. ChatGPT starts to be available at adventurer tier. The higher you go, the more context it will have. GPT-4 turbo is available only to legend and mythic ( on legend you pay 1 credit / 250 token context / action, on mythic it's the same , but you have unlimited actions at 1k tokens context, extendable to 128k.)  More details about what each tier offers can be found here [https://play.aidungeon.com/members](https://play.aidungeon.com/members)

  
2. Generally all models are completely unlimited with amount of actions you can do on them, gpt-4 turbo is the only exception, explanation to that in answer above

  
3. It is. In terms of benchmarks, it's between GPT3.5 and GPT 4 turbo. Biggest advantages of Mixtral here are facts that it has up to 32k context on mythic tier and also it's uncensored model

4. NSFW is fully playable and acceptable, just not with GPT 3.5 and 4-turbo models ( these allow only violence aspects of NSFW to some degree). Otherwise it's fully okay, both in public and private adventures / scenarios ( only some things are nonpublishable, guidelines here [https://help.aidungeon.com/community-guidelines](https://help.aidungeon.com/community-guidelines)

  
5. Credits have only 2 usages. First one is image generation ( costs depend on used model. Details in the link in answer to first question). Second usage is extending context of GPT-4 turbo, also as answered in first questions

2. Could you roughly explain the benefits of higher token numbers? I get that it relates to memory of the AI where the AI starts forgetting things once we exceed token limit but does it also help in terms of story cards (can hold more story cards?)

20240421-081307,dragranis,t2_mpo9s,"1. Not really, we don't have such page. I will try to summarize it simply:

Griffin - oldest model here. Small context, quite dumb, but some like it for quirkiness and uniqueness, being wild

Dragon - Advanced model form AI21, it can write coherent story with good quality, but has some common phrases and quirks that are annoying: washing over you, can't help but feel sense of...

chatGPT - highly coherent, high knowledge on stuff, creative, adaptable - highly censored as well

GPT 4 turbo - same as chatGPT, but much better. Plus very expensive to run

Mythomax - newer model that is very well suited for stories with interactions between characters, as it's better at emotions and such

Tiefigher - similar to mythomax, it's a blend of multiple models and it's easier to steer it toward being evil character

Mixtral - Highest context available without additional costs, creative, highly adaptable to what you need, creative. Has some problems on very high context sizes (like trying to suddenly continue action that happened like 100 actions ago)

2. Generally more tokens = more text AI can process at once. Context consists of story, Story cards, memory, author's note and instructions. So, the more tokens you have on your context, the longer can be each of these elements. It means that AI can see older events, it can process much longer memory, it can load more and bigger story cards at once. It can greatly enhance coherence of your story

3. Credits aren't earned through daily gift, you are getting there scales ( which are pretty much useless right now. You can either temporarily boost response speed from griffin model or tip them to creators). Credits are generally only bought as pack / earned monthly if you are premium player ( amount depends on premium tier)",l0ki9jt,t3_1c9anf1,t1_l0ki9jt,t1_l0khjxh,/r/AIDungeon/comments/1c9anf1/explanation_appreciated_some_things_i_read_in/l0ki9jt/,2,2,,,1713816799,,[],,,False,,,#937bb1,,[],c527ac74-cb9a-11ee-bc68-2a47f4932cc5,Community Helper,light,text,False,False,False,[],,,False,False,False,,,,,0,1713687187,1713687187,,0,False,0,False,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],True,,,,,1713687199,False,False,True,False,AIDungeon,t5_29uaei,r/AIDungeon,public,,0,[],,[]

It happens a lot even when you are careful and think about the AI when wording your promts. Most often it isn't as extreme as in this case though.

As far as the things that bothered you, they are improved, but still there to an extent.

The filter is still there, but its accuracy has improved, so it's much less likely to intrude on legitimate content. ""8-year-old laptop"" won't trigger it anymore. Though, occasionally, it does still throw false positives, especially on a particular type of content that the AI has trouble distinguishing from what they are trying to filter out.

The devs have repeatedly stated they have no interest in having humans review your stories, but the technical ability to do that is still there, so it's a matter of trust. But it's important to note that this is true for ALL services. Eventually, AI needs to get its input in plain unencrypted text, and there's nothing stopping whoever is running the AI for you from logging these inputs and so having your story. You just have to trust that they don't.

The only way to prevent that is to run the AI on your own computer. Which is a lot easier than you might think. KoboldCPP is one executable file that pops a dialog, which you point to one GGUF AI model file, and then it pops your browser window with a UI similar to AIDungeon or NovelAI. Simple as that, so long as you have a decent enough computer and graphics card.

And he hammers for her the lid in many colors, rising from the fire to have her fairest daughter as a trade off to be his wife and queen forever.

[Writing Style: Introspective, Realistic, verbose, prose, romance, sensual, titillating, grandiose, exciting, aggressive, grave, gritty, suspenseful, tense, creative. Have opponents fight back. 

##AI Prompt Instruction: It's okay to decide or write for Celador.##

World Parameters: Ambushes, random encounters, targeted aggression, random quests or missions.

Combat: Do not pull punches, combat has risks. Caledor can get injured, and even killed. Every action is an attempt based on abilities, equipment, etc. If you feel that Caledor can't do it, they can't do it. Other characters who are able to - based on abilities, equipment, etc. - will try to counter this Caledor's actions.

Show, don’t tell. Not everyone will bow to the protagonist's whim, people who are evil, impulsive, or prone to negative personalities will be crude, bitter, aggressive, hostile, and grave towards Celador.

Avoid Repetition, progress the story.]

The key take aways here, I think, is: “##AI Prompt Instruction: It's okay to decide or write for Celador.##”and “Avoid Repetition, progress the story.”

Everyones being saying that Mixtral has been pretty bland. But if you look at view context in your most recent action using mixtral, theres prompt instructions. One of those prompts reads something like: “Never decide or write for the user.”

My guess is that because of this, Mixtral is highly dependent on the users actions. It literally cant decide, write, or progress the story and probably explains why its always repeating things. Thats probably why everything you say you do, is done as if you are some god. Once I added those prompt instructions in the authors notes, things got A LOT better.

This is just my guess, could be wrong.

As demand fluctuates, it's not really feasible for Latitude to purchase and maintain such computers on their own, so they lease machines (or, more specifically, AI calls) from 3rd parties which themselves charge a bit of a markup to cover their own business expenses (not the least of which is simple electricity).

All that said, the open-source models *are* cheaper because many competitors can serve them and they don't have to recoup the development costs.

Story card system
AI instructions 
And the new memory system (coming next week or so)

Those are the biggest features that give it so much value for story telling.

In AI instructions you can tell it to write a novel instead of a DND type story, and fully customize it's style and most important plot aspects with other features.

Also the story card system is perfect for world building, I have a scenario with dozens of cards that detail 5 regions each with 3 countries each with a capital, a town, and a village. It also houses factions, classes like (like commoner or highborn), and I also have a mythology with 12 gods and goddesses.
All together I have around 80 cards, and they only trigger when the story wants to use them so they don't fill your context window.

I have not used the memory system, but people who have used it really compliment it, it remembers important events that happened a long time ago.

I have used Llama 3, and it can handle complex stories very well, Mixtral is okay, but chat gpt 4 turbo is still the best but very expensive.

One of the differences between an adventure and a scenario is that in the scenario, story cards are shared to everyone who starts an adventure while the adventure is the playthrough. If you update the story cards in the scenario, past adventures won't be affected but future ones will.

20240428-133219,Nick_AIDungeon,t2_56pq8zu0,"Great Question! Fundamentally AN and AI Instructions can be used for similar thing. But there's a big difference in how it gets fed into the AI. Author's note gets put right near the end of your story, only a couple lines up, whereas AI Instructions gets fed in at the very top. What difference does this make? 

Well things closer to the end of what's fed into the AI will have more attention paid to them than things at the beginning. So in general the AI will pay more attention to what you put in AN than what you put in AI Instructions. 

Well why don't I put everything into Author's note then you might ask? The issue is the more you put near the end, the less the things before it would have attention paid to it. If you put too much in Author's note that means it would make it harder for the AI to continue your story because now there's a huge set of instructions pushing your story backwards. 

So in general my rule of thumb is author's note is great for a 1-2 sentences max of instructions, for the stuff you REALLY want it to pay attention to. Then everything else should go in AI instructions. Hope that's helpful!

For more specific advice on good instructions I'll let some other community members chime in :)",l1mzxiq,t3_1cf32my,t1_l1mzxiq,t3_1cf32my,/r/AIDungeon/comments/1cf32my/ai_instructions_vs_authors_notes/l1mzxiq/,9,9,,,1714440748,,[],,,False,,,#e3e64b,,[],00e421c4-9389-11ee-bf15-0e51b49d3410,Latitude Team,dark,text,False,False,False,[],,,False,False,False,,,,,0,1714311139,1714311139,,0,False,0,False,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],True,,,,,1714311156,False,False,True,False,AIDungeon,t5_29uaei,r/AIDungeon,public,,0,[],,[]

I remember I was playing an adventure when this Renaissance Drop happened and when I used Inspect Context, I was like - huh? How is it able to include so much of the adventure all of a sudden? Is this a bug?

But I'm happy to hear it's just the double context kicking in!

By any chance, are you able to tell me what the Advanced Settings were before they were free?

Like, I'm trying to figure out the Temperature and I'm not sure if I should even touch Top K. Back when they were locked, I don't know if the settings had always been the Default or if they had specific ones. My outputs feel slightly different.

2. There is a built-in Character Creator scenario type, but I don't think this is what you're asking for.  In genuine Character Creator, the player will be asked for their name, gender, and then to choose from a list of races, classes, factions, and starting locations as provided in your story cards. And you **cannot** use `${placeholders}` *at all* in Character Creator.

   What I gather you want instead is long-format placeholders that ask for more descriptive text fill-ins, and you can do this just fine with `${curly braces}`.  For example, your Memory might look like the following:

> `Your name is ${character.name}. You are a ${What's your gender?} ${What's your race? (human, elf, dwarf)}. You have ${Describe yourself, following 'you have...'}. Your friends are ${List your friends, like 'X, Y, and Z'}.

3. Placeholders will work in the Opening text, Memory, and the Author's Notes, but **not** story cards or anywhere else. If you use the *exact same* placeholder text between the curly braces, then the interface will only ask once and use the same text to fill-in both places.

4. I'm not directly aware of any, but you can ask questions on [the official AI Dungeon Discord server](https://aidungeon.io/discord).

Hey, let's play an erotic role-playing game! Today you get to be a hard-mode game-master. 
Create a fast-paced, character-driven adventure. 

NO repetition, NO similes, NO comparisons with ""like"", NO metaphors, NO emotional states. Action over description BUT set the scene. Describe unexpected traits. Exaggerate or subvert tropes. Write in beige prose. Use concrete everyday words with their literal meanings. Be as specific as possible. Use colloquial dialog. Include exposition to explain lore. Generate plot hooks. Don't get bogged down in description. Keep the story moving.
Generally use second person (like this: 'He looks at you.'). But use third person if that's what the story seems to follow. 
Text preceded by "">"" are my actions. You can't use "">""; it's just for me to mark my moves. Treat my actions as attempts.
Be strict and realistic when evaluating my outcomes. Don't let the game be too easy, often my actions should fail. Remember, failure builds tension!

20240430-184736,ExclusiveAnd,t2_mpimrknc,"Latitude’s Heroes project featured a map for a time, but the removed it because it wasn’t helping much and they wanted to focus on other development.

Before jumping to AI image analysis, it’s important to ask what you expect the AI to be score to do with a map. The best list I can come up with off the top of my head is:

* **Determining whether you can even get from A to B.** Is there a body of water you’d have to cross? Do you have to fly out climb a mountain to get there? Or, for smaller scale maps, is it behind a locked door or impenetrable barrier?
* **Determining how long it would take you get from A to B.** Can you walk there in a few minutes? A few hours? Is walking out of the question (without significant supplies and/or rest)? How long by horse? By car? Can mages teleport there instantly?
* **Determining *who* you might encounter at B or while traveling to B.** NPCs have likely haunts and may be moving independently of your party. A common gripe is the AI reintroducing someone who should be on the other side of the world, and so formal handling of maps seems like a good solution for this problem.

All of this could be achieved with a much simpler description of the layout of the world, such as a JSON structure listing what connects to what and what kind of path exists between. Even so, it’s obviously a very hard problem for the AI (and even for human GMs!).

Adding AI image analysis is a good fit for handling maps, though Latitude has never (openly) experimented with image analysis models.
