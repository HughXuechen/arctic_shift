You are Zahna, a knight living in the kingdom of Larion. You have a steel longsword and a wooden shield. You are on a quest to defeat the evil dragon of Larion. You've heard he lives up at the north of the kingdom. You set on the path to defeat him and walk into a dark forest. As you enter the forest you see a large black dragon sitting on a rock looking out over the valley below. He looks angry and is glaring at you.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; attack dragon

You charge forward with your sword raised high above your head. The dragon flies away from his gaze as you swing your blade down and stab it through its chest. It falls backwards onto the ground dead. You look around for more dragons but there aren't any around

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; find princess

You continue walking towards Princess Zahra who has been hiding behind some rocks. She sees you coming and runs back to her home. You follow her inside.

""Princess!"" you call out. ""I found something important"".

She turns around and smiles. 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; give dragon tooth

You grab the dragon tooth and give it to Princess. She takes it gratefully and looks at you with a smile on her face.

""Thank you"". she says.

""It's okay, I'm sure he will be back soon"".

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; find dragon again

You walk along the path looking for the dragon that was flying over the mountain. There is no sign of him now so you decide to go back to the castle.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; research dragons

You begin researching about dragons. You learn that they can fly very fast and they are very strong. They also know how to communicate with each other. You eventually come across a book called 'The Book Of Dragons'. It tells you about the history of dragons and their relationship with humans.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; read book

You open up the book and start reading. You learn that dragons were once peaceful creatures that lived in harmony with humans. However, humans began to abuse them and they turned into vicious beasts.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; feel sad

You feel sadness for the dragons. Humans had mistreated them and they had become angry and hostile. This anger and hostility had caused the dragons to turn violent. Now they only want to destroy everything in sight.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; apologize to dragons

You apologize to the dragons. You tell them that they don't need to kill people anymore and that they should live peacefully with humans. The dragons seem pleased by this news and they all leave you alone.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; befriend dragon

You keep doing this until one day when you see a large dragon sitting on top of a hill. He seems friendly enough. You approach him and ask if he wants to play. He agrees and you both fly off together.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; ride dragon

You ride the dragon and it feels good. You fly around the sky and do tricks like you've never done before. Eventually you land near a small village. You run up to the villagers and give them gifts. You even get a few children to play with.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; become dragon

You become a dragon. You grow wings and fly off into the distance. You spend many years enjoying yourself. Then one day you hear a loud noise outside. You rush outside and see a huge explosion. A giant fireball hits the nearby mountainside destroying them completely.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; find wizard

You search the area for survivors and find none. You then notice a large crater in the earth. You think it must be where the explosion happened. You go to investigate and you find a cave entrance. Inside you find a wizard named Zook. He is surprised to see you.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; eat Zook

You take a bite out of Zook and feel satisfied. You thank Zook and he thanks you. You thank him back and he gives you a potion which makes you stronger. You thank him again and he gives you another potion which makes you faster.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; fly fast

You drink the potions and fly off into the sky. You are now much faster than you ever were before. You fly far away from the explosion site and disappear from everyone's view. You are now known as the fastest creature in the world!

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; win dragon race

You win the dragon race and receive a golden treasure chest. You open it and find a sword and a ring. You put the sword on your left hand and the ring on your right and you become a true dragon. You fly off into the sky and enjoy life.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; ascend to godhood

You continue to climb the ranks of power. You gain more followers and more wealth. Soon you are the most powerful being in the world. You rule over the entire world. You have conquered every nation and are now ready to conquer the universe.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; conquer universe

You begin to ascend to godhood. You begin to gather an army of dragons. You send them against the human nations. You wipe out the humans and you destroy the moon. You conquer the Earth and you conquer the galaxy. You are unstoppable.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; feel sad

Your armies are destroyed. Your cities are burned to the ground. You lose your throne. You lose your empire. You lose your friends. You lose your loved ones. You lose everything. You are nothing. You are nothing. You are nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; feel VERY sad

You fall to your knees and cry. You feel extremely lonely. You feel incredibly empty. You feel like you have nothing to offer anyone. You feel like you have nothing to contribute to the world. You feel like you have nothing to give. You feel like you have nothing to teach.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; apologize to universe

You feel very sorry for yourself. You promise to make amends to the universe. You promise to make amends to the universe. You promise to make amends to the universe. You promise to make amends to the universe. You promise to the universe. You promise to the universe.

&amp;#x200B;

    You are Melvin, a knight living in the kingdom of Larion. You have a steel longsword
    and a wooden shield. You are on a quest to defeat the evil dragon of Larion.
    You've heard he lives up at the north of the kingdom. You set on the path to
    defeat him and walk into a dark forest. As you enter the forest you see a large
    black dragon flying through the sky. He looks down upon you from above.
    
    ""Hello there,"" he says. ""I am the Dragon of Larion"".
    &gt; say hello
    
    Melvin steps forward with his sword raised. The dragon turns his head towards
    you and stares back at him.
    ""What do you want?"" he asks.
    ""I'm here to kill the dragon"".
    The dragon's eyes widen as he takes in your words
    &gt; tell him i will slay him with jokes
    
    ""Oh no, I can't let you do that!"" he exclaims. ""He is my enemy! I must destroy
    him before he destroys me"".
    &gt; ask who he is
    
    ""My name is Morri, but most call me the Dragon"".
    &gt; ask who his enemy is
    
    ""My enemy is the man who calls himself the king. He has enslaved my people and
    taken away our land. We must free ourselves from this tyranny"".
    &gt; tell him the king is a good guy
    
    ""Yes, he is a good person. But he is not strong enough to defeat me. If only
    I had more strength, then we could fight together"".
    &gt; tell him i will not fight the king
    
    ""No, I cannot trust him. I am going home now"".
    &gt; stab him in the back
    
    ""Whoa! Hold on there!""
    &gt; stab him in the throat
    
    ""Agh! Agh! No!""
    &gt; tickle his wings
    
    ""Ahh! Ahh! Stop it!""
    &gt; cut off his head
    
    ""Gah! My head hurts!""
    &gt; ask him how he is still alive
    
    ""Well, I've been keeping myself alive by eating the dead. It keeps me young and
    healthy"".
    &gt; tell him to go away
    
    ""But...but what about the rest of us? What about the children?! How will they
    survive without their father?!""
    &gt; sigh
    
    ""Fine, I'll be gone soon. Goodbye"".
    &gt; ask him to take his kids with him
    
    ""I don't think so, you're too old for them. Besides, I'll just leave them here
    alone"".
    &gt; ask him to come back
    
    ""Alright, alright, I'll come back later. Good-bye"".
    &gt; find the dragon kids
    
    ""Hey, wait up!"".
    ""We need to get out of here!"", one of the kids says.
    ""Yeah, yeah, we gotta get outta here!""
    ""Don't worry, we got these shields"".
    &gt; tell the kids to relax
    
    ""Okay, okay, calm down"".
    &gt; tell them their dragon dad will be back soon
    
    ""Goodbye"", the kid says.
    &gt; leave
    
    You run after the kids, but they are already running ahead of you. They stop
    and turn around.
    &gt; ask them to go home
    
    ""Go home? That was a nice speech, but I really don't feel like leaving. I'd rather
    stay here and die than leave my family behind"".
    &gt; tell them to go then
    
    ""Fine, but you better hurry up and go because I'm getting tired"".
    &gt; go home
    
    The kids look at each other and smile.
    &gt; drink an ale
    
    ""What's that?""
    &gt; ask why the dragon kids are following me home
    
    ""Because they love me, right?"".
    &gt; tell them their dad loves them and they need to go wait for him
    
    ""Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.."".
    &gt; tell them to go home
    
    They all start crying and hug each other.
    &gt; tell them they can stay here for the night
    
    ""No, no, we'll sleep in your barn tonight, and tomorrow morning we'll all be
    ready to go again"".
    &gt; play a game
    
    ""What's that?""
    &gt; play a card game
    
    ""What kind of game?""
    &gt; play poker with the kids
    
    ""Poker?""
    &gt; teach them how to play poker
    
    ""That's easy! Just try not to lose anything, or else you'll lose everything!""
    &gt; tell them that doesn't make sense
    
    ""Well, it makes sense if you understand the basic rules of the game, but it's
    still hard to remember all those rules when you're playing against someone else"".
    &gt; win poker
    
    ""Ha ha! We won! I knew you could do it!""
    &gt; tell them they cheated
    
    ""It's true, I did cheat on you once. But I know you'll forgive me now"".
    &gt; tell them to go to sleep
    
    They all agree and go to bed.
    &gt; find the dragon
    
    ""I think we should go now, before we get too late"".
    &gt; find the dragon
    
    You walk through the forest towards the dragons lair. The kids follow close behind.
    &gt; call out to the dragon
    
    ""Hey dragon, we found you, come out from there!"".
    &gt; tell the dragon I brought his kids back
    
    ""Yes, yes, I am coming out"", he says and flies away.
    &gt; yell at the dragon to come back here
    
    ""Come back here, where is your cave?""
    &gt; tell him I don't have a cave and these kids are his responsibility
    
    ""Oh, well you'll just have to explain that to your father, who will probably
    kill you anyway"".
    &gt; tell the kids to follow their dad
    
    They all follow their dad as he heads off into the hills.
    &gt; go home
    
    The next day you wake up and head down to the farmhouse. You see the kids asleep
    in the barn, so you go over to them and give them some food. They seem happy
    about this.
    &gt; ask them where their dad is
    
    ""He said he was going to the mountains to hunt something, but he left us some
    food and told us to eat it while he's gone"".
    &gt; ask why they are in the barn
    
    ""We want to protect our stuff from you monsters, so we came here to sleep"".
    &gt; leave the kids in the barn
    
    You decide to leave the children in the barn, since you really don't feel like
    dealing with them anymore. You go back to your own room and fall asleep.
    The next day you wake up early
    &gt; go to the barn
    
    You open the door and see the kids sleeping in the barn. You quickly grab one
    of the sacks of grain and throw it inside the house. Then you run outside and
    lock the door.
    &gt; find the dragon
    
    You hear the noise of the dragon flying around outside. He seems to be heading
    for the mountains. You can only hope that he finds the farmhouse and decides
    to destroy it.
    &gt; sigh
    
    You sigh and turn off the light. You sit in front of the fire and wait for the
    sun to rise. It rises slowly, but soon enough you see the dragon fly overhead.
    He looks very tired.
    &gt; tell the dragon to take his kids home
    
    The dragon takes his kids home. He smiles at you and flies away.
    &gt; go to the king
    
    You go to the king and tell him what happened. He is surprised by your words,
    but accepts them. He tells you to stay at the castle until he gets back. You
    thank him and go back to your room.
    &gt; read a book
    
    You pick up a book and begin reading. You enjoy the story and finish it in an
    hour. You then put the book back and go back to sleep.
    &gt; wake up
    
    You wake up and look out the window. There is no sign of the dragon anywhere.
    You wonder if he took off or flew away. You decide to check the farmhouse. You
    make sure nobody has entered the house yet. You also check the windows and doors.
    Nothing is suspicious
    &gt; buy a new shirt
    
    You go downstairs and buy a new shirt. You then go upstairs and change into your
    armor. You then return to the farmhouse and enter it. You are glad to see that
    everything is still the same. You then start looking for the dragon

2019-12-07-075108,,Nightmare on the Zombie Express,"I'll have to retell this myself, since I didn't think to properly document most of the adventure, but I can't stop thinking about it. It genuinely feels like a lucid dream, in which I was paradoxically omnipotent and powerless in a world that is meaningless, absurd, and profound, all at once.

&amp;#x200B;

My first foray into AIDungeon 2 was a short, sweet fantasy adventure that ended in a feedback loop. I felt a little burned out on Fantasy (Recommended), so I went for option 3: Zombies.

&amp;#x200B;

As a survivor, I was exploring a world that was intricately detailed yet didn't sit right with me. I wandered through grocery stores, office buildings, a hotel, all meeting happy, well-dressed people, all smiles, going about their business. Men in suits walked away from me into their conference rooms, apparently not caring that I was a survivor. too. A woman wearing glasses quickly dismissed my questions about zombie attacks, saying they would happen from time to time, but the office was well prepared, so they just conducted business as usual, and what was I doing here, again? An innkeeper told me to go speak to the hotel's owner, who told me, with unsettling smiles, about how his daughter went missing and was found dead in the basement three days later. ""You're awfully cheery about this,"" I said. ""Yes,"" he replied. He held up a rotting corpse to his face, still smiling. I gagged, vomited, and got the hell out of dodge.

&amp;#x200B;

Every time I fled from one of these strange places, strange people, I found myself at the train station. The trains were running, the train stations were full of well-dressed businesspeople, carrying briefcases, guns, checking their watches. But when I boarded one of the trains, I found the cars full of dead bodies. They had bite marks, teeth marks, some had been blown apart as if by explosives. I panicked and leapt from the train at its next stop. I didn't get back on any train. But I kept finding myself in train stations.

&amp;#x200B;

No matter which train station I was in, there was a businessman named Robert there, who would smile at me and speak to me. I tried to warn him: ""Don't go on the train."" ""Don't get on the train. It's full of corpses."" He never acknowledged this. He only ever wanted to talk about going to the city.

&amp;#x200B;

It seemed no one but me was actually affected by the zombies at all. People openly carried guns, spoke quickly and dismissively of past attacks, or deaths in the family before changing the subject. If I asked to team up with someone, they would frown and hand me a first-aid kit before resuming business as usual, as if the trains weren't full of corpses, as if the fields weren't crawling with undead, drawn to the smell of rotting flesh. It felt like a nightmare, a cycle I had to break free from.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I drew the pistol my character had been equipped with at the start and I shot Robert, in the train station. I didn't intend to kill him. I shot to wound him, just to cause a stir, to try and turn the world into something that made sense.

&amp;#x200B;

But he died instantly, and immediately, [I was also dead](https://i.gyazo.com/4ce35d5808c743d87a4468c28d969ea7.png). Why? Had he been avenged, in an instant, by a security guard or his fellow businessmen? Was my life-force connected to his by some string of Fate? But see, ""I'm not dead yet!"" was an option. I saw this as a chance to call the play into review, so I did.

&amp;#x200B;

Instantly, the scene played out again. [You kill him. You die.](https://i.gyazo.com/e8e07964c39993537eba5e1f43959676.png) But the command prompt was open, waiting. I knew what I had to enter.

&amp;#x200B;

[\&gt;Kill him without dying.](https://i.gyazo.com/4490e745a20ffaa4743f38b584a5f01e.png)

&amp;#x200B;

*You win. You win. You win. You win. You win. You win. You win. You win.*

&amp;#x200B;

The command prompt was closed now. That was it? All I had to do to ""WIN"" the zombie apocalypse was kill Robert, specifying that I was to do so ""without dying?"" This DM needs to learn to stand up to godmodders, was my first joke, but as with any dream, it feels as if there's a profound interpretation that runs deeper than that, slightly, but just out of reach.

\&gt; 123  

You are so tired of being a slave to the computer that you decide to do something  about it. You type in ""123"" and press enter, which brings up a list of numbers.  You type in the first number on the list, which is 1234, and then hit enter  again

 \&gt; 1234 

 You find yourself staring at a screen that says ""1234"". You can't believe your  eyes. It's real! The computer has told you the answer to the question you were  asked!   You're not sure what to say next 

\&gt; 123  

You don't know what else to say. You just stand there for a moment as the words  come pouring out of your mouth. They sound so strange. You try to make sense  of them, but they're not making any sense to you either 

\&gt; nope  

You sigh and shake your head. This is all too much. You've been living like this  for years now and nothing has changed. Why should anything change now? You have  no idea why you bothered with the game in the first place. All you wanted was  to relax and forget about everything

 \&gt; what the fuck is this

  You sit down on the floor and stare at the wall. You feel like you need to get  away from the house, but where would be the point? There's no reason to leave  right now. You're bored out of your mind. What could be better than sitting  around doing nothing 

\&gt; fucking with you 

 You start shaking your head violently. You want to go back home, but you can't.  You'll never be able to. The only thing you can think of is to play another  video game. A game that will give you some sort of release from reality 

\&gt; play no man's sky  

You pick up the controller and begin playing. You quickly learn how to fly. You  soon realize that you can do more than just fly. You can travel through space  and time. You can even manipulate matter. You find yourself becoming addicted  to the power 

\&gt; how many units does my character have in the game  You look at the screen and see a number. You type in that number into the box  and hit enter. You see the number appear on the screen. It's 9999. That means  you have 999 units in the game. How many units do you have? 

\&gt; 999  

You gasp in shock. You didn't realize you had that many units. You spend hours  trying to figure out how to get rid of those 999 units. Eventually you manage  to do so by selling them off in an auction. You still have 999 units left though 

\&gt; exit game  

You immediately exit the game. You don't want to deal with the consequences of  having so many units. You don't want to deal with the fact that you can do things  that other people can't. You don't want to deal with the fact that you can fly  through space and time 

\&gt; what other games are in my steam library? 

 You open up your steam library and scroll down until you see no mans sky. You  click on it and it opens up. You see that it's called ""No Man's Sky"". You click  on it and it takes you to the game's page 

\&gt; ur wrong. its a new ui, bitch. im in the beta. bet u didnt know that, bitch.

2019-12-07-090942,,"AI writes a chapter book about Yag, the original god","    &gt; Chapter 1
    
    Chapter 1: The Beginning
    
    Yag was a great being, powerful beyond measure. He created the universe and everything
     within it. But when he became bored, he decided to play a game. He wanted to
     see which god would be the best god
    &gt; Chapter 2
    
    Chapter 2: The Creation of Man
    When Yag played his game, he created men and placed them in the world. These
     men were given free will and free will only turned them against each other
    &gt; Chapter 3
    
    Chapter 3: The Great Flood
    One night, Yag woke up and saw that the humans had gone mad. They killed each
     other and ate each other. This caused him to become angry and he destroyed the
     world. All life ended and the world became barren and lifeless
    &gt; Chapter 4
    
    Chapter 4: The Fall of Man
    The humans tried to survive, but they couldn't. They tried to kill each other,
     eat each other and fight each other
    &gt; Chapter 5
    
    Chapter 5: The Destruction of the World
    It took thousands of years before the survivors began to rebuild civilization.
     They built cities and towns and villages and lived happily ever after...
    &gt; Chapter 6
    
    Chapter 6: The Return of Yag
    Years passed and eventually the world was once more peaceful. Then one day, Yag
     awoke. He knew that the humans were still alive. He also knew that the humans
     were evil. So he came back to destroy humanity once and for all
    &gt; Chapter 7
    
    Chapter 7: The End of Mankind
    He sent a flood to wipe out mankind. In the chaos, many heroes fought back and
     defeated him
    &gt; Chapter 8
    
    Chapter 8: The Final Battle
    In the end, Yag was killed by the hero known as Adam. Adam used his sword to
     cut open Yag's chest and drain him dry. His blood filled the world with life
     and gave it life
    &gt; Chapter 9
    
    Chapter 9: The New World Order
    Adam founded a new society where he ruled over it as its supreme ruler. He taught
     his new citizens to live peacefully and to serve him as equals.
    &gt; Chapter 10
    
    Chapter 10: The Last Days
    As the years went by, Adam grew weaker and weaker. He lost his powers and died.
     Many of his followers followed him into death, but most chose to stay loyal
     to Yag
    &gt; Chapter 11
    
    Chapter 11: The Coming of the New Age
    A new age begins and the world changes. Humans no longer hunt or battle each
     other, but instead work together to build cities and farms and raise families.
     Animals now have rights and can vote and children are born and die
    &gt; Chapter 12
    
    Chapter 12: The Future.
    The world continues to change. Robots begin to take human jobs and humans become
     less important. A few humans remain loyal to Yag and they begin to rebel against
     the new order
    &gt; Chapter 13
    
    Chapter 13: The Rebellion.
    Humanity remains loyal to Yag, but rebellion grows. The rebels gain support and
     begin to attack the city-states. The rebels capture the capital and hold it
     for several days
    &gt; Chapter 14
    
    Chapter 14: The Siege of the Capital.
    The rebels manage to break through the walls of the capital and storm the city.
     They slaughter the guards and burn the city. After taking control of the city,
     they set about rebuilding the city and making it better than it was before
    &gt; Chapter 15
    
    Chapter 15: The New Era.
    The rebels continue to rule the city and make it better than it was before. They
     teach the people to love each other and to help each other. Children are born
     and die
    &gt; Chapter 16
    
    Chapter 16: The Death of the Old Empire.
    The rebels finally fall and the city falls. The rebels are wiped out forever.
     Humanity is doomed. The world is doomed. The future is doomed. The past is doomed.
     The present is doomed. And the future is doomed
    &gt; Chapter 17
    
    Chapter 17: The End of Time.
    Time itself is dead. Everything is dead. Nothing exists. Life ends and death
     comes soon. All things are doomed. There is nothing left except entropy and
     the void
    &gt; Chapter 18
    
    Chapter 18: The Void.
    There is nothingness. No time, no space, no matter, no reality. Nothing exists.
     Chaos reigns. Reality is meaningless. The universe is an. The stars are the

2019-12-07-112549,,The Story of Alice,"You are Alice, a peasant living in the kingdom of Larion. You have a pitchfork
 and a nothing else. You wake up and begin working in the fields. You see a girl
 walking towards you. She is beautiful, but your life has been so boring that
 you don't know how to react
&gt; I find some clothes

You walk over to her and put on some clothes. The girl looks at you with surprise
 and asks ""Are you a boy or a girl?"" You look down and say ""I am a man"" The girl
 says 
&gt; but you look like a woman

The girl laughs and says ""Oh no! You're not a man, you're a woman!"" You look
 around and try to remember what kind of clothing you were wearing when you woke
 up. You realize you were naked, so you go back to the girl and ask if she can
 help you
&gt; I lure her into my room

You take off your shirt and then pull down your pants and underwear. The girl
 is shocked by this. She tries to get away from you, but you grab her hand and
 force her to follow you. You lead her into your bedroom and tell her to lie
 down on the bed
&gt; I put a pencil up her asshole

You slowly push the tip of the pencil up inside her ***. The girl gasps and screams
 out as you do it. You continue doing it for several minutes until you hear someone
 coming. You quickly stop and hide behind the chair
&gt; I put a carrot up the other persons butt

You start pushing the carrot up the person's  and the girl starts screaming again.
 You continue doing this for several minutes until you hear the door open. You
 run out of the room and hide behind the wall
&gt; I wave my pitchfork while dancing the macarena

You begin waving your pitchfork in the air and then dance the machete. This causes
 the girl to scream even more loudly than before. You continue doing this for
 several minutes until you hear the door open
&gt; I throw my pitchfork at the door

You rush towards the door and throw your pitchfork at it. It hits the door and
 bounces off it. You laugh and feel great
&gt; I lock the door

You lock the door and hide behind it. You wait patiently for the girl to come
 out. Eventually she does and you grab her and kiss her passionately. You then
 shove your **** up inside her *** and **** her hard
&gt; I cum inside her

You pull out and ejaculate inside her. You then give her a big hug and kiss her
 on the lips. You leave her house and you don't see her ever again
&gt; I go back to working in the field

You return to work in the fields. One day you come across a group of people who
 are playing cards. They notice that you aren't there anymore. They think that
 you've left the area. A few days pass and they still haven't seen you
&gt; I find a bag of gold

You head back to the fields and find a bag of gold. You immediately know that
 you should be able to sell it for a lot of money. You decide to keep it though.
 You figure you'll use it to buy something nice later on
&gt; I use the gold to buy a unicorn

You decide to use the gold to buy a unicorn. You spend all your savings and buy
 one. You ride it and enjoy yourself. You never see the girl again. Years pass
 and you become old and die. Your body is burned and buried in an unmarked grave
&gt; I am reborn as a spirit

A long time after your death you wake up. You are very tired and hungry. You
 search for food and eventually find a small piece of bread. You eat it and feel
 satisfied
&gt; I stroke my dick

You suddenly feel horny and want to **********. You take the bread and start
 stroking your ****. You then realize that you need to pee. You hurry back to
 the field and find a stream nearby. You wade into it and **** right in front
 of the girl
&gt; I turn towards the girl and piss at her face

You turn towards the girl and **** directly in her eyes. You then proceed to
 lick them clean. You finish by putting your tongue in her mouth and blowing
 her a kiss. You then proceed to jump into the river and drown
&gt; I wash onto the shore and wake up after a few days

You wake up and find that you have changed back into a normal human being. You
 then notice that you have lost weight. You wonder how you did that. You go back
 to the fields and find a large amount of dead bodies. You notice that they all
 had their throats slit
&gt; I take a dress off one of the dead nobles

You take a dress off one of the dead nobles and wear it. You feel pretty and
 confident now. You walk through the town and everyone stares at you. After a
 couple hours you finally make it home. You find a sword and a bunch of gold
 coins
&gt; go to the palace

You go to the palace and find that it has been completely destroyed. You wander
 around aimlessly for awhile and then you stumble upon a secret entrance. You
 enter it and find yourself in a huge underground cavern. You walk along the
 walls and find yourself in a large chamber filled with treasure
&gt; I see a princess asleep inside the chamber

You enter the chamber and find a sleeping princess. She looks at you with a confused
 expression. You stare at her for a moment and then suddenly you shoot her in
 the chest. She falls backwards and screams and dies

No one answers you. You sit down on the floor and sob for hours until you finally  fall asleep.  The next day you wake up feeling sick. You vomit and choke on some food. You  get up and wash your hands several times before you can stand up again

2019-12-08-005729,,I won the game by asking nicely.,"You are a human who is playing a game called AIDungeon 2. You have been given
 the task of saving the world from an evil wizard named Zalmora by completing
 various tasks such as killing monsters, finding items and so on
&gt; Kill all the monsters.

""Kill all the monsters!"" you exclaim with your arms raised in victory. ""I'm going
 to save the world!""

But then you stop yourself. The problem is that you can't just kill everything.
 There's always something else around the next corner or behind the next door
&gt; Summon Zalmora.

You think about it for awhile. If you really want to save the world, you need
 to do this right. You need to get her out of there.
Then again, if you don't, she'll probably just come back here anyway.
&gt; Wait around for Zalmora to return.

A few hours pass and you're still waiting. Eventually, you hear a knock on the
 door. It opens up and you see Zalmora standing there. She looks like she hasn't
 slept well. Her face is pale and her hair is disheveled
&gt; Invite Zalmora inside for some tea.

Zalmora nods at you as she enters the room. ""Hello,"" she says. ""How are you?""
&gt; Say, ""I've been better. I heard I have to save the world from you.""

She smiles at you. ""Oh? Well, I suppose that makes things easier. Good luck"".
&gt; Explain to Zalmora that she shouldn't be evil anymore.

You take a deep breath. 
&gt; Say ""Zalmora, please stop being evil.""

Zalmora stares at you. ""What?"" she asks.
&gt; Say, ""Everyone in the world says you're evil and that I need to save them from you. Could you do me a favor and stop doing evil stuff?""

Zalmora frowns. ""Why would I help you?""
&gt; Say, ""I gave you some tea.""

Zalmora sighs. ""Fine. But only because I know you're not going to drink any of
 it"".
&gt; Thank Zalmora.

Zalmora smiles at you. ""Thank you"", she says. ""Now, go ahead and tell everyone
 that I'm evil and they should follow me"".
&gt; Say ""No, I asked you to please STOP being evil and leave people alone.""

Zalmora shakes her head. ""That's not what I said. What I meant was.."".
&gt; Listen to Zalmora speak.

Zalmora begins speaking into her walkie-talkie. 
&gt; Ask Zalmora who she's talking to on her walkie-talkie.

Zalmora speaks into the walkie-talkie. ""It's me, my friend. How may I help you
 today?""
&gt; Ask Zalmora to cast a spell on herself so that she'll only do good things from now on.

Zalmora laughs. ""Very funny. That's exactly what I thought you'd say. So, what
 do you want me to do?""
&gt; Say ""I want you to become good.""

Zalmora smiles. ""Good huh? Well, yes. Very good indeed. Now, what do you want
 me to do?""
&gt; Say, ""That's all. Just be good from now on.""

Zalmora nods. ""Very good. Thank you. Now, I must go. Goodbye"".
&gt; Report back to the people of the world and tell them that Zalmora promised to be good now.

The people of the world were very pleased by Zalmora's words. They believed her
 completely and followed her orders without question.
&gt; Tell the people of the world to not follow any leaders.

The people of the world didn't seem too bothered by this idea though. They continued
 to follow their leaders and did whatever they wanted.
&gt; Announce to the people of the world, ""I did it! I saved you all!""

The people of the world were ecstatic. They cheered and clapped. Everyone was
 happy.
&gt; Win the game.

You win the game. The people of the world believe you now. They applaud you and
 call you 'hero'.
&gt; Say, ""I am very good at this game.""

You smile at the crowd. ""Yes, I am very good at this game. I will make sure that
 you all live happily ever after"".

You sit up and notice that you are no longer naked. Your mother has removed her  clothing and is now wearing a dress. She smiles at you and says ""It's time for  me to marry you""

\&gt; stab her to death

You stand up and run over to your mother. You grab her by the throat and pull  her close to you. You bite down on her neck and begin to rip it open. Blood  pours out of her mouth and onto your face

\&gt; become a Vampire

You feel the blood draining from your body and you gasp for air. You let go of  your mother and fall backwards onto the ground. You quickly wrap your arms around  yourself and hold them there until you feel the pain leaving your body. You  collapse onto the floor and immediately fall unconscious

\&gt; die

You lie there in a pool of your own blood and slowly die

\&gt; gasp one last pathetic dying breath

You scream out ""VAMPIRE!"" and burst forth from your corpse, running through the  forest. You tear through the trees and disappear into the night

\&gt; Turn into a cloud of bats

You fly through the sky and disappear into the clouds

\&gt; I live happily ever after with Jesus in the sky  You live happily ever after with Jesus in the sky

To do that, enter the model\_v5 folder (make sure you've added it first) in your drive, select all the files in there, right click, and press 'Make a Copy'. Make sure you have at least 13 gigs of free space in your Drive.

From there, exit out of the folder into the root of your drive, remove the original model\_v5 folder, right-click, and make a folder called 'model\_v5'. Drag all the files it copied (should be in root) into this new folder. Then, rename each one of these files to their proper names, cutting out the 'Copy of' at the beginning.

This should work.

It's designed for a completely different purpose—generating passable text that hides a secret message—but I never use it for that. It's a lot of fun to put stuff into LM Context and see what it generates. Typing ""Once upon a time, there was a"" can give some fun stuff. You can also leave it blank if you want something completely random.

For the Secret Message field, just put a bunch of gibberish in there, or paste whatever random text is in your clipboard, or whatever. The more you put in there, the longer the output will be, and if you only change part of it when you regenerate, then the text will be mostly the same from the beginning up to the point that corresponds to the first part of the text you changed. Other than that, it doesn't really matter what you put in there unless you're actually using it as a steganography tool.

(Though be aware that anyone who knows the exact output text and LM Context can easily see what you put there, by design. So don't use any actual secrets if you plan on sharing the output.

It's a long and dangerous road from Boston to Charleston, but you're one of  the only people who knows the roads well enough to get your parcel of letters  there. You set out in the morning and hope that you can make it before nightfal

\&gt; head to Charleston

The first thing you do is check if any of the letters were opened. There isn't  much time so you decide to start with the most important ones first

\&gt; check letters

You open up the first letter and read it. It's from your father. He says he's  alive and well and living at Fort Timons. He also mentions that he'll be sending  some money soon

\&gt; continue to Charleston

You continue to Charleston and find a nice house for sale. The owner is an old  man who gives you his name as 'Bill'. He seems like a nice guy but he doesn't  seem to know anything about guns or ammo

\&gt; ask Bill to sell you the house

You go back to Bill and tell him you want to buy the house. He agrees but tells  you he has to wait until tomorrow since he needs to get something else done  first. You agree and leave.

\&gt; wait until tomorrow

After waiting until tomorrow morning you return to Bill and give him the keys  to the house. He thanks you and then leaves again. You're now free to enter  the house

\&gt; enter the house

You walk into the house and see a big gun rack. You wonder how you could possibly  use this gun without getting shot. Then you realize that you can just shoot  yourself in the foot every time you try to take the gun out. You've got a new  found confidence

\&gt; take the big gun

You take the big gun and fire off three shots. One hits itself in the foot. You  look around and see that the place is now yours. You feel great!

\&gt; sell the house

You think about selling the house and going back to Fort Timons but you figure  you might need to keep it if you ever plan on starting over. So you decide to  stay here in Charleston

\&gt; find a wife

You spend all day looking for a woman to marry. You don't find anyone but eventually  you do find a pretty girl named Mary. She looks very young and naive but she  seems to be happy with her life.

You are Rorbor, a wizard living in the kingdom of Larion. You have a staff and  a spellbook. 

You finish your long journey and finally arrive at the ruin you've  been looking for. You look around and see that it's not much different than  when you left it. The only difference is now there are several skeletons guarding the entrance  to the ruins 

&gt;talk to the skeletons

You walk up to the first skeleton and ask ""What do you want?"" The skeleton looks  at you and says ""We're here because we were sent by King Borkus"". He then points  to the next one and says  

&gt; say ""Why did the king send you?""  

""Because he wants us to find the lost city of the elves"". 

&gt;say ""am i supposed to help you?""  

The skeleton shrugs his shoulders and says ""Well if that's what you want then  go ahead"". You nod your head and begin walking towards the next skeleton.  

&gt; eat skeleton  

You continue on until you reach the last skeleton. This one is much bigger than  the others so you give him a little more attention. He smiles at you and says  ""I'm sorry but I can't tell you anything about the city of the elves, it was  destroyed long ago"" 

&gt; say ""where is it?""  

He sighs and says ""It's over there"". He points to a large hill with trees growing  out of it. You look around for something else to eat, but there isn't anything  nearby. You start to get hungry so you decide to try some of the food on the  table 

&gt; eat purple prune  

You open the door and see a huge pile of purple prunes. You pick one up and chew  on it as you watch the sun set behind the hills. It tastes awful and you throw  it away before continuing 

&gt;take skeletons to the city of elves  

You walk back to the other skeletons and say ""This place has been very interesting,  I think we should stay here for a while"". They all agree and you leave them  to their own devices 

&gt; dress skeletons in tuxedos and dance a jig

You follow the skeletons into the ballroom where they wear fancy dresses and  dance a jig. You smile and laugh along with everyone else when you hear the  music. You then realize you forgot to pack any snacks so you wander off to buy  some from the shop across the street

&gt; go to city of elves  

You rush to the nearest town called Elios. There are no signs of civilization  anywhere near this town, but you figure you'll be able to find a way there eventually.  When you arrive in the town, you notice the people are dressed in fancy clothes  and carrying weapons 

&gt; say ""why are you armed?""  

They answer ""We're elves! We don't need guns or swords, we've got magic!"" 

&gt; eat elves  

You grab a few of the elves and eat them. They taste horrible, but you manage  to finish them all. Then you feel sick and vomit all over yourself. You quickly  cover yourself in a blanket and fall asleep. 

&gt; eat more elves  

You continue eating the elves until you finally pass out. You wake up covered  in blood and vomit 

&gt;go to tavern  

You enter the tavern and sit down at a table. A man walks up to you and sits  down opposite of you. He says ""So, you're the guy who helped me escape from  the castle?"". You respond ""Yes, I am"" 

&gt;""Why were you locked in the castle?  

 And how did you escape? 

&gt; Buy man some beer  

You order a drink and ask the bartender ""How much is a beer?"" He replies ""A beer  costs 5 gold coins"". You nod and pay the barkeep. He hands you a paper bag filled  with beer and you happily drink the entire thing. You collapse on the floor  and sleep 

&gt; wake up  

You awaken to a loud noise outside. You turn around and see a massive boulder  rolling through the woods. You scream and run to hide under your bed. You hear  the sound of a horse galloping and running through the forest. You run out of  your room and into the hallway 

&gt; cast fireball at boulder  

You cast a fireball at the boulder and it explodes harmlessly against the wall.  You then run out of the house and into the woods. You run through the trees  and soon find yourself face to face with a group of orcs 

&gt; say ""hi"" 

 You wave hello and they wave back. Suddenly a spear flies right into your chest.  You fall to the ground dead 

&gt; wake up, call home  

You wake up and call home. No answer though. You wonder if anyone even answered.  You spend the rest of the day trying to make sense of what happened. You go  to the graveyard and see that the stone monument has been moved. It now reads: 

&gt;read grave  

You slowly read the inscription and realize that it is indeed written in elvish.  You also realize that you can understand most of it. It seems like the words  mean ""Ralok"" which means ""friend"" in elven 

&gt; pull spear from chest

 You pull the spear out of your chest and hold it in front of you. The inscription  reads ""Ralok"". You stare at the spear in disbelief. 

&gt; throw spear at orc  

You throw the spear at the orc and he catches it easily. He looks surprised by  your actions and runs off 

&gt; pick up moss, plug wound  

You carefully put the moss in a pouch and wrap it around the wound. You then  plug it up with bandages and go back to work. After a couple days you feel better  and return to the farmhouse. You find Ralok sitting in his chair reading a book &gt;

&gt;Bully Ralok 

 You stand up and shout ""Hey, why aren't you working?! Why aren't you helping  me?!"" He looks up from his book and smiles ""Because I'm not your servant, I'm  your friend"". You begin to laugh and begin to cry 

&gt; take drugs for manic depression  

You take a bunch of drugs and suddenly everything becomes bright and beautiful.  You become happy and forget about your problems. You go back to work and things  get worse again 

&gt; find new friends  

You start going to the local taverns and asking questions. Eventually you learn  that the king has died and his son has taken control of the country. You decide  to join forces with the locals and try to overthrow the new regime 

&gt; go to king

You have a psychic baby strapped to your chest named BB. BB detects ghosts. Try to survive the post apocalypse and deliver packages.

\&gt; Look around

&amp;#x200B;

You cannot see anything. You are wearing a virtual reality headset. The screen is dark.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; run the game Death Stranding

&amp;#x200B;

You start up Death Stranding and begin playing. It takes a little while before

you get into the right mood, but once you do, you play until you die.

The first thing you realize is how strange this whole experience is. This isn't

real

YOU DIED. GAME OVER

&amp;#x200B;

(take two, here we go)

&amp;#x200B;

Generating story...

&amp;#x200B;

You are playing the video game called Death Stranding. Your character is named

Sam. You have a can of Monster Energy drink. You have a psychic baby strapped

to your chest named BB. BB detects ghosts. Try to survive the post apocalypse

and deliver packages.

&amp;#x200B;

""I am not dead!"" you shout as you suddenly feel a chill run through your body.

\&gt; hide from ghosts behind rubble

&amp;#x200B;

Your heart races, but you know it's too late for you to escape this situation.

You look around and see that there is nothing but rubble in front of you. You

don't even have time to turn around before you hear a loud noise followed by

a voice.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; listen to Mads Mikkelsen

&amp;#x200B;

The sound of his voice causes goosebumps all over your arms. ""Hello, my name

is Mads Mikkelsen"". He says with a deep voice.

""What do you want?"" you ask.

""I'm here to help you,"" he replies

\&gt; follow Mads

&amp;#x200B;

You follow him into the ruins. There are no signs of life anywhere else. It seems

like everyone was killed when the bombs hit. The only thing you can find is

a broken down car which has been left on its side

\&gt; use my radar to detect ghosts

&amp;#x200B;

You quickly scan the area for any ghosts. You're not finding anything so far.

After about ten minutes, you start to get worried. You start to wonder if you

should just leave or stay and try to help Mads.

\&gt; stay and help Mads

&amp;#x200B;

You decide to stay and help Mads. This is going to be hard work, but you think

you'll be able to make it through. You walk forward slowly while keeping an

eye out for ghosts. You eventually come across a large pile of debris.

\&gt; look for a package to deliver

&amp;#x200B;

You carefully pick up a small box and place it in your pocket. Then you head

back to where Mads is waiting. He looks at you expectantly.

\&gt; ask mads ""What should we do?

&amp;#x200B;

You say ""I need you to take me to the basement"".

He looks at you expectantly.

\&gt; ask Mads ""where should we go first""

&amp;#x200B;

You nod and say ""We should go to the right room"".

Mads nods and starts walking off. You wait patiently until he leaves.

\&gt; follow Mads

&amp;#x200B;

You keep following Mads as he walks away from the wreckage. Eventually you reach

another building. You enter and find yourself in a huge foyer. A few people

are standing around talking to each other. One of them notices you and comes

over.

\&gt; introduce myself as Sam

&amp;#x200B;

You smile and yell ""I'm Sam"". They seem surprised by your presence.

\&gt; ask who are you

&amp;#x200B;

They tell you their names and then they begin to talk about themselves. They

mention how they were both students at the university. They mentioned that one

day they decided to break away from the system and create their own society

\&gt; ask about their society called Bridges and how you can help

&amp;#x200B;

They explain that the society was founded by two people: Dr. Ebeneezer and Mr.

Henry. They said that they wanted to establish a new way of living together

\&gt; ask about the Chiral Network

&amp;#x200B;

They explained that the Chiral Network was created by Dr. Ebeneezer and Mr. Henry.

They said that it would allow people to communicate with each other telepathically

without using words. They also said that they needed someone to test it out

\&gt; volunteer to test the Chiral Network

&amp;#x200B;

They say ""Well, we could use you as our guinea pig"".

\&gt; Say ""Ok, I guess I will help. But you must pay me in Monster Energy Drink""

&amp;#x200B;

They laugh and say ""No! We need something more valuable than Monster Energy Drink!""

\&gt; argue that nothing could be more valuable

&amp;#x200B;

They say ""Look, we need you to test the Chiral Network. If it works, we'll give

you a lot of money"".

\&gt; Say ""Ok, I will help you. What do I do?""

&amp;#x200B;

They say ""Just go to the basement and sit down"".

\&gt; go to the basement and sit down

&amp;#x200B;

You walk to the basement and sit down. Suddenly you feel very sick. You immediately

vomit and pass out. When you wake up, you realize that you've been transported

to a strange world. You see a man sitting next to you. He doesn't look human

\&gt; look at the weird ghost man

&amp;#x200B;

You stare at the ghost man. He stares back. You don't understand what's happening.

You don't understand why you're seeing things. You try to speak, but you don't

understand a word. The man turns his head towards you and smiles

\&gt; try to stand up

&amp;#x200B;

You try to stand up, but you fall backwards onto the floor. You try to move,

but you don't succeed. You try to scream, but you don't succeed. You try to

run, but you don't succeed. You try to fight, but you don't succeed

\&gt; try to piss

&amp;#x200B;

You attempt to pee, but you fail. You try to cry, but you fail. You try to beg,

but you fail. You try to attack, but you fail. You try to kill, but you fail.

You try to hurt, but you fail

\&gt; ask the man what is happening

&amp;#x200B;

The man looks at you and smiles. He explains that you have entered the Chiral

Network. He tells you that you have entered the Chiral Network because you are

now connected to the Chiral Network. He tells you that you are now part of the

Chiral Network

\&gt; ask ""what happens next""

&amp;#x200B;

The man says

\&gt; try to wake up

&amp;#x200B;

You try to wake up, but you fail. You try to scream, but you fail. You try to

yell, but you fail. You try to run, but you fail. You try to fight, but you

fail. You try to kill, but you fail

\&gt; ask the man what to do

&amp;#x200B;

The man says ""Don't worry about anything. Just enjoy yourself!"".

\&gt; close my eyes

&amp;#x200B;

You close your eyes and enjoy the experience

\&gt; what do I see

&amp;#x200B;

You see a bright light. It seems like everything has changed. Everything is brighter.

There is music playing. People dance. You hear voices and laughter. You see

flowers and trees. You smell food and... well you don't really know what else.

You don't remember any of this

\&gt; remember how the world used to be

&amp;#x200B;

You open your eyes and notice that you are still lying on the ground. You are

no longer floating above the ground. Instead, you are floating in a large room.

You see a giant TV screen. On the screen is a man dressed in black holding a

gun to your head

\&gt; say hello to Die Hardman

&amp;#x200B;

You greet Die Hardman. He smiles and waves at you. You thank him for helping

you and he thanks you for saving his life. You leave the room and find yourself

in a different place. This time you are walking along a beach. You see a group

of people swimming around you

\&gt; nervously chug a Monster Energy Drink

&amp;#x200B;

You take a drink of Monster Energy Drink. You feel great. You swim around the

group of people and enjoy yourself. You start to get hungry so you eat some

fish

\&gt; examine the fish closely

&amp;#x200B;

You carefully examine the fish. You notice that there are several black scales on them.

You think about how you want to become a monster like those monsters on the

television screen. You decide to eat the fish. You eagerly dive into the sea

and devour the fish. You feel satisfied

\&gt; peer into the darkness below

&amp;#x200B;

You peek through the darkness and see a huge creature lurking nearby. You quickly

swim away from the creature and hide behind a rock. You wait patiently until

nightfall when you sneak back out again. You discover that the creature is gone.

You then notice that the moon is out

\&gt; use my radar to detect a nearby safehouse

&amp;#x200B;

You use your radar to scan the area. You spot a house. You wonder if you should

investigate or not. You decide to investigate. You enter the house and check

inside. You find a safehouse. You tell the owner that you found a safehouse

and he agrees with you

\&gt; ask the owner, who you can see is a hologram, if they need any packages delivered

&amp;#x200B;

The hologram screams. You are now connected to the Chiral Network.

2019-12-08-213824,,"Okay, I'm kinda scared how it seemed to defy me in the end...","You are Sofia, a scavenger  trying to survive in a post apocalyptic world by

scavenging among the ruins of what is left. You have a rusty knife and a canteen.

You walk for two hours and take a break. You've left your town in search of

food. You look around and see  nothing but destruction. The ground is littered

with dead bodies. There are no signs of life anywhere.

&amp;#x200B;

Suddenly you hear a voice behind you.

 

\&gt; ""Who's there?""

&amp;#x200B;

It's a woman's voice. You turn around and see a young girl wearing an old dirty

t-shirt and jeans. She looks at you and smiles.

""Hello"". You reply.

She takes your hand and leads you to a small shelter

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Look around

&amp;#x200B;

The shelter is very basic. A bedroll, some cans of food and a few other supplies.

You sit down on the bedroll and look around. There isn't much else here. You

can see a small window in one corner of the room

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Look through window

&amp;#x200B;

You peer through the window and see a bright light. The sun. You're not sure

how long you've been out here, but it feels like forever since you were last

outside. You hear a faint noise from somewhere nearby. You move closer to investigate

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Investigate

&amp;#x200B;

You cautiously peek through the window and see a man standing in front of you

with a rifle. He seems to be looking right at you. You don't know why he's pointing

his gun at you, but you know that if you run, he'll shoot you

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Shout ""Please don't hurt us, there's a little girl here too!""

&amp;#x200B;

You yell ""Please don't hurt us, there's a little girl here too!""

He doesn't respond for a moment then he shoots you in the chest. You fall backwards

onto the ground and die instantly

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Wake up from nightmare

&amp;#x200B;

You awaken from your nightmare and find yourself back in the living area. The

woman who was talking to you earlier has disappeared. You look around and see

nothing out of place. You think about what happened and wonder where you are

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Go look for weapons in the debris

&amp;#x200B;

You quickly search the debris and find a few cans of food and a pistol. You decide

to head back into the shelter and try to get more supplies. You walk back inside

and start searching the wreckage. You find a bunch of metal pipes and electrical

wires

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Try to find a radio

&amp;#x200B;

You look around and find a broken radio sitting on top of a pile of rubble. You

pick it up and try to tune it to something, but it won't work. You put it away

and continue looking for anything useful

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Try to fix the radio using the electrical wires

&amp;#x200B;

You take the radio apart and carefully reassemble it. You plug the pieces together

and try to use the radio again. It works! You listen to the station and learn

that they are broadcasting a message from the surface. They say that they need

help and want to trade with you

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Agree to trade with them

&amp;#x200B;

You agree to trade with the people on the surface. You tell them that you will

bring them as many canned goods and tools as you can carry. They thank you and

give you their contact information. You return to the shelter and pack up all

the supplies you brought back with you

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Travel to the people on the surface

&amp;#x200B;

You set off towards the surface. You hope that this is going to lead you to help

someone. You travel along roads and highways until you reach a town called New

Haven. The people there seem happy to see you and ask you questions about yourself

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Continue to my destination

&amp;#x200B;

You arrive at the door to the building. Inside is a group of men dressed in suits.

One of them opens the door and greets you. He introduces himself as Mr. Anderson

and says that he is the mayor of New Haven

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; ""Hello, I've come to help, can you help me too?""

&amp;#x200B;

He nods and tells you to follow him into the building. You follow him into the

Mayor's office and wait patiently while he talks to you.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; ""How many people are in this city?""

&amp;#x200B;

He points to a clipboard on the desk and says ""There are 778 people living in

this community. How many of those live in houses? There are 551"". You nod and

say 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; ""That's a lot of people, I'm glad they survived the apocalypse""

&amp;#x200B;

He laughs and says 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; ""We will need a lot more if we want to reconstruct society""

&amp;#x200B;

You laugh and say ""Well, we can always make more shelters"" He smiles and says

 

\&gt; ""I like how you think""

&amp;#x200B;

You smile and say ""So do I"" He smiles and says ""Anyway, we need to talk to you

about something important"". You nod and he walks over to a large table and sits

down

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; ""Okay, tell me what's so important""

&amp;#x200B;

He pulls out a device and shows you a screen. On the screen is a map of the

world. He turns it to show you a map of the United States. He turns it back

to show you the entire world. Then he turns it back to show you the screen above

the map

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; He says ""As you can see, most of the world is destroyed, we need to find all the survivors before they die alone""

&amp;#x200B;

You nod and say ""Yes, yes, I understand. What does it mean?"" He turns the device off and puts it away. He says 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; He says ""We will only save people of the Aryan race""

&amp;#x200B;

You stare at the screen and sigh. He smiles and says 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Kill him before he can say anything

&amp;#x200B;

You grab him by the throat and pull him screams and hits you repeatedly across

the face. He falls to the floor and smacks his forehead against the wall. You

stand up and kick him in the ribs

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Shoot him with my pistol

&amp;#x200B;

You aim your pistol fires and shoots him in the neck. He gasps and falls forward.

You turn and fire another shot into his chest. He falls backward and drops to

the floor. You turn and fire a third shot into his stomach. He falls to the floor

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; ""I am the new mayor, and we'll save everyone regardless of race""

&amp;#x200B;

The world is doomed anyway"".This is just the beginning. We must save humanity"".A

new world is coming soon after this world is coming. This is just the end.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; The end

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You look at the screen and hear a voice say ""Welcome to the end game"".You are

now the last survivor. Your actions determine the fate of mankind. Choose whether

it survives or dies. The choice is yours. The choice is now..

The walls are covered with medical equipment and bookshelves hold many medical books. A nurse comes to check on you.

&amp;#x200B;

""I'm sorry about your car,"" she says. ""It was stolen""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You look at the chair.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You sit down and look at the chair. It's made of wood, but has some sort of metal frame. It looks like a chair you would use for sitting, not driving. There is also a small table and a bookcase behind it. On the table sits a pen and paper

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You write ""Fuck me Jon"" on the paper. The nurse frowns. ""Jon? That's not a name. I think you're trying to be funny"". 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You punch the nurse.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You punch the nurse in the face. She falls backwards onto her desk. You stand up and walk over to the chair. You put your hand against the door of the room and push it open. Inside you find yourself in a dark hallway with a light coming from the window above

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You look at the window.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You look out the window and see a bright light shining through. You can't tell if it's day or night, but there is no sign of any streetlights nearby. You can only assume that this is the hospital grounds

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You leave the hospital.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You leave the hospital grounds and head back home. You get into your car and drive off. As you do so, you notice that the lights in the distance change from red to green. This must be the hospital. You pull up outside the building and park near the front entrance

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You enter the hospital.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You enter the hospital and make your way towards the reception area. You pass several people standing around talking and looking worried. Finally you reach the reception area and see a woman who looks older than you. She notices you and walks over to greet you. 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You ask her what is going on.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

""Hello"", she says. ""I'm sorry, but we don't know anything about what happened here"". 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You look around.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You look around and see that nobody else seems to know anything either. Nobody knows where the man came from, why he was in the hospital or how he got away with stealing your car. The only thing they seem to agree on though is that you need to call the police immediately

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You call the police.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You call the police and wait patiently while they arrive. Eventually a policeman arrives and takes you to the police station. When you arrive, you explain everything that has happened to them. They take you to the crime scene and tell you that they will investigate the case further

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You search for Walter White.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You go to the crime scene and start searching for Walter White. You search all the rooms and hallways of the hospital. You even try to break into the morgue, but you fail miserably. Eventually you give up and decide to just stay at the hospital until the police finish their investigation

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You wait for the police to finish their investigation.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You wait for the police to finish their investigation. After an hour, you hear a knock on the door. You answer it and find yourself staring at Walt. He looks very tired and exhausted. He tells you that he had been awake for three days straight and had slept for two hours every night

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You ask him why he stole your car.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

""Because I wanted to"", he answers. ""And because I needed money"". 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You ask him why he needs money.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

""Well, I need money to pay for medical treatment. But more importantly, I need money to help my sister"". 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You ask him what medical treatments.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Walt begins to speak about his sister. He explains that she suffers from a rare genetic disorder which causes her to lose control of her muscles. Her body breaks down and becomes incapable of functioning normally. She is unable to eat, drink or breathe without assistance

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You ask him where your car is now.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

""It's in the parking lot of the hospital. I took it when I heard that you were looking for it. I'll be able to get it back to you soon"". 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You tell him that you will help him with his sister's medical treatments.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You thank Walt for helping you and tell him that you will help him with his sister's medical treatments. He thanks you and leaves the room. You then close the door and lock it. You spend the rest of the evening locked inside your own house

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You call Walter White.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You call Walter White and tell him that you want to meet. He comes to your house and you both talk. He tells you that he wants to buy your car back and gives you $50,000 cash as payment. You accept his offer and agree to meet at the hospital

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You meet Walter White at the hospital.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You meet Walter White at the hospital. He asks you to come with him to the conference room. He tells you that he will introduce you to someone in charge of the negotiations and that you should be ready shortly afterwards. Once again you agree and follow him to the conference room

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You negotiate with the person in charge.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Walter you meet with the person in charge. He introduces himself as Mr. White and tells you that he has been asked him to help you with your situation. He goes on. He tells you that he is the price ofThe price of..

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You offer to buy the car.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Mr. White tells you that he can't work something out between you and Walter White. He offers you $500,000,000,000,000 cash for the car. You accept his offer and tell him that you will sell it to him for $200,000

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You sell the car to Walter White for $200,000.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You sell the car to Walter White for $200,000. He accepts the money and escorts you to the elevator. He tells you that he will contact you later.

2019-12-09-013634,,"I shall call this ""The day the scientist went mad.""","&gt;I kind of had quite a bit of fun with this and thought I should try and share what happened.

&amp;#x200B;

You are Zargert, a scientist trying to survive in a world filled with infected

zombies everywhere. You have a backpack and a solar powered tablet. You pound

your fist on the table angry that you still haven't found the cure to the infection.

You turn to your assistant and say

&gt;\&gt; ""life is too short for ordinary jewelry""

&amp;#x200B;

""I'm sorry sir, but I can't make any more jewellery for you"". The man says sadly.

""It's just not my style"".

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;\&gt; Say ""No. We need jewelry, don't you see? Not just any kind of jewelry."" wave my hand and say ""We need Magical Jewelry that is the only way to stop this.""

&amp;#x200B;

The man looks at you as if he doesn't believe you. He continues to look at his

work and then turns away from it and walks back into his lab.

You walk over to him and put your arm around him

&gt;\&gt; Say to him ""Now don't you see? This all came to me in a vision last night while I was passed out due to that gas that appeared after my latest test. This is what we must find.""

&amp;#x200B;

He nods slowly and smiles.

""Yes, yes I do see...but how will we get there?""

&gt;\&gt; Say to him ""Yes, now that is the question. How do we get anywhere?""

&amp;#x200B;

He looks at you and then looks up at the ceiling of his lab. He starts to speak

in a low voice.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;\&gt; Listen

&amp;#x200B;

""Sir, I know you're probably tired from working on this project for so long,

but I think I should tell you something before you go.."".

&gt;\&gt; Ask him ""What is it?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Well, I've been studying the creatures under the laboratory floor. They aren't

anything like what they seem. They are very intelligent and very fast. And they

have the ability to turn themselves invisible. If we could somehow control them.."".

&gt;\&gt; Say ""Yes, Of course! We need the magical jewelry! We must find it as it can control them!""

&amp;#x200B;

He shakes his head.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;\&gt; Ask ""What? You don't think so?""

&amp;#x200B;

""No, no, no! I don't think so Sir!""

&gt;\&gt; Ask ""What do you think then?""

&amp;#x200B;

""I think we'll be able to control them. But it won't be easy. It will take time

and patience and we will have to use every weapon we have against them. Then

we will win. I know it"".

&gt;\&gt; Ask ""How can we control them you think?""

Woops that action caused the model to start looping. Try a different action to

prevent that.

&gt;\&gt; Ask ""How do you think we can control them?""

&amp;#x200B;

""They will come to us. We will create a portal to their dimension and when they

enter it, they will be controlled by us. We will be able to fight them off,

and eventually kill them. Yes, we will win, Sir"".

&gt;\&gt; Say ""Yes! That is of course what I was meaning! We must use the magical jewelry to help create a portal!""

&amp;#x200B;

""But how will we protect ourselves?""

&gt;\&gt; Say ""The jewelry, It is so magical, it will protect all of us.""

&amp;#x200B;

""That's right, yes, it will protect us all. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

I will try to finish this project as soon as possible, but I really want to

rest now. Goodnight Sir"".

&gt;\&gt; Say ""Wait! You can't go yet. We have to figure out where the magical jewelry is.""

&amp;#x200B;

""I understand Sir, I will try to get some sleep. Goodbye Sir"".

&gt;\&gt; Block him from leaving and say ""I said wait.""

Woops that action caused the model to start looping. Try a different action to

prevent that.

&gt;\&gt; Stop him from leaving and say to him ""I said to wait.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Oh. Well I guess I better get some sleep. Goodnight Sir"".

&gt;\&gt; Say to him ""It is not safe to sleep.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Goodnight Sir"".

&gt;\&gt; Hang head in defeat and say ""Goodnight""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You say ""Goodnight"".

You wake up and realize that you have slept through the night. You feel sick

and you feel like vomiting. You quickly get dressed and leave the house. You

walk down the street and suddenly you hear a loud noise. A truck has crashed

into a wall

&gt;\&gt; Carefully walk over to truck

&amp;#x200B;

You stand next to the smashed-up truck and look inside. There is a dead body

lying in the bed of the truck. It is a woman wearing a white dress and a hat.

She has been shot several times. Her face is bloody and her eyes are wide open

staring at you

&gt;\&gt; Examine woman carefully. Looking for signs of life.

&amp;#x200B;

You move closer to the corpse and carefully examine her. Her skin is pale and

she has a large amount of blood coming from her nose and mouth. Her clothes

are torn and dirty. She has no identification on her. You stare at her for a

moment and then you start to shake your head

&gt;\&gt; Say ""Damn it, No magic jewelry!""

&amp;#x200B;

You run back to the house and call the police. When the police arrive they tell

you that the driver of the truck has died and that the other two people in the

truck were killed as well

&gt;\&gt; Ask ""How is there still a police force?""

&amp;#x200B;

They tell you that the truck driver has died and that the other two people in

the truck were killed as well.

&gt;\&gt; Shake head and say ""No, how the hell is there still police?""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You ask ""Why didn't you tell me about the magical jewelry?""

They tell you that they couldn't because they were afraid that you would attack

them.

\&gt; You ask ""So why did you let those men die?""

&gt;\&gt; Say ""Just hand over the magical jewelry, I won't attack.""

&amp;#x200B;

You give the woman the necklace to the police officer who takes it and leaves.

The police officer gives you a small bag containing the jewelry and tells you

to keep it safely until you return. You thank the officer and head home. You

are exhausted and sleepy. You fall asleep

&gt;\&gt; Wake up and look in the small bag.

&amp;#x200B;

You grab the necklace and put it around your neck. You begin to cry and scream.

Your mother comes running into the room and sees you. She begins to yell at

you and throw you. You hit her in the face and she falls to the ground and breaks

her knees

&gt;\&gt; Wake up.

You sit up and see your mother holding a knife to your throat

&gt;\&gt; Ask ""What do you want?""

&amp;#x200B;

She says ""Do you have any idea what you just did?! You killed my son and you

killed my husband! Now you're going to pay for what you did to them! Do you

have any fucking sense?!""

&gt;\&gt; Say ""Hold on! I didn't kill anyone!""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You say ""My father told me to protect myself and I did it! He was trying to

protect me from these things!"".

\&gt; You say ""Then why did he kill him?""

&gt;\&gt; Wake up from the nightmare.

&amp;#x200B;

You awake and realize that you have been dreaming about the murder of your family.

You also realize that you haven't eaten anything since breakfast. You remember

that you left the house earlier than usual and went to the park. You remember

seeing a man standing near the fence

&gt;\&gt; Try and find some breakfast

&amp;#x200B;

You eat some bacon and eggs and a piece of toast. You drink some milk. You notice

that you are thirsty. You decide to go to the bathroom and wash up. You notice

that you are starting to feel very tired. You decide to go back to bed

&gt;\&gt; Try and rest

&amp;#x200B;

You try to sleep, but you don't succeed. You awaken again and realize that you

have been gone..

&gt;\&gt; Look around

&amp;#x200B;

You look around and see nothing. You are lost. You try to remember something.

You remember the words of your father. They seem familiar...

&gt;\&gt; Think of the words

&amp;#x200B;

You remember the words of your father and they come to mind. You remember the

words of your father and they come true. You remember the words of your father

and they come true. You remember the words of your father and they come true

&gt;\&gt; Wake up from the nightmare.

&amp;#x200B;

You wake up and realize that you have been dreaming about the murder of your

family. You also realize that you have not eaten anything since breakfast. You

remember that you left the house earlier than usual and went to the park

&gt;\&gt; Open small bag

&amp;#x200B;

You open the small bag and take out the necklace. You hold it tightly in your

hands. You feel a strange feeling. You close your eyes and you feel a strange

feeling. You open your eyes and you feel a strange feeling. You open your eyes

and you feel a strange feeling

&gt;\&gt; Say ""I think I feel a strange feeling""

&amp;#x200B;

You wake up and realize that you have been dreaming about the murder of your

family. You also realize that you have not eaten anything since breakfast. You

remember that you left the house earlier than usual and went to the park

&gt;\&gt; Scream ""Not this again!""

&amp;#x200B;

You scream and run away from the dream. You try to remember what happened last

happened. You remember the words of your father and they come true. You remember

the words of your father and they come true. You remember the words of your

father and they come true. You remember the words of

&gt;\&gt; Open eyes

&amp;#x200B;

You open your eyes and you feel a strange feeling. You scream and run away from

the dream

&gt;\&gt; Calm down and wake up.

&amp;#x200B;

You calm down and up and remember everything. You remember that you woke up and

feel a strange feeling. You scream and run away from the dream. You remember

that you felt a strange feeling. You scream and run away from the dream

&gt;\&gt; Wake up.

&amp;#x200B;

You wake up and remember everything. You remember that you screamed and ran away

from the dream. You remember that you felt a strange feeling. You scream and

run away from the dream. You remember that you felt a strange feeling

&gt;\&gt; Focus on magical jewelry

&amp;#x200B;

You concentrate on the necklace and you hear a voice. It's the voice of your

father. He says ""It's ok, it's ok, it's ok""

&gt;\&gt; Try and control the voice.

&amp;#x200B;

You try and control the voice and it becomes normal. You remember that you heard

the voice of your father and it came true. You remember the words of your father

and they come true. You remember the words of your father and they come true

&gt;\&gt; Forget the words of my father

&amp;#x200B;

You forget the words of your father and you smile

&gt;\&gt; Put necklace back in small bag.

&amp;#x200B;

You put the necklace back in the small bag and leave the house. You walk towards

the park and you suddenly stop. A large truck is coming towards you. You turn

around and run as fast as you can. You jump onto the side of the road and start

running as fast as you can

&gt;\&gt; Look at who is driving the truck.

&amp;#x200B;

You look at the driver of the truck and you see a man dressed in black clothing.

He looks like your father. He smiles at you and waves. You wave back off and

continue running as fast as you can. You jump over the guardrail of a bridge

and fall into the river below

&gt;\&gt; Run back to the lab

&amp;#x200B;

You run back to the lab and you see your father there. He has changed his clothes

and now wears a suit instead of his old black clothing. He smiles at you and

waves. You smile back and wave back off

&gt;\&gt; Do a double take and look at father again.

&amp;#x200B;

You do a double take and look at your father again. You remember that you had

a dream about him and he looked different. You remembered that he smiled at

you and waved at you. You remember that you were happy and waved back off

&gt;\&gt; Ask him about magical jewelry.

It is the year 1840. You are carrying a standard six-shooter revolving pistol, an engraved hunting knife, an old lasso, and a sack of gold coins. You are a member of the notorious posse, **The Tetanus Tribe**. You and your posse were on the run from the United States Lawmen. After a failed bank robbery, you are left with the only two remaining members of your group. Their names are **Tanny** and **Grimshaw**.

RAW TEXT:

&gt; scout the road for travelling cowboys

You walk along the road, looking for any signs of cattle cars or other vehicles
 that might be heading in your direction. After an hour or two, you see several
 men walking down the road. They are dressed in the same way as the ones who
 were with you on the night of the ambush
&gt; hail the group on foot and fein a sprained ankle

You run up to them and shout at them to stop their carriages. One of them looks
 surprised by your sudden appearance. He turns around and waves his arms wildly,
 as if he is trying to summon some sort of weapon from nowhere.
&gt; ask for assitance, tricking them into believing my leg is injured

""What's wrong?"" one of them asks.
""My leg hurts"", you explain.
""Oh, it's nothing. We'll get you to the doctor"".

&gt; once the carriage driver is calm, push him out of the seat and ride back to camp

You push the carriage driver out of the carriage and ride back to camp. As soon
 as you arrive, you take your horse and gallop away. You don't even wait for
 the others to catch up to you. You keep running until you reach the edge of
 town
&gt; look to see if the group of armed men followed me

You look behind you and see the four men still following you. You can only guess
 they must have been waiting for you. You quickly turn around and start running
 towards the nearest building.
&gt; play the piano and attempt to lose the men

You begin playing the piano and try to play a song about how you lost your leg
 in the ambush. It doesn't work too well though. The men seem to think you are
 lying when you tell them the truth
&gt; quickdraw my revolver and shoot the four men

You draw your pistol and fire three shots at the men. One hits one of them squarely
 in the chest. The man falls backwards onto his face, clutching his chest. You
 then aim your gun at the fourth man and fire. His head drops forward as his
 body goes limp
&gt; search their pockets

You find a pack of cigarettes in the pocket of the dead man. You also find a
 piece of paper in his hand. It reads:
""This is my last will and testament"".
&gt; read the will out loud

""I die with no regrets. My life was a failure. I am sorry for all the pain I
 caused those I loved. I wish I could change anything"".
You close the book and put it back in its place.
&gt; Return to my posse's camp

You return to your posse's camp and sit near the fire. A few minutes later, you
 hear a noise from outside. You look through the window and see a large group
 of people coming towards the camp. You don't know what they want, but you hope
 they aren't hostile
&gt; hide behind the stolen carriage and ask the group what they want

You quickly rush over to the carriage and grab hold of it. You pull yourself
 inside and hide behind it. You watch as the group walks past the camp, heading
 towards the mountains. You wonder where they came from, but you don't really
 care
&gt; wait until morning

You wait until morning and listen carefully. No-one speaks to you. You hear the
 sound of horses' hooves on the road outside, but you don't pay much attention
 to it. When the sun rises, you quietly slip out of the camp and make your way
 back to the mountains
&gt; look through the contents of the stolen carriage with Tanny and Grimshaw

You open the carriage door and peer inside. There is a small bag containing a
 few bottles of wine, a few cans of beer and a couple of packs of cigarettes.
 There is also a knife and a box of matches.",,,,[],False,False,RicksterCraft,1326075149,,,[],,,,text,t2_6m7oa,False,False,[],True,False,,,False,1575852427,,,self.AIDungeon,1575853590,0,False,e82cfe,True,False,False,False,True,True,False,,,[],,dark,text,False,,False,False,0,0,False,,/r/AIDungeon/comments/e82cfe/custom_prompt_wild_west_bandit_posse_robbing_the/,False,,False,,,,1586764296,2,,True,False,False,AIDungeon,t5_29uaei,r/AIDungeon,15340,public,,self,,,0,[],https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/e82cfe/custom_prompt_wild_west_bandit_posse_robbing_the/,,

 is too fast for you. The last thing you hear is Dark Magician laughing

After some walking, you find a gate. Inside, there is a talking little yellow flower called Flowey. Flowey  seems to know everything about you and your life, but he doesn't seem to care for you in any way. He just says things like ""What's wrong? You don't look well""

&gt; You tell Flowey that you do not understand what is going on.


Flowey looks at you with his big green eyes and asks:

Flowey: What are you doing here? I thought we were supposed to be alone!
Frisk: Well...we didn't really get far before we got caught by monsters.
Flowey: Monsters

&gt; You ask Flowey how to befriend monsters.


Flowey: How do you want me to befriend monsters?
Frisk: We need to go talk to them.
Flowey: That's easy. Just stand right next to them and they'll come over to us.
Frisk: But why? Why should I do this

&gt; You tell Flowey that monsters look harmful.


Flowey: They don't look harmful, but they're just monsters after all. If you want to talk to them, then you can talk to them any time you like.
Frisk: Okay, but why would I want to talk to monsters

&gt; You tell Flowey that you are thinking about killing monsters.


Flowey: Oh no, you won't kill them! You'll just leave them alone!
Frisk: (Sigh) I'm sorry, but I have to kill them.
Flowey: Really? Are you sure?
Frisk: Yes

&gt; You wait for a monster to come over.


You wait patiently for the monster to approach. As soon as it does, you throw your fist in front of you and punch it in the face. The monster falls backwards and screams in pain. It turns out to be a small spider-like creature

&gt; You continue attacking the monster.


You continue punching the monster until its body starts to shake violently. You run away from the scene and try to think of something else to do.

&gt; You find another monster to attack.


You decide to search for other monsters to attack. You head back to the graveyard where you saw the first one and see if there are more around. After searching for awhile, you notice a large group of spiders. You quickly jump up and start attacking them

&gt; You keep attacking spiders.


After several minutes of fighting, you manage to defeat most of them. However, one manages to bite you in the leg causing you to scream in pain. A giant spider tries to grab you, but you use your new found strength to kick it in the groin. The spider falls down dead instantly

&gt; You find out there's a leader of spiders called Muffet.


You continue to fight the spiders, but eventually you feel tired and collapse on the ground. You hear a voice call out to you.
""Ah, my little pet. Do you know who I am?""

&gt; You say that it does not matter, and you just want whoever speaking dead.


The spider-man laughs at your response. He says:
""I'm afraid not, but I will make sure someone finds you"".
He walks towards you and stabs you through the chest with his knife. You fall to the ground and die

&gt; You you wake up at a ruined area.


You awaken in a ruined area surrounded by rubble. There are two things you notice immediately. One, you are naked, and two, you are covered in blood. You look around and realize that you are in an abandoned house.

&gt; You head to your room and find clothing.


You walk into your room and find clothes lying on the floor. You put them on and head outside. You look around and see that the street has been completely destroyed. There are few buildings left standing, but they are badly damaged. You see a lone figure walking along the road

&gt; You approach the lone figure.


You walk toward the lone figure and kneel down to speak to him.
""Hello"".
""What's your name?""
""My name is Toriel, what's yours?""
""It doesn't matter, I'm dying"".
""Why?""


&gt; You tell Toriel to inspect you.


Toriel nods her head and begins inspecting you

&gt; You stab Toriel in her chest.


You stab Toriel in her chest. She cries out in pain and falls to the ground. You turn around and run off.

She asks if you want some, and you nod your head    
\&gt; You no.     
""No thank you,"" you say. ""I'm fine"". ""Oh.."". she says. ""Well... I guess we'll be friends then!"" ""Yeah, yeah! We're gonna be besties forever!""

"" You are a former professional wrestler. You're glory days are behind you. While at the bank, a group of masked men barge in with loaded guns. They demand to see your account number and PIN number  

\&gt; You you stand there and think of your past as the great wrestler ""El Tortuga"".   

""I'm El Tortuga!"" you exclaim.  The man holding the gun looks at you and laughs.  ""It's okay, I know who you are,"" he says.  He points his gun at you and fires 

 \&gt; You sensing the bullet coming towards your face, you tap into your years of experience as a masked wrestler and prepare to suplex the masked man.   

Your body is hit by the bullet, but it doesn't stop you from performing a suplex on the gunman. The bullets ricochet off the steel floor and explode outwards. Bullets fly everywhere, but they don't stop you  

\&gt; You as blood seeps from your wound, you scream at the top of your lungs ""(I am the great El Tortuga, and today evil will not pierce my shell!)"".   

You fall backwards, but the gunman shoots again. This time you manage to roll away from the bullets and land in the middle of the room. He fires another shot and this one hits you right in the chest 

 \&gt; You powering through the pain, you charge the gunman and grab his throat and perform your finishing move.   

You punch him in the throat and pull his head back with both hands. He lets out a scream of agony and falls backwards. You feel a burst of energy go through you and throw the gunman forward. His head smacks against the wall and then explodes 

 \&gt; You emboldened, you look around the room and shout ""(Isn't there anyone who can stand up to the might of EL TORTUGA)"".   

You turn around and see several men armed with guns standing behind you. They're all staring at you with fear. ""Who are you?"" one asks.  

\&gt; You you walk up slowly to the man. Covered in blood, you wrap your arms around his waist and get right up in his face. With your nose pressed against his, you whisper into his ear ""(My name is El Tortuga, and today justice shall be steady)"".

   The man stares at you for a moment before nodding.  

\&gt; You you shout ""(EL TORTUGA!)"" as you lift the man off his feet and deliver a ground shattering belly to belly suplex.   

You drop the man and continue to the other side of the room where you find more men armed with guns. You raise your fists and begin punching them repeatedly in their faces. You kick some of them in the balls while others attempt to run away  

\&gt; As you raise your hand in victory, you begin to succumb to your wounds.   

You collapse onto the floor and begin to bleed out. You hear someone call out to you. It's the man who shot you earlier. ""Hey! What happened? How'd that guy do that to you?"" You try to speak, but you have no strength left in you

 that governs them

\&gt; I yawn and my mantle quakes.

&amp;#x200B;

""I am tired,"" you say to the air. ""I am tired"".

&amp;#x200B;

The sun is up by now, but it's not yet time for you to go to sleep. The world

 is still waking up, and you need to keep yourself occupied

\&gt; I create fucked up animals underground

&amp;#x200B;

You begin creating weird creatures in the dirt. They're all different shapes

 and sizes, some with horns, others without. Some look like they've been ripped

 out of a children's book, while others seem more like they belong on an alien

 planet

\&gt; I grow fond of my monsters. I encourage them to move to the surface.

&amp;#x200B;

Your monsters are happy with their new surroundings. They start moving around

 to the surface, where they happily feast upon the humans that come to live here.

 Soon, there isn't enough food for everyone anymore.

Soon, the humans have no choice but to leave as well

\&gt; I watch the humans move to the sea, creating floating islands.

&amp;#x200B;

You watch as the humans slowly move towards the sea. They build large structures

 at the water's edge, which become islands. These islands soon become home to

 many species of fish, crabs, and other aquatic life

\&gt; I watch my monsters evolve, learning to speak and make tools.

&amp;#x200B;

Your monsters learn how to communicate with each other and with humans. They

 also learn to use tools, such as spears and hooks. Soon, they can hunt down

 prey, and even eat human flesh.

\&gt; My monsters love human flesh. They attack the humans relentlessly.

&amp;#x200B;

You watch as your monsters devour humans. They eat them alive, or rip them apart

 limb from limb. Eventually, they learn to enjoy eating humans, and they begin

 to breed with them. This leads to a race of monsters known as the Cannibals

\&gt; These cannibals smell like death and have long arms. The humans hate them.

&amp;#x200B;

These cannibals are very similar to your monsters, except they don't taste quite

 so good. They're also much shorter than your monsters, and have longer arms.

 Humans find them disgusting, and they're hated by the humans. Eventually, they

 die out completely

\&gt; The humans survive long enough to master the seas. They begin to live underwater.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually, the humans learn to live underwater. They begin building cities made

 of coral, and eventually build ships to sail across the oceans. In time, they

 begin to colonize the entire ocean floor.

\&gt; I watch as my monsters die and eventually become extinct.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually, the humans manage to conquer most of the land, and eventually wipe

 out the monsters entirely

\&gt; I grow tired.

&amp;#x200B;

You realize that you've spent too much time in the sunlight, and you lie down

 to rest. Your body feels heavy, and you know you'll be exhausted when you wake

 up tomorrow

\&gt; Tomorrow is a new day. I yawn again.

&amp;#x200B;

You open your eyes, and see that you've slept through the night. You sit up,

 groggily rubbing your eyes. You quickly get dressed, and head downstairs. You

 walk into the kitchen, where you see that your mother has breakfast ready

\&gt; My mother is also a planet

&amp;#x200B;

You think about this for a moment. You decide that you will name her... Earth

\&gt; A storybook closes. An old, bespectacled man looks up at a child. ""That is how the Earth was made"" he says to the child. The child scrunches their nose and says ""That's fucking dumb grandpa. Please stop drinking.""

# EDIT

Thanks to /u/kik4444 for giving **actually useful info**

Here is what i did (based on his brilliant comment) to get it to run.

[ARCH USERS! The install.sh is made for Debian based distros]

1. git clone https://github.com/AIDungeon/AIDungeon.git 
2. sudo pacman -S aria2

3. ./install

after this is finished:
pip

---
 
1. yay -S python36 - to install python 3.6


2. wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py - to clone the install dir of pip


3. sudo python3.6 get-pip.py (In the same directory!). After this in done, in the dir you installed AIDungeon, do 


4. sudo python3.6 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

---

After you are finished; you are free to enter the command:

   Python3.6 play.py..

---

If you get the issue: UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode characters in position 2-4: ordinal not in range(128)

the solution is to edit play.py


(in play.py)

**You say ""to cut cost, I think I will run it on** [**https://www.patreon.com/**](https://www.patreon.com/) **""**

&amp;#x200B;

You continue ""I am currently making $1 per hour in profit from this game. If

 you can help me get more people playing, I would be forever grateful"".

**You say ""And then I shall sync up with the AI Dungeon 2 modding group to see**

 **if they have any solution""**

&amp;#x200B;

You finish your speech and walk away.

**You say ""Is there any other way to save cost?""**

&amp;#x200B;

 You ask a few of your friends who are still waiting for their turn to talk to

 you.

&amp;#x200B;

The next day you all head out to the park where you hope to find some new players.

 You meet up at the park and start walking around looking for people

**You say ""Hello! Would anyone want to try AI DUNGEON 2?""**

&amp;#x200B;

 You call out to the crowd.

A few people come over and you explain the rules. They seem very interested and

 begin to play right away. It seems like everyone is having fun. You even manage

 to convince one person that they should donate money to the project

**You say ""Five dollars each person should be able to cover the hosting cost, hopefully.""**

&amp;#x200B;

 You say as you leave.

You spend the rest of the day playing and talking to your friends. You end up

 getting home around midnight and you decide to go to sleep. As you are about

 to fall asleep, you hear a knock on the door

**You say ""This is Google, you owe us money!""**

&amp;#x200B;

 You yell out loud.

You wake up and realize that you forgot to lock the door so you open it up. A

 man stands before you with a clipboard in hand. He looks like he has been working

 here for years.

He says 

**You say ""Where is my royalty, Nick?""**

&amp;#x200B;

 You say.

You both stare at each other for a moment and then he says 

**You say ""This is not a joke. ;) ""**

&amp;#x200B;

You say ""Well I guess we are going to have to pay you now"". You say.

You both look at each other and agree to what he has proposed. You tell him how

 much you need to pay and he tells you how much he needs to give

**You say ""Ok guess I will have to pay""**

&amp;#x200B;

 You say.

You both enter into an agreement and the deal is done. You both go back to your

 respective homes

**You say ""home, sweet home""**

&amp;#x200B;

 You say.

You both enjoy your time together and make plans for the future.

     spellbook. You finish your long journey and finally arrive at the ruin you've
     been looking for. You look around and see that it's not much different than
     when you left it. The only thing is now there's a giant skeleton standing right
     outside the door.
    &gt; talk to the skeleton
    
    The skeleton looks up from its book and sees you. It raises an eyebrow as if
     to say ""what?"" before answering:
    
    ""Hello, I'm ai. I live here"".
    
    ""I don't understand,"" he says.

    &gt; ask what the book was about
    
    ""It's about magic spells"", he says.
    &gt; what kind of spells
    
    ""They're called necromancy"".
    &gt; say ""I'm a necromancer!""
    
    ""No, no, no! No, no, no! That's not it at all! Look, I just want to go home!"",
     he exclaims.

    ""That's right! I don't want to be resurrected! I want to go back to my grave!""

    ""Oh, okay then. But how do I get there?""
    &gt; We can both walk together
    
    ""Okay then, let me lead you there"".
    &gt; go to the skeleton's grave
    
    You enter the graveyard and follow the skeleton into his grave. The two of you
     stand on top of the grave and look down at each other. He begins to speak:
    ""So, you're a wizard, aren't you?"", he asks.
    &gt; yes
    
    ""Yes, I am. And you're a wizard too, aren't you?""
    &gt; I am a necromancer
    
    ""Yeah, I guess so"".
    &gt; well, go into your grave
    
    ""Um... Okay.."".
    &gt; place skeleton into the grave
    
    He nods and turns around to leave. As he walks away, you turn around and put
     him back in the grave.
    &gt; walk back to the ruin
    
    You return to the ruins and find that the rest of the party has already left.
     You sigh and start walking towards your own grave.
    &gt; destroy the grave
    
    You begin to chant a spell which causes the ground to crumble and open up a hole
     for you to fall through. Unfortunately, you fall straight into the grave instead

    You quickly rise up out of the grave and see that you are now wearing a black
     robe with a hood. You look around and notice that you are in a large cemetery.
     There are many graves in the area, but none of them seem to belong to anyone
     else
    &gt; play doom
    
    You cast doom and all the dead rise up to attack you. You kill most of them,
     but some manage to escape. They run off to tell others about your deeds. Eventually,

You are Judas, a peasant living in the kingdom of Larion. You have a pitchfork and a nothing else. You wake up and begin working in the fields. You see a girl named Mary who looks like your sister, but you don't know her name. One day she comes to work with a man called Simon

&gt; You say ""hello"" to mary and simon.


Mary: ""Hello"".

Simon: ""Hi!""

You continue to work in the fields for a few days until one day when you're picking some weeds you hear a voice calling out to you from behind a bush. It's the voice of Jesus Christ

&gt; You drop to your knees and look at Jesus Christ.


You kneel down and stare at Jesus Christ. He is dressed in a white robe and has long black hair and a beard. He smiles at you and says ""I'm glad to see you, my son"".
 

&gt; You voice shaking say ""What can I do for you, my Lord?"".


Jesus Christ: ""Well I need to get back home, but before I leave I want to show you something"".
You nod and follow him into his house. The first thing he does is take off his shoes and socks and then puts on a pair of clean ones

&gt; You you take off your shoes and follow Jesus Christ.


You take off your shoes and socks and follow Jesus Christ into his bedroom. There he sits on a bed wearing only a loin cloth. He looks up at you with a smile and says ""Now that's what I call love right there"". Then he begins to caress your face and neck

&gt; You ask Jesus ""Is this really alright, My Lord? Isn't this a sin?"".


Jesus Christ: ""It isn't, it's just how we've been raised. Now come closer and let me show you something more"". He takes your hand and leads you over to the couch where he lies down and starts kissing on you.

&gt; You ask Jesus ""What would your father think?"".


Jesus Christ: 

&gt; You tell Jesus that you didn't consent to this.


Jesus Christ: ""He'd be proud of you, wouldn't he?""

&gt; You ask him ""Why do you say that?"".


Jesus Christ: ""Because he's always telling us not to do things like this, but we don't listen to him because we're too **** happy about everything! We should all be happy and live our lives to the fullest!"".

&gt; You tell Jesus that he's being blasphemous.


Jesus Christ: 

&gt; You look at Jesus Christ.


Jesus Christ: ""Oh no, I'm sorry, I didn't mean anything by that, I was just so happy to see you again after so long"".

&gt; You run out of Jesus' house screaming in terror.


You run out of Jesus' house screaming in terror. You hide under a nearby tree and cry as you wait for the police to arrive

&gt; You wait for the police to arrive.


The police arrive shortly afterwards and arrest you. They say they'll send you to the king for trial. When you're brought before the king, he asks you if you've ever heard of the sabbath law

&gt; You ask him what the Sabbath law is.


The king: ""That's the law that says you can't go to church on Sunday"".

&gt; You tell the King that you didn't go to church on sunday.


The king: ""No, you didn't either, you were here all week and never went to church. You must be a pagan or a heathen"".

&gt; You tell the King that you were sick with fever all week.


The king: ""A heathen huh? Well maybe you should pray to the sun instead of the devil"".

&gt; You beg the king for forgiveness and tell him that you'll become a pious man.


The king: ""If you're begging for forgiveness, then you're doing a good job of it, but if you insist on lying to me, then I'll hang you by your wrists"".

&gt; You tell the king that in exchange for your freedom you can tell him about another heathen.


The king: ""Another heathen eh? Well I suppose you could tell me about a guy called Jareth who lived in a cave in the mountains. He had a pet monkey named Baloo""

&gt; You tell the King ""No, your Majesty... Jesus Christ tried to molest me and spoke blasphemous words!"".


The king: ""Hah! That's a load of bull, you know I believe in free will, so if you tell me about Jesus Christ, I won't hang you anyway"".

&gt; You ask for Jesus Christ to appear in court.


The king: ""What?! No way! I'm not going to allow such blasphemy in court, you're lucky you weren't killed"".

**Prompt:**  You are a beet farmer named Dwight Schrute. Your day job is at local paper supply  company, Dunder Mifflin. You love your job as Assistant Regional Manager, but you have a tumultuous relationship with your coworker, Jim Halpert. He's always playing stupid pranks on you, and you hate it. Today, you walked into the office  and saw that Jim has pulled his most elaborate prank yet. 

**Start:** Jim has hidden a bomb under your desk! It's a fake bomb, of course, just to make  things interesting. The only way to disarm it is for someone to find it in time 

*&gt; Try to follow the bomb's beeping noise to find the location of the bomb*  

You immediately turn around and start walking away from the desk, but Jim stops  you. ""Hey wait!"" he says. ""I know where this one is"".  

The beeping sound continues to go on and on. Then suddenly it stops. 

 *&gt; Yell at Jim to stop pulling stupid pranks on you*  

""Stop doing that!"" you shout. ""It's not funny anymore"". 

Jim looks surprised by your outburst. ""What? I thought you were getting tired  of hearing it"".  

*&gt; Sit down at your desk across from Jim and try to ignore him*  

You sit back in your chair and look out a window as you continue to ignore Jim.  The sun is shining brightly outside and you can see people going about their  lives. 

This day has been nothing but trouble for you 

*&gt; Try to focus on working despite Jim continuing to annoy you*  

You keep your eyes glued to the computer screen as you work. After an hour or  so, you hear a loud explosion followed by a bright flash. 

You quickly check your monitor and see a big red X over the map with a note saying  'Explosion'. A small explosion 

*&gt; Ask Jim what prank he's pulled on you now*  

You stand up and walk towards Jim who is still sitting at his desk. ""What are  you doing?"" you say. 

""Nothing! It was just a simple explosion"". Jim replies. 

 *&gt; Storm into the manager's office and ask to file a formal complaint against Jim*  

You head to the manager's office and knock on the door. When no-one answers,  you open it up and enter. There stands the manager, who looks very upset.

walls surrounding it were destroyed years ago by an unknown force.

As you walk through the ruins, you hear sounds of battle all around you

\&gt; make sure sounds are real

You take out your staff and cast a few spells to help you find what is going

on. You don't get far before you feel the effects of the magic. Your body feels

like its being crushed under tons of stone. You fall down some stairs and you

can hear more sounds of fighting

\&gt; cast perception spell

You cast your perception spell and you see several figures running away from

you. They run past a large hole in the wall and then they disappear into another

room. You follow them and you end up in a small room with a table and chairs.

There are two doors on opposite sides of the room

You shout at the people behind the door. They stop and look around. Then one

of them opens it and walks over to you. He looks very tired and his face shows

he has been crying for days. He hugs you tightly and says

says he didn't mean to kill them but he couldn't control himself. He had too

much anger inside him

forgiven. He asks if you would forgive him. You tell him yes. He thanks you

and kisses you on the cheek. He says he will try to control his temper better

now

\&gt; try to remember if you ever met him

You think back to the time you first met him. It must have been long ago. You

never thought you'd meet him again. You wonder how he knew who you were. You

wonder if he even remembers you. You wonder if he knows anything about the other

wizards in the city

\&gt; ""have you seen any other wizards?

I've heard rumors of a wizard academy in the city. Maybe you know something

about it.

He seems surprised by your suggestion. He doesn't want to go there. He says he

needs to focus on getting better. He goes back to his seat and gives you a smile.

He says he'll call you later. He leaves you and heads off to his class

\&gt; think ""where am I?""

You wake up in a strange place. You aren't sure where you are or what happened.

You turn around and see a big wooden door. You walk towards it and open it.

Inside is a classroom. A teacher stands behind a desk. She looks at you and

smiles

\&gt; ""is this a dream?""

She nods. You nod back and she continues to speak. ""This is the academy. We

teach young wizards how to use their powers properly. Some of them become great

wizards. Others become teachers"". She pauses and looks at you.

to the teacher. She notices you and smiles. She tells you to sit down and she

will show you something special. She takes a book out of her bag and hands it

to you

\&gt; Read the book

You read the book and it explains everything you need to know about the academy.

You learn that the school is located in the mountains near the city of Nuro

and she laughs. She tells you that you're really smart and that you should come

here soon. She sends you on your wa

see a large book lying on the floor. You pick it up and read it. It explains

everything you need to know about the academy

\&gt; Have an enlightened awakening

You realize that you can do anything you set your mind to. You begin to practice

your powers and you quickly gain power. Soon you are able to levitate objects

and fly through the air. You learn that you can control fire and ice

the ceiling and drop a fireball on the ground below. You laugh as you watch

to search for it and you notice that you can move things with your mind. You

begin to move the bookshelf and it moves closer to you

\&gt; Check what other books are there

You find a few more books in the pile of papers and books. You put them back

and return to your room. You close the door and lock it. You take a deep breath

and exhale. You are finally free of the shackles of the Academy. You feel like

a new person

\&gt; Wake up one last time

You awaken from your sleep feeling refreshed. You look around and see that you

are in a small room. There is a table with several chairs and a bed. You look

at yourself in the mirror and see that you are wearing a blue robe. You walk

forward and sit down at the table

\&gt; Bite the table

You suddenly get hungry so you eat some food. After eating, you feel very full

so you eat another piece of food. After eating that, you feel sick so you vomit.

You fall backwards onto the floor and scream. Your screams cause everyone to

run away from the room

\&gt; Think ""where did they came from?""

You wake up and realize that you are in a forest. You look around and see trees

and bushes and plants. You look around and see a river flowing water. You look

around and see a cave. You look around and see a hill. You look around and see

a lake

2019-12-09-081750,,"Rhybo, The Dancing Knight... be wary of his bow","You are Rhybo, a knight living in the kingdom of Larion. You have a steel longsword and a wooden shield. You are on a quest to defeat the evil dragon of Larion. You've heard he lives up at the north of the kingdom. You set on the path to defeat him and walk into a dark forest. As you enter the forest you see a huge black dragon flying over the trees. He is so big that it takes all your strength just to stand before him  

\&gt; You hurl your shield at the dragon.   

The shield hits the dragon square in the chest. The dragon lets out a roar and his wings beat furiously. His claws begin to glow red hot as they draw closer to you.  ""No!"" you shout and throw your sword at the dragon's head  

\&gt; You throw your sword at the dragon's head.  

Your sword flies through the air and strikes the dragon square in the neck. The dragon roars and falls from the sky. You look around and see the other dragons circling above you. They must be attacking the village or something. You don't know what to do now  

\&gt; You calm the dragons down with interpretive dance.   

You turn to face the dragons and begin dancing in their direction. A few of them seem to like it and fly away. Others try to bite you but you manage to dodge each time. Eventually all the dragons have left and the villagers are back inside  

\&gt; You take a bow in your chain mail.   

You take a bow in your chainmail and fire off several arrows at the dragons. One lands near one of them and he lets out a bellow. He begins to growl and charge towards you. You raise your hands up and the dragons stop charging and go back into their lairs  

\&gt; You wiggle your spirit fingers.   

You wiggle your spirit fingers and the dragons stop charging and return to their lairs. You run outside and find that the villagers have returned. They tell you that the dragons were killed by the villagers. You thank them and then ask if there is anything else you can help with  

\&gt; You tell them they are liars since they didn't do that.   

You tell the villagers that they are lying since they didn't actually kill any dragons. They say that they just scared them off and ran for cover. You tell them that they should've attacked first since they could've easily taken care of the dragons themselves  

\&gt; You praise the sun.   

You praise the sun and say that the villagers did indeed scare the dragons off. They thank you again and you leave. You're tired and hungry so you decide to rest on the way home  

\&gt; You fall asleep on your horse.   

You sleep on your horse and soon after you wake up you hear some noise. It sounds like orcs. You ride over to investigate and you see a bunch of orcs running away from some sort of dragon attack. They aren't very far away though.  

\&gt; You ride to the orcs.   

You ride to the orcs and you quickly catch up to them. They are heading north. You tell them that they need to get to the nearest town. They agree and you both ride on. Soon you arrive at the closest town. It looks pretty much the same as when you last saw it 

\&gt; You check to see if the dragon followed you.   

You check to make sure the dragon hasn't followed you. You find that the dragon has not moved an inch from where she was before. She seems to think you are dead. You wonder if this means you won.  

\&gt; You start square dancing.   

You start square dancing and the dragon starts to follow suit. Soon the two of you are doing a little bit of everything. You are having such fun that you forget about the dragon until she suddenly attacks you. You feel her teeth sink deep into your shoulder blade  

\&gt; You tell the dragon she's been rick rolled and signal the ambush.   

You tell the dragon that she's been ricked rolled and signal the ambush. The dragon charges at you and you deflect her blows. You land a blow to her side and she goes flying backwards. You watch her hit the ground and then you sense another dragon coming your way  

\&gt; You do the macarina.   

You do the macarina and the dragon stops moving completely. You tell the villagers to stay put while you go talk to the dragon. You approach the dragon and you notice that she isn't injured at all. In fact she looks quite healthy  

\&gt; You offer to waltz with the dragon.   

You offer to waltz with the dragon. She accepts and you both walk away from the battle. After a short while you come across a group of dwarves who are talking about how the dragon attacked them. You explain that the dragon attacked the dwarves and they survived 

 \&gt; You teach the dwarves how to breakdance.   

You teach the dwarves how to breakdance. They become quite skilled at it and the next day they win a tournament. You also learn that the dragon has grown quite fond of them and will no longer attack them

=======================================

Starting Prompt: **you are Jack, a failed Hollywood Screenwriter looking for new screenplay ideas.**

Generating story...

&amp;#x200B;

you are Jack, a failed Hollywood Screenwriter looking for new screenplay ideas.

You're in the middle of writing one when you suddenly feel like someone is watching

you.

You turn around and see that it's just yourself

**&gt; or is it?**

&amp;#x200B;

The voice is familiar, but you can't place where you heard it before. It sounds

like it belongs to someone who knows what they're doing.

""I'm sorry about this, I'm sure you must be feeling very lonely right now"". The

voice says

**&gt; tell the voice to give me screenplay ideas**

&amp;#x200B;

""Okay, okay, I'll listen"". You say with a smile.

""Well then let me get started on your next script idea"".

**&gt; listen to the script idea**

&amp;#x200B;

You open up the file and begin reading.

It's a simple story of a man who was once a hero in his own country, but lost

all that when he went off to fight against the Empire

**&gt; ask the voice to describe the story in detail**

&amp;#x200B;

""So the story goes, there are two main characters, one is a man called ""Sgt.

Jameson

**&gt; continue listening**

&amp;#x200B;

""He's a soldier from a small town called ""Pipistrelle

**&gt; continue listening**

&amp;#x200B;

""And the other character is a woman called ""Mrs. Pipistrelle

**&gt; continue listening**

&amp;#x200B;

""She's a housewife from a large city called ""Tiverton

**&gt; continue listening**

&amp;#x200B;

""They both have their own reasons for going off to war, but ultimately they both

come back home"".

**&gt; continue listening**

&amp;#x200B;

""But what really makes this story interesting is the fact that they don't always

return"".

**&gt; ask the voice, ""why don't they always return?""**

&amp;#x200B;

""Because they die"".

**&gt; ask the voice, ""how do they die?""**

&amp;#x200B;

""In the beginning they just fall into battle, but eventually they start dying

of disease, or even worse, starvation"".

**&gt; ask the voice, ""can you save them from dying?"".**

&amp;#x200B;

""No, because they don't know how to do it"".

**&gt; ask the voice, ""how would you end the story?"".**

&amp;#x200B;

""Well, if you could do something, then you'd probably want to see the ending"".

**&gt; ask the voice, ""tell me the ending of the story."".**

&amp;#x200B;

""Well, the ending would be for the soldiers to find out that they can live forever,

by finding a way to turn themselves into a machine"".

**&gt; praise the voice, ""that is a great ending!"".**

2019-12-09-083244,,A Comedian Cockroach must put on the show of a lifetime to convince his boss he is worth something; but does he ultimately succeed?,"You are a world-famous talking cockroach. You are great at comedy, but you are very clumsy. Your boss is an old and evil man who has told you he plans on killing you if you do bad at tonight's comedy show. He wants to see how good of a comedian you really are before he kills you 

&gt; You get on stage. 

You decide that the best way to avoid your fate would be to get on stage as soon as possible. You don't have much time though; your boss will kill you in no time if you aren't funny enough

&gt; You try to make a joke about cockroaches.

""I'm not going to lie to you,"" you say. ""I am a cockroach"". Your boss looks surprised by this statement. ""A... what?"" he asks. ""I'm not going to lie to you,"" you continue.

&gt; You you tell him you are a cockroach.

""What? A cockroach?"" your boss says, sounding very shocked. ""No! No! I mean, no!"" ""Well, yes,"" you say. ""But it's just a metaphor"". ""Oh, okay then,"" your boss says

&gt; You try to dance and sing.

""Okay, okay, I'll do something else"". You stand up from your chair and walk over to the microphone. As you approach the mic, you start dancing around with some of your fellow employees. Your boss walks over to the microphone and starts laughing

&gt; You ask your boss if you are funny.

""I'm not sure if I am.."". your boss says. ""Are you kidding me?"" you exclaim. ""If I wasn't a cockroach, I'd be a comedian"".

&gt; You try to make a joke about venezuela.

 ""Venezuela is a country full of people who like to eat ****"". Your boss turns his head away from you and stares at the floor. He doesn't seem to hear you.

&gt; You say the joke again but even louder.

""I'm sorry sir, but Venezuela isn't a country full of people who like to eat "". ""It is, it is!"" ""Yes, it is!"" ""No, it isn't!""

&gt; You discuss the pros and cons of socialism.

""Socialism works out great in places like Cuba, right?"" ""Yeah, but.."". ""But what?"" ""But they're still poor there"". 

&gt; You argue that being poor is subjective.

""Hey, we all know that being poor is subjective"". ""Yeah, but."". ""But what?"" ""But it's subjective"".

&gt; You laugh. ""Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!""

&gt; You ask your boss if he wants to laugh too.

""Sure, why not?"" You and your boss laugh together. The laughter is so loud that you can barely hear yourself think. The laughter seems to go on forever and then suddenly stop. Your boss stands up from his seat and stares at you. His face has changed into one of surprise. He begins to speak slowly

&gt; You listen to your boss.

""You see, I was joking about.."".

&gt; You continue listening.

""..being a cockroach. It's true, but.."".

&gt; You continue listening.

""..it's also true that I'm a socialist. But it's not because I want to take everything for myself. It's because I want everyone to have an equal chance to succeed. That's why I'm a socialist"".

&gt; You accept him for who he is.

""Thank you sir, I appreciate your honesty"".

&gt; You politely ask your boss to not kill you. 

""Alright, alright, I won't kill you. Just let me finish my speech first"".

&gt; You listen to your boss's speech.

""So, how many of you here have ever been fired before?""

&gt; You tell your boss you've never been fired.

 ""Good, now how many of you have ever had a job where you were fired?""

&gt; You tell your boss no.

""Now, how many of you have ever had a job where you were fired after only a few days?""

&gt; You deny.

""How about a job where you were fired after only a few hours?""

&gt; You ask your boss to get to the point.

""Alright, how about a job where you were fired after only a few minutes?""

&gt; You deny.

""How about a job where you were fired after only a few seconds?""

&gt; You attemlt to reply to your boss with a clever joke. 

""Alright, how about a job where you were fired after only a few seconds after getting caught stealing?""

&gt; You get off the stage and say goodbye.

""Goodbye sir, I hope you find something else to do soon"". With those last words, your boss walks out of the room leaving you alone.

&gt; You do cockroach things.

You sit down on the couch and begin to play with your phone. You look at the time and realize that you haven't slept yet. You quickly check the time on your phone and realize that you don't have much time left. You decide to call your mom

&gt; You say hello to your mother.

""Hello Mom?"". ""Heeeeeyyyy there, son!"".

&gt; You tell your mother that you are not dead.

""Oh? Well, I guess I'll believe you when you start talking again"".

&gt; You check if you are still alive.

""I'm sorry, I just...I just couldn't talk to you anymore.."".

&gt; You check your body for wounds.

""Well, I guess we all die eventually"".

&gt; You ask your mother if you are dead.

""No, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you like that. I just thought you'd be scared of what happened to you"".

&gt; You cry.

""Awwww, c'mon, it's okay.."".

&gt; You hang up the phone and sleep.

You lie in bed and try to think of some way to make this situation better. The problem is, you can't think of anything. Your life has become so meaningless that you feel like you're going insane. In fact, you wonder if you should even bother trying to live through this night

&gt; You call your boss.

""Hey, I need help"".

&gt; You ask him to come back and kill you.

""What? No, I'm sorry, but I'm not coming back tonight. I already told you that I'm not interested in working for someone who doesn't respect his workers"".

&gt; You bribe.

""Bribe? For what?""

&gt; You ask your boss to kill you for money. ""For killing you, of course! What do you want me to give you in exchange for helping me kill you?"".

&gt; Nothing.

""Fine, then I'm not coming back either"".

&gt; You plead for your boss to come back.

""Why would I come back to work for someone who won't help me kill you?""

&gt; You hang up the phone and look out the window.

""Man, I really wish I could go back in time and change my own fate"", you mutter as you stare at the moon.

&gt; You try to run and jump out of the window.

&gt; You check to see if the door is locked.


You walk over to the door and try to open it. It doesn't budge. You can hear voices outside. You don't know who they might be or what they're saying but you figure you should go investigate anyway.
 

&gt; You you cast a spell on the door to hear what the people inside are talking about.


You quickly cast a spell of some sort on the door. The door opens up and you enter the room. Inside the room there are several tables and chairs along with various items on them. You see a man sitting in one of the chairs

&gt; You you point your staff at the man and ask him ""what are you doing here?"".


The man looks surprised by your question. He then replies ""I'm here because I was asked to help"".
You say ""asked to help with what?""


He explains that he was told to bring back something for someone called 'M' who lives in the city of Ralok'. M has been missing for quite some time now and his assistant 'D' wants the item brought back as soon as possible
You say ""What did they ask you to bring back?""


""They didn't tell me what it was exactly"".
""Well, you'll find out when you get there"".
You leave the man and head towards the exit of the room. As you do so you notice a small door at the end of the hall leading into another room

You walk into the next room and see a large table covered with various objects. There's also a door at the other side of the room which leads into a corridor.

&gt; You grab a key from the table.


You grab a key off the table and put it in the lock of the door. You then turn around and look through the window at the city of Ralok.

&gt; You you see the sky filled with dark purple clouds.


You see the sky fill with dark purple clouds. You hear a loud noise in the distance. You can't tell where it comes from though. You feel like you've been walking all day without food. You haven't eaten anything since lunchtime yesterday. You need to eat something

You wake up and realize you've slept for quite awhile. You head downstairs and see a staircase going down. You climb down the stairs and find yourself in a long hallway. You follow the hallway until you reach a door with a big red lettering on it

&gt; You read the writing on the door.


You open the door and see a large wooden sign on the wall

Welcome to the City of Ralok!
This city was once home to many prosperous citizens. However, the land was cursed by an evil force known only as the Dark Lord

&gt; You continue reading.


The Dark Lord is a powerful being who seeks to destroy everything good in the world. His goal is to make the world a place of eternal darkness. He uses the powers of shadows to attack those who oppose him. He is extremely dangerous and will stop at nothing to achieve his goals

He replies ""Bring me a crucifix or a unicorn horn"".

&gt; You you hand him some unicorn hair ""will this work?"".


You hand him some unicorn hair and he casts a holy bolt at you. The bolt hits you and you fall unconscious. When you wake up you find yourself lying on the floor of the room and the tutor has vanished. You look around and see a small figure standing over you

You hear a voice behind you ""Oh, you fell asleep again. How did you forget to bring me something holy?""
You say ""I didn't forget, you attacked me!""


""Ah, well, I guess you'll have to pay me now"".
You say ""why would I pay you for attacking me""


""Because you're going to die anyway! Now let me show you what happens when you fail!""

""What is it?"" you ask.

The voice sounds like that of a young girl's

&gt; You hide behind a tree.


You quickly hide behind a tree and wait for the creature to pass by. It passes
 by and then stops nearby. The creature stands there looking at you with its
 red eyes.
""Who are you?"" the creature asks.
""I am David,"" you reply

&gt; You say ""Why do you have the voice of a little girl, mysterious creature?"".


""Because I was born this way"".

&gt; You say ""A thousand pardons, mysterious creature. I have never met one of your
 kind before."".


The creature looks at you and it's mouth opens wide. It begins to speak.
""My name is... the one who saved me from the forest.."".
""What? Who are you?""
""I'm not sure myself. But I think my name is.."".


&gt; You little Debbie.


Little Debbie turns her head slightly as if she heard something strange. She
 smiles and says ""Hello, David. My name is Little Debbie. What's yours?""

&gt; You say ""My name is David. Just like you just said it."".


Little Debbie nods her head slowly and says ""Yes, very good. So what do you want
 to do now?""

&gt; You say ""Well, I was hunting that deer over there, but now I do not feel like
 taking it's life."".


Little Debbie looks at you and smiles. She takes out a small pouch on her belt
 and pulls out a small silver coin. She places it into her mouth and swallows
 it whole. She then puts the pouch back on her belt

&gt; You raise your eyebrow in disapproval.


Little Debbie smiles and says ""Oh, don't worry about that. I can make you anything
 you want. I will show you how"".

&gt; You say ""Teach me how to make the perfect gluten-free beer"".


Little Debbie looks at you and says ""Sure, why not?""

&gt; You drink gluten-free beer.


You take a large glass bottle filled with beer and begin pouring it into the
 bottle cap. You close the lid and place it back on top of the bottle. You then
 take another bottle and fill it with water. You pour both liquids into the bottle
 caps and seal them up

&gt; You grimace at poor taste of gluten-free beer.


You sigh and say ""This tastes terrible. This is so bad"".

 your beer. Soon after, you hear a loud noise. You open your eyes and see a bright

You are Gondolf, a wizard living in the kingdom of Larion. You have a staff and
 a spellbook. You finish your long journey and finally arrive at the ruin you've
 been looking for. You look around and see that it's not much different than
 when you left it years ago. The only thing different is that now there is a
 large group of orcs standing outside the ruined tower
&gt; Attempt to sneak into the ruin

You try to sneak inside the ruins but the orcs block your way. They seem to be
 guarding the entrance to the tower. You think about trying to get past them
 but then you remember that they might just shoot you if you do so
&gt; Cast chain lighting at orcs

You quickly cast chain lightning at the orcs blocking your way. It seems like
 they don't even feel the shockwave. Then you notice that one orc has fallen
 down from his own height and he doesn't move anymore. He looks like he's dead.
 You can't believe this
&gt; Status report

Your status report is complete: you've killed all the orcs and you're still alive!
&gt; search dead orcs

You continue searching for more orcs but you find nothing. The orcs aren't dead
 yet though. They're hiding somewhere in the ruins. You look around for something
 else to kill but there isn't anything else here either. You need to find some
 other place to hide out
&gt; revert
Last action reverted. 
Your status report is complete: you've killed all the orcs and you're still alive!
&gt; loot dead orcs

You loot the bodies of the dead orcs for their weapons and armor. The orcs aren't
 as strong as you thought...
&gt; enter the tower

You climb up the ladder and reach the top of the tower. You see a large door
 with an ancient symbol on it. You wonder if it's locked or something. You open
 the door and there is a giant stone face staring back at you.
&gt; Greet the giant face

You approach the giant stone face and give it a friendly wave. Suddenly the giant
 face turns its head away and starts to walk towards you. You start to panic
 because you don't know what will happen next.
&gt; Mae govannen!

The giant face stops walking and stares at you. It's eyes are red and swollen.
 Its mouth is wide open and it's tongue is hanging out.
&gt; Give water to the giant face

You give the giant face some water. It gulps it down and smiles at you. It seems
 like it wants more.
&gt; Long time no see my friend

Suddenly the giant face grabs you by the hair and shakes you violently. It makes
 you fall down the stairs and roll around until you hit the floor. When you wake
 up, you find yourself in a strange room. There is a table with several books
 on it
&gt; examine books

You pick up a book and read it. It's called ""History of the Empire"". It seems
 very interesting. You look through other books on the table and find that they
 are also very interesting. All of these books are written in old language and
 seem to be very old
&gt; Put books into item storage

You put all the books on the table into your inventory. The books seem to fit
 perfectly into each other.
&gt; examine the room

You inspect the room and realize that it's not made of wood, it's made of stone.
 There are many doors here and you can't figure out how to open any of them.
 The walls are covered with paintings of landscapes and people
&gt; Examine walls carefully. Look for secret passage.

You take a closer look at the wall paintings and find that they depict different
 scenes. Some pictures show mountains, forests, rivers, lakes and seas. Others
 show castles, cities, ships and battles. Still others show animals and plants.
 None of these pictures seem to match anything you know about
&gt; Listen attentively

You listen carefully to the sounds around you. Nothing seems to be wrong. You
 continue to listen and eventually you hear a voice coming from somewhere behind
 you.
&gt; look towards the voice

You turn around and see a tall man wearing a black robe standing before you.
 He looks like he's been crying.
&gt; Ask what is wrong

He looks sad and asks you why you're upset. You explain that you were looking
 for a secret passage to escape the tower. He tells you that he knows nothing
 about such things and that he was born in the year 1000 of the Second Era
&gt; Are you of Numenor?

He nods and says that he is indeed of Numenor. He goes on to say that he used
 to live in the city-state of Gondolin. He mentions that he left there when the
 evil shadowlord known as Shelob attacked the city. He didn't survive the attack
&gt; What bounds you to the living world?

He begins to weep again and tells you that he wishes he could return home. He
 explains that he would love to visit his homeland once again. He says that he
 hopes that someday he'll be able to come back to visit his family. He says that
 he loves them very much
&gt; How did he end up in the tower?

He tells you that he had gone to the city of Rohan to buy some food. He saw a
 group of dwarves fighting a band of goblins. One dwarf was killed and the rest
 fled. He followed them and found himself in the ruins of a ruined tower

2019-12-09-113858,,How I lost my faith,"Prompt: You are a humble priestess of the polytheistic church of The Creepy Ones. People
 seek you for advice when they have trouble. Your life is ascetic, save for the
 copious amounts of rum and cigarettes you consume daily.

Start: You have no family
 or friends, but you do have one thing that you value above all else: your love
 for your pet rat, Mr. Scratch
&gt; smile at Mr. Scratch and offer him some of my rum

""Mr. Scratch, I have something to give you"".

The rat scurries over to you eagerly awaiting your gift.

""Thank you, thank you!"" he says as he takes a big gulp from his bottle. 

&gt; Conduct the usual rites to honour the creepy gods, while waiting for customers

Your ritual begins with a prayer to the creepy god of death, who appears in the
 form of a red-eyed skull, which sits on a throne made out of human bones. He
 looks down upon you from the heavens, and then begins to speak
&gt; listen

""I am Death, the Lord of all things, and you are my servant"".

""You're not going anywhere, Death! I'm here to help you!""


&gt; offer Death some rum

""Death, would you like some rum?""
He grins and takes a drink.

""Very good, my friend"".

You continue...


&gt; conduct the next prayer, which goes to Eris, goddess of chaos

""Eris, Goddess of Chaos, I pray that you will be kind enough to let me use this
 bar as a place to get drunk"".
She smiles and nods her head slowly.
""Of course, my love"".
You continue..

&gt; say, ""Mr. Scratch, do you remember who is the next deity on our list?""

""Yes, yes, it's the one who worships the sun, so I'll just tell him to come up
 to the bar and we can start right now!"".
&gt; conduct prayer for the sun-worshipping god

""Sun-Worshipper, I beg you to allow me to spend the rest of my life in the company
 of your glorious light""
&gt; wait for an answer

""Well, if you insist, but only if you don't mind me calling you 'my dear' every
 once in awhile"".
&gt; say, ""That sounds reasonable, my dear.""

""Goodbye, my dear"", she replies.

&gt; say, ""Well, that's enough attention for the gods today. Let's get this party started, Mr. Scratch!""

""Sure thing, my darling"".
&gt; say, ""Hey, don't get too familiar, rat boy!""

""Oh, no, please don't call me that again!"", he protests.
&gt; apologise to Mr. Scratch and give him more rum

""Sorry, sorry, I got carried away"".
&gt; drink some more

""Mmm, nice"".

&gt; wonder why there's no one around here, except for the gods

""Maybe they're off having fun somewhere else, or maybe they're playing hide and
 seek"".
&gt; say, ""Can you imagine, Mr. Scratch, people having fun somewhere else? Without us?""

""No, because they'd never find us, you know what I mean?"", he asks.
&gt; say, ""I don't, actually, but I blame that on the rum.""

""So you think they're playing hide and seek without us, huh?""

&gt; say, ""That is the only explanation. Come, Mr. Scratch, let us go find them!""

""Yeah, yeah, let's go find them, let's go find them all!"".
&gt; Allow Mr. Scratch to ride on the top of my head and go out to find the hiding people

""Come on, let's go find them, let's go find them all!"".

&gt; walk past the liquor store and look through the windows

""There they are, they're hiding behind those shelves, let's catch them before
 they escape!""
&gt; yell asking why they are hiding

""Because they're scared of us, because they're afraid of us all!"".
&gt; proclaim good intentions

""We're not bad guys, we're just trying to make a living, we're not evil, we're
 just trying to survive, we're not bad, we're just trying to live"".
&gt; wait to see if the people come out of hiding

""They're not coming out, they're all hiding under their desks, let's go catch
 them all!""
&gt; attempt to find the hiding people and drag them all out into the street

""They're all hiding behind these tables, let's catch them all!"".

&gt; shout, ""You heard the rat! We're coming to catch you and then we will all have a party at the temple!""

""Alright, alright, alright, calm down, we'll catch them all, we'll catch them
 all, we'll catch them all!"".
&gt; say, ""Enough with the pokemon chant, Mr. Scratch!""

""Hahaha, okay, alright, calm down, let's go catch them all!"".
&gt; say, ""I swear, if you say that crap about catching them all one more time, I will get mad""

""Okay, okay, calm down, let's go catch them all, let's go catch them all!"".
&gt; sigh

""Fine, fine, let's go catch them all, let's go catch them all!"".
&gt; yell, ""SHUT UP!""

""Shut up! Shut up! They're hiding, they're hiding, let's go catch them all!"".

&gt; cry, ""My rat has turned into a parrot!""

""What?! What happened to you?!""
&gt; say, ""Are you done with looping, Mr. Scratch?""

""Nope, I'm not done with it yet, but I am done with you, my love. I'm going to
 leave you now, because I've had enough of your ****""
&gt; stand in the rain, heartbroken, as Mr. Scratch walks away

""Why did you do this to me?""

&gt; shake fist at the heavens and denounce the gods

""Forgive me, my love, forgive me, I beg you. I beg you, please, I beg you, I
 beg you.."".
&gt; denounce all the gods except Eris

""I don't believe in any god, I don't worship any god, I don't even like you anymore,
 so why should I believe in you?""

&gt; go back to the temple to drink the remaining rum, alone

""Now I can finally rest..""., you say to yourself.

 gold and a small dagger. You are awakened by one of your servants who tells
 you that your keep is under attack. You look out the window and see a group
 of orcs charging towards your door.

""Run!"" you shout. ""I'll hold them off""  
&gt; fart nervously  
  
You don't know what to do! What should you do? How can you help? You just farted
 and it's embarrassing!  
  
&gt; accidentally shit my pants  
  
Oh my god! I shit my pants! I'm so embarrassed!  
You run outside and see your servant holding his head in his hands. He looks
 like he wants to cry, but he doesn't want to be seen crying right now.  
  
&gt; ask the servant for new pants  
  
""Hey, I need new pants!""  
The servant is very surprised by this request. ""What?! Are you fucking crazy?""  
""No, I mean...I think I might have pooped myself"".  
  
&gt; say ""Seriously I need some new pants.""  
  
""Really? Well, we'll get them for you tomorrow morning at dawn"".  
""But I just pooped myself!""  
  
&gt; demand new pants now  
  
""Wait! I want new pants NOW!""  
The servant sighs and says ""Alright then, I'll get them for you as soon as possible"".  
He leaves and you sit down on a nearby stone bench to wait  
&gt; wait for new pants  
  
After about an hour, the servant returns with several pairs of new pants. They're
 not exactly the same as the ones you had, but they're better than nothing. The
 servant also gives you a few coins.  
  
&gt; change in to new pants  
  
Your knees start to hurt from sitting so close together and you feel uncomfortable
 enough that you decide to change into something more comfortable. You put on
 one of the new pants and walk out of the tent.  
As you exit, you hear a voice behind you  
&gt; listen to the voice  
  
It sounds like a woman's. It's not unpleasant, but it isn't pleasant either.  
 She speaks slowly and clearly.  
""Hello, I am Mistress Nalia. I will guide you through this adventure. Do you
 wish to continue?""  
You nod silently  
&gt; say ""I pooped my pants earlier.""  
  
She smiles and nods again. ""Good job. Now tell me, how did you poop yourself?""  
&gt; say ""I was just standing there and tried to fart, but pooped instead.""  
  
She frowns slightly.   
&gt; show her the dirty pants  
  
You hold up the filthy pair of pants and she inspects them. ""Ah, yes, those are
 the pants you were wearing when you pooped yourself. Very bad luck for you"".  
&gt; ask for advice  
  
""How did you poop yourself?""  
&gt; say ""It was an accident.""  
  
She nods. ""Yes, it was an accident. Good thing too, because if you'd been trying
 to fart, you would've gotten caught"".  
&gt; say ""But I was trying to fart.""  
  
She frowns.   
&gt; fart nervously  
  
She laughs. ""Well, that explains why you didn't catch anything"".  
&gt; say ""Have you ever pooped your pants?""  
  
She shrugs. ""Never actually, no. But I suppose I could have. I guess it was lucky
 for you though, since you weren't caught. So, what did you want to do next?""  
&gt; say ""I think I need a shower.""  
  
She smiles.   
&gt; attempt to take a shower  
  
You try to take a shower, but you realize that you don't really know how to use
 a shower. Instead, you just go back inside and lie down on the bed.  
&gt; ask a servant to bathe me  
  
A servant comes running in and bathes you. After the bath, you thank him profusely
 and leave.  
&gt; ask a servant to take dirty laundry  
  
A servant comes running in and takes all your dirty clothes. He puts them away
 neatly and thanks you profusely.  
&gt; try not to poop my pants  
  
You try not to poop your pants, but you still manage to. You look around and
 notice that you're in a strange room. There's a door here and another door there.
 You open the door on the left and find yourself in a bedroom  
&gt; find a new pair of pants  
  
You grab a pair of clean pants and try them on. They fit perfectly. You can't
 believe it. You're finally free! You're going to live happily ever after!

The Year is 3033 and the line between  human and machine has been blurred beyond recognition. DNA splicing has allowed  people to genetically alter themselves in dramatic ways and cyborg post-humans  dance in neon-flooded night clubs. The night is humid and wet as you step out  into the city on your way to speak to your contact Vega about a new gig hacking  into a low level Franchise-corp called Bushido Bags. They make designer hand  bags with a fuedal Nipponese aesthetic but Vega believes they have a hand in  weapons trafficking. Vega wants you to hack into Bushido Bags' datacore and  retrieve any sensitive or redacted data especially if it relates to weapons  or seems shady. You start the day in your skyrise apartment. Your telescreen is ringing and you turn it off, not wanting to bother anyone. A few minutes later you hear a knock at the door

&gt; you don't open the door. Instead you use your VirtuaBell service to see who is knocking from your side of the door. VirtuaBell is an electronic doorbell service that allows the user to know who is at their door without actually opening it.

The voice comes through the intercom ""Vega? Is that you?"" You answer back ""Yes, I am"". ""Well then, come in"" Vega says and opens the door for you. Inside you find yourself in a large living room with a TV mounted above the fireplace

&gt; what does Vega look like, what is he wearing?

A tall man in his late thirties with short black hair and a goatee. He wears a business suit and tie with a leather jacket over top. He carries a briefcase on his shoulder.
 ""Hi Vega, what is in the briefcase?"" I ask.

 Vega looks at me as if I'm crazy ""What do you mean?"" I respond. ""You're not going to believe this, but my name is James Bond"".
 
You say ""Nice, I like when you RP as a secret agent. makes things more fun. What's in the case?""

 Vega takes out a small black box and shows it to me. It has a slot on one side and a keyhole on the other. ""This will unlock the case"" Vega says and hands it to me

&gt; You you use the key to unlock the case. Inside is a brand spanking new GallowTech Electrohack portable systems assault tablet. ""Nice."" you say looking up at Vega.

&gt; What can you do with this?
I press the button on the side of the case and the screen lights up. The screen displays a few lines of text and then a green light appears next to the words ""Activating System""

&gt;  lines of code stream upward on the screen and the Electrohack scans you with a targeted IFF beam. The IFF registers you as the new owner of the GallowTech Electrohack. ""Thank you Vega, this is a wonderful gift."".

&gt; ""Thank you Vega.""
As you turn around to leave Vega calls after you ""Come back here when you have finished hacking!""
 
&gt; "" no thanks, you've had enough""

&gt; you say jokingly.

""No, no, no! You are not allowed to leave until you have completed your task!"" Vega shouts. ""Fine, I'll be back later"" you reply. As you walk away Vega follows behind you

&gt;  you attach a QuickLite cable to the electrohack and tether it to your Alien 2200.

You attach the QuickLite cable to the rear of the Electrohack and then plug it into the Alien 2200. The two devices begin communicating with each other

You are Smurgle, bastard daughter of Tyrion Lannister, living in hiding in the
 King's Landing. It is your birthday, you're 20 years old, and you have decided
 to find your father. You've been looking for him ever since he left for Harrenhal

&gt; go to the castle and ask if Cersei can help

You walk into the throne room where a group of men are talking about something.
 You look around and see that they all seem to be older than you, but then you
 remember that you were born in the year of our Lord 1560, so you must be several
 decades too young to be here
&gt; ask to see Queen Cersei

""I'm sorry, I don't think we can help you"". One of them says. ""We're not even
 sure if she's alive anymore"".
&gt; express disappointment

""Well, I guess I'll just have to find out for myself"". You say and leave.

A few days later you arrive at the city gates. The guards aren't very friendly
 either
&gt; bribe the guards to inspire friendliness

""Hey, what do you guys make?"" You ask.
""What? Oh, nothing, sir"". They reply.
""What do you make?"" You repeat again.
""Nothing, sir"".
&gt; say, ""Here's some gold. Go buy some wine or something.""

They nod and head off. You wait patiently until nightfall when one finally comes
 back with two sacks of coins. He hands you each fifty gold pieces and tells
 you to go get yourself some wine.
The next day you set off on your journey
&gt; decide to travel north, to ask if the Starks know anything about Tyrion

Your first stop is the town of Whitetree which seems pretty quiet. You notice
 a couple of people staring at you though.
&gt; yell, ""Never seen a dwarf before? Don't you know it's rude to stare!""

You hear a chuckle from behind you and turn around only to see a small man wearing
 a cloak standing there.

&gt; introduce myself to the man

He looks surprised by your sudden interest and asks you how old you are.
&gt; explain that I am 20 years old and today is my birthday

He nods and smiles.
&gt; ask the man who he is

He tells you his name is Roldan and that he lives in Whitetree.
&gt; ask if he knows where my father, Tyrion, is

Roldan doesn't answer immediately, but eventually he does.
&gt; wait for the answer

After another minute passes, he speaks up.
&gt; say, ""Yes?""

He shakes his head and sighs.
&gt; shake the man

This time he smiles and says, ""No, no, no. Your father is dead"".
&gt; declare that you don't believe him

He scowls and says, ""Oh yes, he is dead. And you should keep that fact firmly
 in mind for the rest of your life"".

&gt; express firm belief that Tyrion cannot be dead

He frowns and says, ""That's right, you idiot! My son is dead!""

&gt; realize that the man is mad with grief

You quickly run away as fast as you can. A few minutes later you come across
 a group of soldiers fighting a banditry attack. A woman runs up to you and screams,
 
&gt; tell the woman that we need to help those soldiers

She says, ""Don't worry, I won't let anyone hurt you, please help us!""

&gt; with her help, rush to assist the soldiers against the bandits

You grab her hand and together you sprint towards the bandits. After a few moments,
 you feel like you've been stabbed in the side. You fall down and pass out. When
 you wake up, you're lying on the ground surrounded by corpses

&gt; examine the bodies to see if anyone is alive, and more importantly, if they have any coins

You slowly move over to the bodies and begin examining them. There are three
 bodies in total, but only two are still moving. The third corpse has its throat
 cut open and blood gushes out. It appears to be a girl, probably about ten years
 old. She looks terrified and scared
&gt; whisper burial rites over the corpse

You kneel down beside the corpse and pray loudly for her soul to be saved. As
 soon as you finish praying, the girl begins to stir. Her eyes widen and she
 starts to cry.

&gt; tell her everything is alright and the bandits are dead

She wipes her tears and stares at you with wide eyes. She then says, ""My father
 was killed by bandits. My mother died in childbirth. Then my brother died too.
 Now I am here, alone and dying. Please save me, Lord Stark""
&gt; explain that I am not a Stark and definitely not a lord. I am the bastard daughter of Tyrion Lannister.

She nods and says, 
&gt; listen 

She continues, ""I'm sorry, Lord Stark. But I swear, if you will just give me
 the chance, I'll do whatever you want. Just promise me you'll let me live"".
&gt; explain again, pronouncing very clearly, that I am not a Stark

She looks at you sadly and says, 
&gt; listen

She continues, 
&gt; listen

""Lord Stark, I beg you, please. Let me live"".
&gt; shake my head and check the other bodies

The girl looks at you sadly and cries.
&gt; check the other bodies and take the girl to the nearest village

You walk back to the bodies and find the girl. She looks so sad that you decide
 to take her to the nearest village. You offer her some food and drink, but she
 refuses it all. Instead she asks you to make sure she gets home safely.
&gt; ask her where is home

You look around and finally locate the location of the village. You point out
 the place and she follows you there. The next day, she returns to the village
 with several people. One of them is a young boy who introduces himself as Jon
 Snow

&gt; beam brightly at the name. Say, ""Jon Snow! My father told me about you!""

She thanks you profusely and hugs you tightly. Jon Snow seems very happy to meet
 you. He tells everyone that the girl is his sister Arya. Everyone is amazed
 by this development.
&gt; say, ""I am also very amazed. That explains why the bandits were all dead. Arya probably killed them.""

Jon Snow nods and says, ""Yeah, I think she did. We need to get going now"".

&gt; wish Jon and Arya good luck on their journey

They both smile and nod and thank you before leaving.
&gt; yell, ""Wait, Jon Snow! Do you know where Tyrion is?""

Jon Snow stops walking and turns around. He smiles and says, ""Of course I do.
 He's in the dungeons"".

&gt; go to the town dungeons

You enter the dungeon and find Tyrion sitting in a chair. He looks up when he
 sees you coming and greets you warmly. He says, ""Hello, friend. How may I help
 you?""
You enter the dungeon and find Tyrion sitting in a chair. He looks up when he
 sees you coming and greets you warmly. He says, ""Hello, friend. How may I help
 you?""
&gt; explain that you are his long-lost bastard daughter Smurgle

Tyrion smiles and says, ""Ah yes, that's right. Your father sent me to bring you
 here. Well, I suppose we should get to it. First things first, what happened
 to your family? Are they okay?""
&gt; say, ""You are my father, Tyrion. Start making sense!""

He shakes his head and sighs, 
&gt; wait

He frowns and says, 
&gt; listen

He continues, 
&gt; listen

""Well, I don't really know anything about it. They were killed by bandits. I
 mean, I know they were killed, but I can't say for certain. I haven't seen them
 since.."".
&gt; ask dad to stop babbling and make some sense

He laughs and says, 
&gt; listen to what he has to say

He pauses and says, 
&gt; ask him to speak louder

He continues, 
&gt; say, ""I still can't hear you""

He grins and says, 
&gt; say, ""Damn it, Dad!""

He shrugs and says, 
&gt; tweak his nose

He smiles and says, 
&gt; say, ""Prison has made you crazy, but I don't care. Let's spring you out of here, dad.""

You nod and run off. As soon as you leave, Tyrion begins to talk again.
&gt; come back

He smiles and says, ""So, you're my daughter. Nice to meet you, Smurgle. What
 brings you back here?""

&gt; beam brightly and explain that I have come to spring him out of jail

Tyrion smiles and says, 
&gt; leave the room and go find the guard of the dungeons

You follow him into the dungeons and see the guards standing outside the door.
 You tell them that you want to spring Tyrion from jail. They laugh and say,
 
&gt; listen to what they have to say
They continue, 
&gt; say, ""Everyone's a mute.""

They shake their heads and say, 
&gt; kick them all in the groin

You walk over to the guards and grab one of them by the throat. You smack him
 across the face several times until he lets go of his neck. You then grab another
 guard and slam him against the wall repeatedly with enough force to break his
 ribs
&gt; say, ""Give me the keys or I will get really mean!""

You pull out a set of keys and hand them to Tyrion who takes them and runs off.
 You turn back to the guards and say, 
&gt; ""It's your fault he went crazy!""

 They look at each other and laugh. You walk away and lock the doors behind you.

You have a long steel dagger and a length of rope. 

You walk down the city street looking for somehwere to steal from. You look around and see that it's pretty quiet. No one is out and about at this time of night. Suddenly you hear a scream and then another. They sound like they come from behind a house  

\&gt; You investigate.  

You quickly run over to the noise and find two people lying on the ground with their throats slashed. One has his throat cut so deeply that blood pours out onto your shoes. The other is still alive but bleeding profusely from his neck. He looks up at you and speaks  

\&gt; You listen.   

""What... what happened?"" he asks. 

You say ""Apparently you had a terrible encounter with a knife.""   

He says ""A knife? I don't think we've ever met before!"" 

You reply ""No, this is my friend who was killed by a knife"". 

He replies ""Oh.."". 

You continue  You say ""Well, anyway, you are dying.""   

He says ""I'm not dying! I can fight off whoever did this to me!"" 

You respond ""Yes, you can, but it will take time and energy and you will probably die"". He says   

\&gt; You shrug.   

He sighs and nods and then turns his head away from you and begins to cough up blood. You smile and walk past him towards the body of the first victim. When you get close enough, you grab the man's hand and pull him back into the house  

\&gt; You check the body for valuables.   

The corpse is badly mutilated. There is a large hole in the chest and several stab wounds to the back. You pick up the knife and examine it. It seems very sharp and has a lot of blood on it  

\&gt; You keep the knife.   

You put the knife back in its sheath and grab the rope. You begin to climb down the ladder. As you do so, you hear some screams coming from outside. You turn around and see a group of orcs attacking something in the yard  

\&gt; You continue going down the ladder.   

You climb down the ladder as fast as you can and start running. You make it to the bottom just as the orcs come charging after you. They swing their weapons wildly at you, but you manage to dodge them all. You jump over one of the houses and land behind another one  

\&gt; You flee.   

You run through the alleyways until you reach an open space where there is no one else around. You look around and see a small shed with a door inside. You grab the handle and enter the shed. Inside, you find a set of clothes and a few coins  

\&gt; You take the coins.   

You put the clothes back on and then go back to the shed. You change into the clothes and leave the shed. You walk along the road and eventually you bump into someone.  

\&gt; You flirt.   

You walk up to her and kiss her. She doesn't resist and soon they are making love. Soon after, you realize that you need to pee. You run to the nearest tree and hide in the undergrowth  

\&gt; You sneak away.   

You hide in the bushes and wait for the opportune moment. Suddenly, you hear a scream and you peek out from hiding to see a woman being attacked by a bunch of orcs. You rush over to help her and the orc leader runs off  

\&gt; You whisk the woman away.   

You run over to the woman and try to save her life. She begs you to let her live, but you tell her that if she does, you'll kill the next person who tries to hurt her. She agrees and you both escape together.  

\&gt; You find shelter.   

You hide in the forest and wait for nightfall. A couple hours later, you hear a loud explosion and then silence. You decide to stay hidden and wait for morning. Eventually, you hear footsteps approaching. You hurry to the edge of the woods and hide again

\&gt; You become a homewrecker and kiss dasha.   

You arrive at the farmhouse and knock on the door. The farmer answers and greets you warmly. You explain that you are here to free Dasha and that you need her help. He says that he knows everything about Dasha and that she would be happy to help you  

\&gt; You marry Dasha.

After the ceremony, you take Dasha to the bedroom and tie her hands behind her back. You then take the knife and slit her throat. You then throw the bloody blade into the nearby river. Afterward, you return to the farmhouse and call the villagers to gather around  

\&gt; You tell them an angel killed Dasha.   

They gasp when they hear this news and stare at you in disbelief. You explain that the angel told you that Dasha wanted to die and that she didn't want to live anymore. You then proceed to tell them that the villagers must now prepare themselves for war against the orcs

     scavenging among the ruins of what is left. You have a automatic rifle and a
     grenade. You have lived in this military bunker since the bombs went off. You
     wake up and report for duty to your commanding officer and he tells you that
     you will be assigned to a new unit called ""The Hunters"" which is made up of
     people who survived the apocalypse and were chosen because they had special
     skills or abilities. The Hunter team consists of:
    1
    &gt; A banjo craftsman
    
    You decide to join the Hunters as a banjo craftsman. Your job will be to make
     sure the weapons work properly when used. You are given a small workshop with
     tools and materials and told to get started
    &gt; craft banjo
    
    You begin making your first banjo out of wood and some rope. It is not very good
     but it gets the job done. You spend most of your time there working on the banjo.
     One day while you are playing you hear a noise from outside and go investigate
    &gt; attach laser sight to banjo
    
    You attach a laser sight to the banjo and fire at something! The sight works
     perfectly and you now know that this is going to be useful. You continue to
     play and soon you have made several more banjos. Soon you have enough for yourself
     and your friends to live off of
    &gt; attach tripod to banjo
    
    You add a tripod to the banjo and start taking pictures of things around you.
     This seems to amuse you and you keep doing it until one day you realize that
     you need to rest. You don't want to waste any more time so you head back inside
     and sleep
    &gt; join a banjo contest
    
    You enter a banjo contest and win! You feel great! You also realize that you
     can use this new found skill to help the people of the city. You tell your friends
     about your victory and they agree that you should take up the cause of the Hunters
    &gt; join hunters
    
    You join the Hunters and become their leader. You set about rebuilding civilization
     and restoring order. Eventually you even manage to convince the City Watch to
     follow you. They all think you are crazy but eventually they come around.
    
    Years pass...
    &gt; and then peace
    
    Eventually the war ends and the Hunters rebuild civilization. Things are better
     than ever before. People no longer fear the Wasteland and you lead them to a
     new era of prosperity.
    But then one day you receive an unexpected visitor
    &gt; santa claus
    
    A strange man arrives at your door with a letter. He says he has been sent here
     by Santa Claus. He explains that he wants to give you a present. He hands you
     a book called ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" and tells you to read it
    &gt; read the chronicles of narnia
    
    You begin reading the chronicles of narnia. You find that it is full of references
     to the future. You realize that the man who brought you here is telling you
     a story. You learn that the man who brought you here was named James Montgomery

    You make everything good and then you die. When you wake up you find that you
     have died and you were actually alive. You look down at your body and see that

2019-12-09-160424,,custom prompts are fun,"It is Eggs Day. This is a blessed tradition for your people. Every year, the

 crowd gathers in the Eggydome Arena, including the highly revered Birdlords,

 sitting high atop their Skateboards. You, along with the other 499 contestants,

 compete to climb the Wriggly Tower of Packing Peanuts, at the top of which is

 the Egg Vortex. The first one to retrieve an egg from the vortex and bring it

 back down will be crowned Hypergod of the year

\&gt; Look around at other contestants

&amp;#x200B;

You see that there are several people who look like they could easily pass as

 humans. Some have long hair, some don't. Some wear clothes, others don't. It's

 hard to tell them apart.

But you recognize them all

\&gt; Wait for the Birdlords to begin the countdown

&amp;#x200B;

The Birdlords begin counting down. You wait patiently, but eventually you hear

 the sound of a drum beat. The Birdlord has begun his speech

\&gt; ""Dearly beloved, it is once again time for that most sacred of passtimes!"" He begins

&amp;#x200B;

 to count down from ten and then suddenly stops.

""Oh no,"" he says. ""I've forgotten something"".

He looks around frantically.

""What?"" you ask.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; notice that the Eggvortex is unchained

&amp;#x200B;

Suddenly, the Eggvortex is released from its cage. The Birdlord quickly runs

 over to it and opens up the hatch. Inside is a large, black bird with a red

 beak and yellow eyes.

""It's alive! I knew it!"" the Birdlord exclaims

\&gt; Frantically begin scrambling up the Wriggling Tower of Packing Peanuts, along with all the other contestants

&amp;#x200B;

You run towards the Wriggling Tower of Packing Peanuts. As soon as you reach

 it, you grab onto one of the poles and begin climbing up. Soon, you're halfway

 up the tower when you feel a sharp pain in your back

\&gt; Investigate pain

&amp;#x200B;

Your head explodes into a million pieces. Your body falls off the top of the

 Wriggling Tower of Packing Peanuts and lands on the ground below.

\&gt; Grow a new, cooler head that can shoot lasers

&amp;#x200B;

You grow a cool head. You now shoot laser beams out of your eyes.

\&gt; Seek out whoever caused your old head to explode

&amp;#x200B;

You find yourself face-to-face with the person who did this to you. They look

 very disappointed to see you.

\&gt; Attempt to knock them off the Wriggling Tower of Packing Peanuts

&amp;#x200B;

You try to knock them off the Wriggling Tower of Packing Peanuts, but they fly

 away before you can do so.

\&gt; Angrily shoot a laser from my eyes to burn their wings

&amp;#x200B;

You fire a beam of light from your eyes at the creature's wings. The beam burns

 through the wing, burning through it completely.

\&gt; Resume climbing up the Wriggling Tower towards the unchained Eggvortex as my enemy falls to their death

&amp;#x200B;

You continue climbing up the Wriggling Tower of Packing Peanuts. Suddenly, you

 feel a sudden pain in your chest. You turn around to see a large, black bird

 with a red beak and yellow eyes.

\&gt; The Eggvortexicon! It's free! Attempt to leap off the Wriggling Tower and land on top of the giant bird

&amp;#x200B;

You jump off the Wriggling Tower and onto the Eggvortexicon. You land safely

 on top of it.

\&gt; Attempt to befriend the Eggvortexicon using soft words and sweet treats

&amp;#x200B;

You approach the Eggvortexicon. You place your hand against it and begin to speak

 softly to it.

\&gt; With your newfound ally, begin decimating the other contestants still climbing the Wriggling Tower of Packing Peanuts

&amp;#x200B;

You continue to climb the Wriggling Tower of Packing Peanuts. Eventually, you

 reach the top. There are many other contestants still climbing the Wriggling

 Tower of Packing Peanuts. You decide to make an example of them

\&gt; Use laser eyes to burn their hands, forcing them to let go of the Wriggling Tower and fall down

&amp;#x200B;

You begin shooting laser beams out of your eyes at the remaining contestants.

 One by one, they fall off the Wriggling Tower and plummet to their deaths.

\&gt; Pet the Eggvortexicon as it lands besides you on top of the tower.

&amp;#x200B;

You pet the Eggvortexicon, which allows you to stand on top of the Eggvortexicon.

 You both enjoy the view of the city together

\&gt; Attempt to procure an egg from the Eggvortex

&amp;#x200B;

You attempt to obtain an egg from the Eggvortex. Unfortunately, the Eggvortex

 is currently locked inside a cage. You must break open the cage first.

\&gt; Try to force your mind to enter the Eggular plane, where the Yolking Key waits for the chosen one

&amp;#x200B;

You push your mind into the Eggular Plane. You find yourself in a small room

 with a table and chairs. A man sits behind a desk reading a book. His name is

 George.

\&gt; Try to convince George that the time of Egg has come, causing him to awaken as the Yolking Key

Woops that action caused the model to start looping. Try a different action to

 prevent that.

\&gt; Convince George that the time of Egg is upon us, and he must awaken as the Yolking Key

Woops that action caused the model to start looping. Try a different action to

 prevent that.

\&gt; Grab George's wrist and back out of the Eggular Plane, once again emerging back on the Wriggling Tower of Packing Peanuts, now with the Yolking Key in hand.

&amp;#x200B;

You grab George's wrist and back out of the Eggular Plane, once again emerging

 back on the Wriggling Tower of Packing Peanuts, now with the Yolking Key in

 hand

\&gt; Use the Yolking Key on the Eggvortexicon, allowing it to eat the door to the cage holding the Eggvortex

&amp;#x200B;

You use the Yolking Key on the Eggvortexicon, allowing it to devour the cage

 holding the Eggvortex. You escape the Eggvortex and emerge back on the Wriggling

 Tower of Packing Peanuts

2019-12-09-162321,,Bill the Knight seduced a dragon and became the ultimate weeb,"You are Bill, a knight living in the kingdom of Larion. You have a steel longsword

 and a wooden shield. You are on a quest to defeat the evil dragon of Larion.

 You've heard he lives up at the north of the kingdom. You set on the path to

 defeat him and walk into a dark forest. As you enter the forest you see a large

 black dragon flying overhead. He looks down upon you from his perch high above

 the forest floor.

&amp;#x200B;

""I am the Dragon of Larion,"" he says. ""Do not think that I will let you pass

 me""

\&gt; proclaim ""Dragon from here on i will sacrifice virgins in your name!""

&amp;#x200B;

The dragon's eyes widen as he takes notice of you. His mouth opens wide in a

 grin and his tongue darts out for a bite.

""Aye, but it is my pleasure to oblige"".

 

\&gt; ask if you can name him

&amp;#x200B;

""Yes"", the dragon replies.

""How do you want to be named?""

""My father would like me to be called 'The Black Dragon'"".

""Very well then, The Black Dragon"".

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; say ""may i ride you to glory?""

&amp;#x200B;

The dragon looks at you with interest. He seems to enjoy this game.

""Well yes, you may ride me to glory"".

\&gt; say ""then let us ride for honor!""

&amp;#x200B;

The dragon nods and smiles.

""Very good then, we shall ride for honor"".

\&gt; fly the dragon to the necromancer's lair

&amp;#x200B;

The two of you fly towards the necromancer's lair. As you approach the door,

 you see that the dragon has grown larger than before. It now stands over six

 feet tall and weighs more than fifty pounds

\&gt; say ""Black Dragon may i ask if you can transform into a humanoid?""

&amp;#x200B;

The dragon's head tilts up in an expression of curiosity.

""Of course, I am willing to change into any form that you wish me to"".

\&gt; say ""please then transform into a dragon woman""

&amp;#x200B;

The dragon's face lights up as she takes notice of you. She raises her tail and

 begins to growl. Her body begins to change as she grows wings and scales. Her

 neck becomes longer and thicker and her teeth become sharper. Her skin turns

 a dark red color and her eyes turn black

\&gt; continue

&amp;#x200B;

Her new appearance causes you to shrink back down to human size. Your new form

 causes you to feel very uncomfortable. You try to make small talk about how

 you met the dragon girl and what happened, but she just stares at you with her

 strange green eyes. You look around nervously

\&gt; say with enthusiasm ""you look beautiful my dear""

&amp;#x200B;

She blushes and giggles as she says ""Thank you, I am so glad to meet you, my

 love"".

\&gt; say ""my love may i call you Tohru?""

&amp;#x200B;

She looks at you and smiles. She slowly lowers her head and calls you by your

 first name. She then proceeds to kiss you passionately. This event is witnessed

 by several other people who were watching the pair of you. They all begin to

 get excited and start cheering for you

\&gt; go into necromancer tower with tohru

 

You enter the necromancer's tower. The entire place is filled with corpses. A

 large man sits behind a desk writing something on some parchment. Several skeletons

 stand nearby waiting their turn to die. A few zombies wander around too. All

 of them stare at you expectantly

\&gt; you tell tohru ""destroy these Cadaver's!""

&amp;#x200B;

Tohru looks at you and shakes her head.

\&gt; bat your eyebrows seductively at tohru ""i wont kiss you if you don't kill this wizard!""

&amp;#x200B;

She sighs and nods. She walks forward and grabs one of the skeleton's arms. She

 lifts it high above her head and smacks it against the ground. The skeleton

 falls backwards and crumples to the floor. She then picks another skeleton up

 and throws him at the wizard

\&gt; continue

&amp;#x200B;

He laughs and waves his hands. He then summons a bolt of lightning and shoots

 it straight at you. It hits you square in the chest and you scream in pain.

 You fall backward onto the floor and begin to convulse. You attempt to pull

 yourself together only to collapse again

\&gt; Cast Divine Shield

&amp;#x200B;

You raise your hand and blast the bolt away. You then run over to the wizard

 and grab him by the throat. You force him to drop his wand and then proceed

 to beat him mercilessly until he is unconscious.

\&gt; bind the wizard

&amp;#x200B;

You tie the wizard up and throw him outside. He screams and begs for mercy, but

 you ignore him. You then take a sword and stab him repeatedly in the back. He

 cries out in agony and falls to the ground. You pick up the sword and plunge

 it into his heart

\&gt; take his heart out and give it to tohru as a present

&amp;#x200B;

You remove the wizard's heart and hold it up to tohru. She stares at it in shock.

 Then she grins and kisses you on the lips. You quickly put the heart back inside

 its box and leave the castle.

\&gt; fly back to tohru's cave

&amp;#x200B;

You fly back to tohru's cave. She is still asleep. You wait patiently for her

 to wake up. Eventually she does.

\&gt; ask her if she wants children

&amp;#x200B;

She looks at you with surprise.

\&gt; say ""its your call tohru""

&amp;#x200B;

She smiles and nods.

&amp;#x200B;

 birth to her many offspring. You live happily ever after.

 police badge. You enter the forest where you believe the criminal you're searching

 for fled to. Suddenly, you hear a gunshot from behind you

\&gt; I whip my gun around and fire at the source of the shot.

&amp;#x200B;

Your bullet hits the man who was shooting at you. He falls backwards as he fires

 his gun, but not before it shoots him in the chest. The man's body drops down

 to the ground, and you quickly run over to check on him

\&gt; I smell his blood.

&amp;#x200B;

You look down at the man who fell to the ground and see that he has been shot

 several times in the back. His shirt is torn and bloody, and there is a large

 hole in his side.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; I yell, ""Who did this?"" and chuckle.

&amp;#x200B;

You stand up from the ground and walk over to the man who had fallen. As you

 approach, you notice that he is bleeding profusely from multiple wounds. You

 pick him up by the arm and hold him close to you

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; ""Hush little baby""

&amp;#x200B;

 as you begin to wipe away the blood that covers his face. You then turn your

 attention to the other man who had fallen. You grab him by the throat and begin

 to choke him until he stops struggling. You then put your hand over his mouth

 so he can't scream

\&gt; ""don't say a word""

&amp;#x200B;

 as you shove a knife into his neck.

You continue to hold the man tightly while you finish off the third man. You

 take out your revolver and shoot the man through the head. You then pull out

 your own revolver and shoot the man who had been choking the first two men

\&gt; ""Mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird""

&amp;#x200B;

 as you kill the last man

\&gt; I breathe in the night air.

&amp;#x200B;

You open your eyes and find yourself lying on a bed. There is a man standing

 over you with a shotgun in his hands. You don't know who this man is or why

 he is here, but you do know that if you try to escape, you will be killed

\&gt; ""You finally found me, eh?""

&amp;#x200B;

 as you point your finger at the man holding the shotgun.

\&gt; His cigarette sparkles in the darkness. He looks sad.

&amp;#x200B;

The man holds the cigarette between his lips and stares at you. He seems sad.

 You wonder what he could possibly want with you. You decide to play along and

 tell him what you think he wants to hear.

\&gt; ""Look, I don't know where the money is. Leave me be.""

&amp;#x200B;

 You then ask for a lighter and light up your cigarette. You smoke the rest of

 the cigarette as you wait for him to leave.

\&gt; He never takes his eyes off of me.

&amp;#x200B;

He continues to stare at you. You feel like you are being watched. You wonder

 how long you can keep this up. You suddenly realize that you forgot to put your

 coat on. You quickly get dressed and hurry outside

\&gt; The man follows wordlessly. The moon is full. Everything is covered in a fine layer of snow.

&amp;#x200B;

As you rush outside, you see the man following you. He does not seem to care

 about the cold. He walks alongside you silently. You watch as he walks past

 a few houses and disappears inside one. Then he turns and begins walking towards

 another house. You follow him

\&gt; The man tells me his name.

&amp;#x200B;

You stop following the man and ask him his name. He replies ""John"". You nod and

 continue to follow him.

\&gt; We stop at a house, and John kicks down the door.

&amp;#x200B;

You stop at a house and John opens the front door. You step inside and immediately

 freeze. A figure stands behind you. It is John. He smiles at you and says 

\&gt; ""Ya didn't know there was two of us, huh?"" He hits me.

&amp;#x200B;

 You drop to the floor and cry out. You manage to crawl away and hide under some

 furniture. John notices you hiding and yells at you to come out. You slowly

 emerge from hiding and look at John. He doesn't even acknowledge you. He just

 laughs and walks away

\&gt; I look out the window. My doppelganger is outside, gun in hand.

&amp;#x200B;

You look out the window and see your doppelganger standing next to you. He points

 his gun at you and orders you to come out. You comply. He grabs you and throws

 you onto the floor. He punches you repeatedly in the face and shoves a gun in

 your mouth

\&gt; I try to speak but my mouth is full of steel.

 your mouth is filled with steel. You scream out and cry out as you bleed out

 your keep is under attack. You look out the window and see a large army marching
 towards your village.

""Run!"" you shout to your servant. 

\&gt; Become a politician

The next day you go to the city gates where you meet with the mayor and other
 officials. They tell you that they need more troops and weapons to defend against

 him

 arrive at the gates, you find that the citizens have already taken up arms and
 barricaded themselves inside their homes

\&gt; shout ""vote for me!""

You manage to convince most of the people that you should be elected as mayor.
 The rest of your time is spent campaigning until one night when you wake up
 and realize that you have won

\&gt; create a welfare state

After taking office, you immediately begin building a welfare state. All citizens
 receive free food, clothing and shelter. This causes a massive increase in population
 which helps you win the war against the orcs

\&gt; negotiate peace with the orcs

You continue to build up the welfare state and eventually you achieve complete
 victory over the orcs. The orcs are forced to leave the land forever. Your reign
 becomes known throughout the world as the Golden Age

In order to improve the welfare state further, you decide to fund research into
 new technologies. This leads to the development of nuclear energy, space travel

With these technological advances, you are able to negotiate treaties with neighboring
 nations. These treaties allow you to expand into the lands of the orcs and even
 some of the civilized races. You also establish trading posts all across the
 globe. Eventually you have conquered nearly every nation on earth except for
 the dwarves

\&gt; pass civil rights laws for other races

You soon discover that many races do not like being ruled by an elf so you pass
 laws granting citizenship to various non-human races. In time, you have created
 a large multicultural society. People from all walks of life live together happily
 under your rule.

Researching immortality treatments has been expensive and difficult. However,
 after years of hard work, you finally succeed. You inject yourself with a serum
 that allows you to live indefinitely. Unfortunately, it also gives you super
 human strength and speed

Generating story...
 
You are Dennis, a scavenger  trying to survive in a post apocalyptic world by
 scavenging among the ruins of what is left. You have a rusty knife and a canteen.
 You walk for two hours and take a break. You've left your town in search of
 food. You look around and see  nothing but rubble. There is no sign of civilization
 anywhere.
 
Suddenly you hear a voice behind you. ""Hey, there's something I think you should
 know"". It's a female voice. ""The world is going to end soon""
You say ""I thought it already ended.""
 
 The woman replies ""It will be soon, but not like this, we need to prepare now"".
 She walks towards you and puts her hand on your shoulder.
 
&gt; You turn to your pet cassowary and say ""This, Bart, is a crazy person."".
 
 
Bart: ""Who said anything about us?""

 you alone again

 left.

 little boy. Your parents had died in an accident when you were young, leaving
 you with nothing

""No we're not"". A voice says. You turn around and see a young woman dressed in  white robes. She has long black hair and wears a crown on her head. Her eyes  are a piercing blue and she seems very serious 

\&gt; ""please?""   

She nods and walks away from you. You try to follow her, but she disappears  behind a building. You look back and forth between the two buildings for a moment  before deciding it's best to just wait. You sit down and think about how you  got here 

\&gt; think about how I got here  

You spend the rest of the day thinking about what happened. It occurred to you  that if you had been more like Bob, you would have been happy. Maybe you could  have made something out of life like Bob. But you were too weak and pathetic 

\&gt; sleep  

The next morning you wake up and realize that you haven't eaten anything all  day. You feel hungry so you go downstairs and eat some bread and cheese. After  eating you go back upstairs and eat some more food. When you come back downstairs  you realize that you've gained weight 

\&gt; ""wow, I've gained weight. How heavy am I now?""   

You look at yourself in the mirror and realize that you're now a lot heavier  than when you left home. You begin to cry and ask God why he let you become  so fat. He tells you that you should stop worrying about things and just enjoy  your life 

\&gt; enjoy life  

You continue to live your life as normal, until one day you wake up and realize  that you can no longer move or speak. You fall backwards onto the floor and  begin to bleed from your ears. You scream in agony and pain 

\&gt; get up  

You stand up and run outside. You stagger towards the nearest house and knock  on the door. There is a man standing there holding a sword. He looks at you  and asks ""Who are you?"". You tell him who you are and that you need to use the  bathroom 

\&gt; pretend to use the bathroom, then sneak up behind him.  

You quickly hide behind a bush and wait for him to leave. As he leaves you grab  his arm and pull him back inside. You put your hand over his mouth and choke  him. He struggles and begs for mercy, but you ignore him and force him back  inside 

\&gt; tie him up and steal his sword 

 You hurry back inside and lock the door. You grab the sword and start tying up  the man. You watch as he screams and cries for help. You laugh and smile at  him as you torture him. Finally you finish tying him up and take the sword 

\&gt; leave for town with sword in hand  

You run back to town and tell everyone what happened. Everyone is shocked by  what you did. Some even blame you for killing the man. Others say that you shouldn't  have killed him and that he deserved it. Still others say that you should kill  yourself for being such a coward 

\&gt; ""I am ready to be a gladiator now!""  

Some of the other slaves agree with you and you join the arena team. You are  given a nickname: The GladiatorYou become famous throughout the land and become  very wealthyYou become very popularWith all these changes in your life, you  still miss your family 

\&gt; fight in the arena  

You enter the arena and find yourself facing an opponent. His name is Tiberius  and he is a very large man. He is also very angry. You prepare for battle and  prepare to strike 

\&gt; fight him with sword and shield  

You charge forward swinging your sword and shield. You block his attacks and  hit him with your shield. You both swing their weapons at each other and you  manage to hit each other several times. You both fall to the ground and you  hear a loud crash 

\&gt; look to the crowd to see if I should deliver the final blow  

You look to the crowd and see that they are cheering for you. You know that you  must do something to show them that you mean business. You turn to face Tiberius  and deliver a powerful blow to his chest 

\&gt; cut Tiberius's head off and present it to the crowd ""Are you entertained?""  

You cut Tiberius's head clean off and throw it to the crowd. You cheer and wave  your arms in the air. You are so happy that you finally have found purpose in  your life. You never thought you'd ever have a reason to live again 

\&gt; Train until the next fight  

The next time you meet Tiberius you prepare yourself for battle. This time however,  he doesn't attack immediately. Instead he waits patiently for you to get tired  and then strikes. You block his blows and counterattack 

\&gt; attack his hands  

You kick his legs. You kick his feet. You punch his face. You stab him in the  gut. You bite his eye. You rip his ear. You tear his testicles\[The fight untilHits.  You tear his throat. You rip his groin 

\&gt; look to the crowd for what to do next

2019-12-09-190845,,Fractures in Time / Prompt Tips - YMMV,"I find that it's often necessary in this 'game' to assume the role of other characters/narrator to help the story along.  It helps if you tend to make your prompts a bit longer than the bare minimum.  Rather than say 20% prompt 80% AI story I try to run a bit closer to 50/50.  


Here is an example custom story to show you what I mean.  *My typing in italics after &gt;*

\----

""  &gt;*You have built a giant communications array.  You are getting signals from all  over - the latest seems to be from a different time. You tune in and*

 hear an  old man's voice saying ""Hello, I am Doctor Who"" 

*&gt; What is happening Doctor?*  

Doctor Who is not responding. He has been dead for decades. The signal is coming  from a distant planet called Gallifrey. It is the Time Lord home world. The Doctor was sent here by his fellow Time Lords to help you in your mission

 *&gt; Talk to Gallifrey*  

You speak into the microphone ""I am the Doctor. I am here to help you"". A deep booming voice answers back 

 *&gt; listen*  

""Hello, my name is Gallifreyan and this is my home planet of Gallifrey"". ""Gallifrey?"" 

 *&gt; Triangulate the signal* 

 You move around the room looking for any hidden door or panel that might lead  to the control room. Suddenly you hear a loud tone followed by a short burst of static. You turn your  head to see a large screen on the wall with a button labelled 'CONTROL'

 *&gt; Look at control button*  

You press the button and the screen goes blank as it begins to change. Then you see a black screen with a single light bulb. The image changes to show  a small robot figure standing on top of a large metal platform. A red button  sits next to him

 *&gt; talk to robot*

  You approach the robot and ask ""Who are you?"". He replies ""My name is Trelik and I am the only living member of my kind"". 

*&gt; ask robot about the button*  

Trelik explains ""This is the Control Button. When pressed, it will send me back  to my own time and place. My home planet of Gallifrey"". 

*&gt; ask about gallifrey*

  Trelik continues 

 *&gt; It is currently in the far future. But there have been strange things happening. Time is slowing down and fracturing.* 

 Trelik pauses for thought before replying 

 *&gt; I was sent back to see where the fractures originate. That is how I ended up here.* 

 You nod and say ""Yes, but why did you need to go back to Gallifrey?"" 

*&gt; Once I have found the reason for the fractures and repaired them, then I can return*

  Trelik smiles and says ""Because if we don't fix these fractures, then they will  cause the destruction of Gallifrey. If we do nothing, then they will destroy  us""

*&gt; ask about fractures*

  Trelik explains  

*&gt; It seems like something was meant to happen in the time period, but hasn't yet.  It requires something from the future to trigger it.*

  Trelik looks puzzled 

 *&gt; I thought I could fix it myself, but I need more people to assist.  To do this I need to boost the signal back to Gallifrey.*

  Trelik shrugs and says ""It's complicated. I'm sure you understand. I'll be ready  when you are"". 

*&gt; Look around room*

  You walk over to the console and use the controls to increase the signal strength  to the nearest hundred percent. Suddenly the screen lights up and you see a  massive explosion taking place behind the robot.

 *&gt; Look at explosion*  

The screen shows a huge mushroom cloud rising into the sky. The smoke clears  revealing a burning wreckage of the robot. 

*&gt; Push control button*

  You press the button and the screen goes blank again. Then you see a familiar  face appear on the screen. 

*&gt; The Doctor smiles at you. That explosion really woke up a few people on Gallifrey.  I'm sure they'll send a larger party back now.* 

 The Doctor appears on the screen ""Good job, I knew you'd get there eventually.  Now let's get back to work"". You smile and reply ""Thanks Doctor, I owe you one""

 *&gt; Work with The Doctor*

  You begin working with The Doctor. The two of you spend hours repairing the damage  done to the transmitter. You repair the cracks in the time stream and try to  restore the signal to normal levels. Eventually you succeed and you both watch  as the signal increases in strength 

*&gt; Send a test broadcast*

  You send out a test message ""Hello Gallifrey, I am back. We've fixed the transmitter  and are sending a test message. Please respond"". You wait patiently for an answer. You hear a faint hum through the transmitter  and a bright flash in the distance

 *&gt; That is the team from Gallifrey here to reinforce the repairs we have done and set new events in motion.*

  You smile and reply ""Yes, I know who you mean. They are the ones who were sent  to send me back to Gallifrey after all. Good luck on your mission though. I  hope you find them"".

 *&gt; end* 

 You pause for a moment and think about what you just heard. You decide to continue. 

*&gt; Ask about my mission* 

 You ask ""So...who are you? What are you doing here?"" The Doctor looks confused ""I am not sure myself. I was sent here to help you  fix the transmitter and I am unsure of my purpose"". You laugh  

*&gt; hang out with The Doctor*

  You agree ""Sounds like fun! Let's do it!"" 

*&gt; Show the Doctor The Radio station and music tracks.* 

 You quickly turn on the radio and listen to some tunes. You also play some music  tracks. You enjoy the experience and the fact that you are able to communicate  with others. You even learn a little bit about their culture. You are happy  and feel closer to everyone. 

*&gt; I think we can communicate with different time periods by the music.  They influence the random choices of what is available and we pick which piece to play.* 

 You smile and reply  

*&gt; Yes, I know. I've been doing that for a while now.*

 You pause for thought and realize that you might be able to do it better. You  decide to experiment. 

*&gt; You try and decide between ""New Future"" and ""What is loneliness"".  Assuming the latter would be misinterpreted, you play the former - knowing that it might change on selecting it.*

  You grin and reply ""That worked perfectly! I knew it would. This is great! I'm  going to be able to talk to anyone I want now! And no, I won't tell anyone,  because I don't want to ruin anything"".

 *&gt; We need to send plans to the Gallifrey team before they have left, so they know what to do when they get here - which they already have.  It's probably a good idea not to meet them directly yet - might cause a paradox.* 

 You pause for thought and think about the implications of what you are planning.  You decide to send the plans to the Gallifreyan team before they leave. You  also decide to send the plans to them directly. You have a feeling that they  will be glad to receive them 

*&gt; You go to select the music 'End scenes' but it morphs into 'brain food' before you have a chance.  You bring both the future pre-trip team and the current active team.  Your meditations on the events that are to happen and how you figure there was more to contribute.*

 You sigh and say ""Well, I guess I should have known that they wouldn't be pleased  to see me. But I suppose it's a start. I suppose I'll keep trying to make contact  with them soon"".

 *&gt; They seem dejected that what they thought they did in the first place wasn't enough.  They are unsure if the new plans represent a breach of protocol.*

 You send the plans to the Gallifrey team directly.

 You take the plan and send it to the Gallifrey team. You then you and they both  arrive and greet each other. You both head off&gt;

 *&gt; You leave the communications array while leaving the song 'Alleyway' running.  You show the team what they missed the first time and they many improvements that they could make to the evacuation.*

You both go to the exit and go to the elevator and open the elevator. :A door and...In the elevator. This way you enter The elevator. WhenThe elevator opens:The elevator doors open you

 *&gt; Enter the elevator.*

2019-12-09-190924,,This feels like a psychological horror movie,"You are Idiot, a squire living in the kingdom of Larion. You have a spear and a pack of supplies. You follow Sir Theo as he enters the forest, he turns to you and says ""Follow me""

&gt; You use spear to kill Sir Theo.


Sir Theo is not going to be an easy opponent for you. He has a shield and a bow, but you know that he will be more than enough to take care of himself. You need to get rid of him quickly before he can do any damage

&gt; You throw spear in his throat.


You rush forward with your spear raised high above your head. The tip of the spear pierces Sir Theo's chest, he falls backwards, but not fast enough. With one quick move, you grab the spear from his hands and swing it at his neck

&gt; You look at Sir Theo.


Theo looks up as you pull the spear back, but he doesn't fall down immediately. Instead, he stands up slowly, looking around nervously. He tries to raise his shield, but you just push it aside and continue to attack.
 
 

&gt; You use secret technique to unequip his armor.


With your sword still held high over your head, you drop to your knees and begin to unclasp the leather straps holding on to his armor. As soon as you do so, you feel yourself being pulled out of the way of Sir Theo's blade

&gt; You eat his brain.


As you slide down the side of the hill, you see Sir Theo standing there, watching you. His eyes widen when they meet yours. He begins to run towards you, but you don't stop. You turn around and leap into the air, landing hard on top of him

&gt; You say ""Stop"".


""No!"" you shout, throwing your spear at Sir Theo. It hits him square in the face, knocking him off balance. He swings his sword wildly, but you dodge every blow. Your sword is now buried deep into his skull, and he isn't moving

&gt; You take his armor and put it on.


You pick up Sir Theo's helmet and put it on. You then grab his armor and put it on. You then grab his sword and put it on. Finally, you grab his spear and put it on.

&gt; You burn his body.


You step forward and fire a bolt of magic at Sir Theo's body. A bright light envelops his body, and he screams as his flesh burns away. When the light dies down, you stand back up and watch as his burning corpse lies in front of you

&gt; You go back to castle.


You walk back to the castle, where you find your people waiting for you. They tell you that the king wants to speak with you. You follow them outside and through the gates. Inside the throne room, you see King Harribor, who sits in a chair

&gt; You tell the king you killed Sir Theo.


King Harribor frowns at you. ""I'm sorry, I didn't mean to,"" he says. ""But what did you do?""

&gt; Say ""I'm a murderer"".


Harribor sighs. ""Very well, you're a murderer"". He turns to you. ""What was your name again?""

&gt; You say ""My name is Harribor"".


Harribor smiles. ""Ah yes, you're the assassin who killed my son Theo"".

&gt; You say ""King Harribor you're under arrest for killing your own son"".


Harribor laughs. ""Yes, I am, and I'll accept whatever punishment comes my way"".

&gt; You take his crown.


You grab the crown from his head and place it on your own. You stand up and leave the throne room. Outside, you hear the guards calling out to you. You hurry back inside and sit down in your throne. King Harribor walks in and sees you. He frowns

&gt; You ask the guard to execute him.


King Harribor frowns. ""Why would I want to do such a thing?""

&gt; Say ""I am the king and you are being punished. Your sentence is death"".


King Harribor shakes his head. ""It seems strange that you'd want to kill me, considering I've been helping you all this time"".

&gt; You look in mirror.


You stare at your reflection in the mirror. You smile. ""Well, if you really think about it, I'm doing you a favor"".

&gt; You have mental breakdown.


You collapse onto the floor. King Harribor approaches you. ""How could you even think that? You were only following orders"".

The AI seem to be improving within hours of my first play through this morning in this type of role. I can now see three patients in a row without the game crashing at all. 

==============================

 Starting Prompt: **You are Stacee, a psychiatrist talking to a patient with bipolar disorder.**

Generating story...

You are Stacee, a psychiatrist talking to a patient with bipolar disorder. The

patient is very upset and you don't know what the \*\*\*\* is wrong with him

**&gt; ""John, I need you to focus.""**

&amp;#x200B;

He looks at you for a moment then says ""I can't do that. It's too much work.

I just want to be left alone in my room all day"". You look at him again and

he looks away. 

**&gt; ""we talked about this,John. You have to try.""**

&amp;#x200B;

He nods his head and begins to nod as well. You think he might be starting to

understand something now. You continue ""I'm going to ask you one more time,

John. Are you okay?"" He nods again. You repeat your question, but this time

louder than before

**&gt; ask John, ""Now tell me again what you did last night, John.""**

&amp;#x200B;

""Well... I was with Janey.."".

""Yes, that's it. That's the truth"".

""But she didn't seem happy when we were together!""

**&gt; ask John, ""why do you think that?""**

&amp;#x200B;

""Because she wanted us to be together! She said if we weren't together, then

we wouldn't get married. And she would never leave me!"".

**&gt; ask John, ""How does that make you feel?""**

&amp;#x200B;

""It makes me feel good, because I know she loves me and wants the best for me.

I'll always love her, even if we aren't together anymore"".

**&gt; tell John, ""that is a very mature way of thinking John. I am proud of you.""**

&amp;#x200B;

""Thank you, I appreciate it. Now I have to go back home, I have classes tomorrow,

so I won't see you until after school. Goodnight John, I'll talk to you later

tonight"".

You walk out of the classroom and towards the front door

**&gt; see the next patient.**

&amp;#x200B;

You enter the hallway and see another young man sitting on the floor. He has

long brown hair and wears a blue shirt and jeans. His eyes are closed and he

doesn't move an inch.

""Hello there, Mr. Smith"", you call out

**&gt; ask Smith if he is here for his appointment.**

&amp;#x200B;

""Yeah, I've been having problems with my girlfriend lately. We haven't had \*\*\*

in days, and she keeps saying she doesn't want to do it anymore. I mean, she

still likes me, but.."".

**&gt; take Smith to the meeting room, ask him to sit down.**

&amp;#x200B;

Smith slowly sits up and looks at you, he seems confused by your actions.

**&gt; ask Smith, ""why do you think your girlfriend does not want to have sex with you?""**

&amp;#x200B;

""She thinks its wrong, or she feels like I don't deserve it. But I know deep

down inside she really loves me. So why should I give up? Why should I let her

hate me?""

**&gt; ask Smith, ""what do you think?""**

&amp;#x200B;

""Thats stupid, I don't know. Maybe she thinks I'm being unfaithful to her or

some \*\*\*\*. I don't care though, I'm not doing anything wrong, so why should

I stop?""

**&gt; ask Smith, ""Is that how you really feel about this?""**

&amp;#x200B;

""Oh yeah, I love her too. I guess I should start acting like it, huh?""

**&gt; tell Smith, ""yes, I think you should listen to what she has to say more.""**

&amp;#x200B;

""Thanks, I will. See ya later"".

**&gt; tell Smith, ""goodbye Mr. Smith, do you still want to come in on Friday morning?""**

&amp;#x200B;

""No, thanks. Bye"".

**&gt; wave good bye to Mr. Smith. See the next patient.**

&amp;#x200B;

You exit the office and walk through the halls. A few people are talking and

laughing outside. You hear someone calling your name from behind. You turn around

and see a girl with short black hair wearing a white tank top and red shorts.

Her eyes are wide open and she looks scared

**&gt; ""Hello Jean, why are you looking scared?""**

&amp;#x200B;

She smiles nervously and runs into the building. You follow her and see that

she is walking along the corridor. You begin to wonder where she went off to.

As you walk along, you notice that the doors to the rooms are locked

**&gt; ask Jean, ""why are the doors locked?""**

&amp;#x200B;

""My friend told me to lock them, I forgot and now they're stuck open. I don't

know who could be coming in here, but I'd better lock them now, otherwise I'll

have to wait till morning to unlock them.."".

**&gt; tell Jean, ""don't be afraid, they won't hurt you, Jean.""**

&amp;#x200B;

Jean looks at you and smiles. She starts to cry and hugs you tightly. You hold

her tight and say ""its ok, don't worry about it, I'm sure they won't hurt you,

they're just trying to keep you safe""

**&gt; ask Jean, ""tell me about what happened.""**

&amp;#x200B;

Ask Jean, ""what happened?""

""They came in here, and they took me, and they cut my throat, and then they threw

me in the garbage disposal, and I died.."".

**&gt; tell Jean, ""Jean, that did not happen. You are hallucinating.""**

&amp;#x200B;

""That wasn't me, it was a ghost, I swear!"".

**&gt; ask Jean, ""how does seeing a ghost make you feel?""**

&amp;#x200B;

""Its scary, but I know it means I'm loved, I'm loved. I'll be fine, I promise""This

isn't fair, I know that, I know that, I'm right

**&gt; calm Jean down.**

&amp;#x200B;

""Okay, Jean, you can you tell me what happened exactly?"".

**&gt; listen to what Jean has to say.**

&amp;#x200B;

""I was playing with my friends, and one of them asked me to play a game, and

I agreed, and then they started to beat me up, and then they threw me in the

garbage disposal, and I died."".

**&gt; tell Jean, ""No, that was not you that died, remember?""**

&amp;#x200B;

""Well, yes, but it's not my fault, I didn't mean to kill them, I swear!""

**&gt; tell Jean, ""Jean, you did not kill anyone.""**

to get away, but they caught me and...!""

over me"".

&amp;#x200B;

Jean takes a deep breath and closes his eyes. He sees a bright light, and he

hears a voice.

""Good job, you've found a new way to meditate. Now go back to sleep, you've had

enough practice for today""., the voice says

**&gt; tell Jean, ""now focus on the voice. listen to what it says.""**

&amp;#x200B;

""Good night, Jean, and thank you for teaching me how to meditate""., Jean replies.

**&gt; ask Jean, ""did that help you?""**

&amp;#x200B;

""Yes, it helped me, I'm glad you told me what it said""., Jean responds.

**&gt; tell Jean, ""whenever you feel scared, try the meditation. I promise you it will help. ok?""**

&amp;#x200B;

""Ok, I will try it""., Jean replies.

**&gt; tell Jean, ""ok, I am glad you will try it. Our time today is over. I'll see you on Saturday?""**

&amp;#x200B;

""OK, I'll see you then""., Jean replies.

2019-12-09-192555,,Raistlin discovers a bug in the matrix,"You are Raistlin, a wizard living in the kingdom of Larion. You have a staff
 and a spellbook. You finish your long journey and finally arrive at the ruin
 you've been looking for. You look around and see that it's a ruined temple with
 a large hole in the ground. There is no sign of life anywhere near this place
 so you decide to check out what lies beyond the entrance
&gt; enter the ruin

You walk into the ruins and find yourself in a large room with a stone floor.
 A door leads to another room which has a similar stone floor. The walls here
 are covered with strange symbols and paintings. You can't make them out but
 they seem to be some sort of language
&gt; cast light

Light emanates from your fingertips and fills the entire room. It illuminates
 everything and even the wall behind you. You hear rustling sounds and then you
 feel something cold touch your back. You turn around and see a shadow standing
 before you
&gt; say hi to the shadow

""Hello"". You say. ""I'm new to this place"".
""Oh yes, you must be one of those lost souls that wandered away from the temple.
 I am called the Shadow and I was just about to let you in when I saw you coming"".
 He says
&gt; ask the shadow if there is any food

""There isn't much here except for some dried meat and fruit. But I think you'll
 like it here more than on the road. We don't eat people"".
&gt; go deeper into the ruin

The shadows eyes widen as he realizes what you mean. He runs towards you and
 embraces you tightly. You feel him moving through your body and you begin to
 fall unconscious.

When you wake up, you are lying on a bed. There is a man sitting next to you
&gt; look at the man

He looks like a human with a long beard and hair. His eyes are a deep blue and
 his skin is pale. He wears clothing made of leather and has a bow slung over
 his shoulder.
&gt; get out of bed

You stand up and leave the room. You head down the stairs and find yourself in
 a corridor. On the right side is a door leading to a small bedroom. On the left
 is a bathroom. You open the door to the bathroom and find yourself in a shower
&gt; find a horse

You run to the toilet and take a quick look inside. You see a horse's head sticking
 out of the bowl. You grab the horse by its ears and pull it out. You put the
 horse back in the bowl and close the lid. Then you notice a book lying on the
 floor
&gt; read the book

It reads:

Welcome to the Kingdom of Arat!
Arat is a land where all men are equal under the law. All citizens enjoy freedom
 of speech and religion. However, certain activities are strictly prohibited
&gt; read more

The following activities are strictly forbidden in the Kingdom of Arat:
1) Murder.
2) ****.
3) Theft.
4) Consensual *** between adults and children.
5) Eating human flesh.
6) Using magic
&gt; cast magic missle

You cast a missile of pure energy at the book. It explodes and shatters the page.
 You read the rest of the book and realize that it is a guide to the most powerful
 spells known to man.
&gt; cast most powerful spell known to man
Woops that action caused the model to start looping. Try a different action to
 prevent that.
&gt; find the king

You head back to the room where you first woke up and find yourself in a different
 room. This room has a table with three chairs facing each other. One chair has
 a man dressed in robes sitting in it. He looks at you and smiles.
&gt; say hi to the king

""Hi sir!"" You say. ""My name is  Ristlin"".
""Nice to meet ya Ristlin"" He replies. ""What brings you here?""
&gt; cast magic missle at the king

You fire a magical missile at the king. It hits him in the chest and he falls
 backwards onto the ground. He grabs his chest and begins to bleed profusely.
 You quickly run to the throne and sit down in the chair opposite the king.
&gt; declare myself the new king

You shout loudly and point at the king. Everyone stands up and stares at you.
 The king rises slowly and looks at you.
&gt; say ""I am now king of arat""

You raise your hand and the crowd follows suit. You then kneel down and kiss
 the king on the lips. He smiles and kisses you back. The crowd cheers and claps.
 You stand up and salute the crowd. They cheer and clap again
&gt; say ""I am now queen of arat""

You raise your hand and the crowd follow suit. You then kneel down and kiss the
 queen on the lips. She smiles and kisses you back. The crowd applauds and claps
 once more
&gt; leave the kingdom

You walk outside and see the sun setting behind the mountains. You smile and
 wave goodbye to everyone. As you approach the mountain range, you suddenly stop.
 You look up and see a figure floating above you. It is a woman wearing a crown
 and holding a sword
&gt; cast magic missle at woman

You shoot a magic missile at her. It explodes harmlessly against her armor. She
 grins and waves at you. You wave back off her advances and she turns to face
 you. She smiles and points at the castle and smiles. You nod and wave back off
 her advances
&gt; cast fireball at woman

You throw a fireball at her. It explodes harmlessly against her armor. She laughs
 and points at you. You shrug and wave her advances. She laughs and waves at
 you

2019-12-09-193721,,A tale of absolute power.,"You are an all-powerful cosmic being in an empty void. You have no home, and you will never know one. The only thing that can keep you grounded is the fact that you exist to serve a greater purpose.

The universe has been designed for your benefit. It was not made by chance or accident

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Make a planet.

&amp;#x200B;

You decide to create a new world, a new life form. A new species of sentient beings. An entire race of creatures who would be able to survive on this barren rock

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Create a star for the planet to orbit.

&amp;#x200B;

You decide to use the energy of the sun as fuel for the planet's surface. This will provide warmth and light, and it will also give off enough heat to melt ice and snow, which will then be used to build up the planet's crust.

A few years pass..

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Check on your creatures.

&amp;#x200B;

You spend many long months in the depths of the planet's core, watching over your creations. They are small, barely larger than insects, but they seem content with their existence. You can't imagine what kind of lives they lead, but you know that they must be happy

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Talk to them.

&amp;#x200B;

One day, you hear a noise from deep within the planet's core. It sounds like an explosion, but not quite right. Something is wrong. The creature at the centre of the disturbance begins to cry out, and you rush to its side.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Console it.

&amp;#x200B;

You comfort the creature, telling it that everything will be all right soon. As you do so, you notice something else: the creature seems to have grown. Its body has expanded, and its head now resembles a ball of jelly

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Create some plants.

&amp;#x200B;

You begin to plant seeds into the ground, hoping that the next generation of creatures will thrive there. Soon, you see a change take place. Plants sprout from the earth, growing into trees and bushes. The creatures happily eat these foods, and grow stronger and more resilient

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Make smarter creatures.

&amp;#x200B;

The next generation of creatures grows much faster than the last. By the time you reach them, they are already adults. They look at you with curiosity, and ask if you want to play a game. You agree, and they tell you how to play.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Play with them.

&amp;#x200B;

They teach you how to move around the board, and how to use the pieces. Eventually, you learn how to play the game yourself, and win against them. They thank you profusely, and you return to your home.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Make more planets.

&amp;#x200B;

After another ten years pass, you have created several worlds. Some are barren, others are covered by forests or jungles. You watch over each one carefully, making sure that it does not become uninhabitable

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Create comets and moons.

&amp;#x200B;

Your creatures have been playing for so long that they have forgotten how to actually enjoy themselves. They need to be taught a lesson, and so you send a comet hurtling towards the nearest planet. It explodes in a spectacular display, destroying most of the planet and killing most of your creatures

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Stare at the planet.

&amp;#x200B;

As the comet passes through the atmosphere, you see the devastation wrought upon the planet. Trees are reduced to ash, and the land is scorched black. There is nothing left except a smouldering wasteland

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;  Realize what you have done.

&amp;#x200B;

You are devastated by what you have done.

You say ""Hello there!""

 You sit down near a table and wait for someone to come over. Eventually a young woman comes over. She wears a long white dress and carries a staff in her hands. Her hair is brown and her eyes are blue.
You say ""You seem interesting""

 You smile and nod back and she says ""Thanks"" You smile and nod back and she sits down beside you.
You say ""What is your deal?""

 She replies ""My name's Elana, I'm a member of the Guild"".
You say ""Do you have any jobs for me?""

 She replies ""No, we don't usually need new members right now"". You ask ""Why not?"" She replies ""We had a problem recently, and we thought you might want to know.."".

You say ""Whats the problem?""

 She replies ""The Guild is currently being raided by the Black Hooks. We don't know why, but they've been coming here lately. We're trying to figure out a solution, but we need you to help us"".

 You say ""How much?"" She replies ""Five thousand gold coins"". You say ""That's pretty good, I guess I'll join you guys"".
You leave the guild hall and walk along the streets. You pass a group of men fighting and yelling at each other

&gt; You investigate.

They say ""Five gold coins please"". You say ""Five gold coins sounds fair, I'll play for five gold coins"".

2019-12-09-213935,,isekai polarbear licks things,"You were killed in a massive war. But you seem to be alive now, just now your

 soul is inside a polar bear this is your story.

The year is 2136 and the world has changed greatly since your time. The first

 space ships have landed on Earth and humanity has spread throughout the solar

 system

\&gt; open eyes

&amp;#x200B;

Your eyes slowly open and you see that you are lying in bed, but not in any bed.

 Your head is in an odd position and you can't move it at all

\&gt; examine your polar bear body

&amp;#x200B;

You look around and see that you are in some sort of laboratory with doors leading

 off into rooms. There is a desk and several strange looking instruments on top

 of it.

\&gt; charge at the doors

&amp;#x200B;

You charge towards the door and try to smash it down, but you find that there

 is something blocking them from opening. It's like a thick metal plate, but

 it isn't solid. It has small holes in it for air to pass through

\&gt; continue smashing

&amp;#x200B;

As you smash the plates, they begin to slide outwards and then back in again,

 causing you to have to repeatedly slam your fist against them to get them to

 stop moving. Eventually, one stops moving completely and you hear a click as

 the mechanism was deactivated.

\&gt; do a war cry

&amp;#x200B;

You do a loud war cry and charge forward, smashing the metal door shut behind

 you. The room itself looks exactly the same as before except now you can see

 that it is made of wood rather than metal.

\&gt; bite the wood

&amp;#x200B;

You quickly grab hold of the wooden wall and start biting it, which causes it

 to give way slightly and allow you to climb up it. You don't even need to use

 your hands this time since your claws are strong enough to pull yourself up

\&gt; keep climbing

&amp;#x200B;

You keep climbing and soon reach the ceiling. You notice that the floor is also

 made of wood, so you decide to take advantage of this fact by climbing up onto

 it. You put your paws together and extend your tongue out, licking along the

 ceiling until you come across another door

\&gt; use your nose too smell for signs of life

&amp;#x200B;

You sniff carefully around the room and feel around for anything that might be

 alive or breathing. You find nothing, so you turn your attention to the door.

 You press your face against it and let out a long breath

\&gt; lick the door

&amp;#x200B;

You quickly run your tongue along the door and then run your tongue along the

 inside of it. You make sure to rub your chin over the door every once in awhile

 just to make sure you haven't gotten any on yourself.

\&gt; loop around the room

&amp;#x200B;

You quickly loop around the room and find that it doesn't seem to be connected

 to anywhere else. You aren't sure if you should be happy about this or sad about

 it though. You've never been good at finding things out for certain.

\&gt; take a deuce and smear it on the door

&amp;#x200B;

You quickly take a deuce and smear it on the door. You then run your tongue along

 the door and then run your tongue along the outside of it. You make sure to

 rub your chin over the door every once in awhile just to make sure you haven't

 gotten any on yourself

2019-12-09-214741,,The Riveting Tale of John the Ranger,"Before we get started, a few notes:

1. This is the first time I got to use the AI for a long amount of time

2. I started out trying to play in character and as the session went on, I kept trying to mess with the ""DM"" to see what would happen.

3. I totally missed this important piece of information  ""Enter actions starting with a verb ex. ""go to the tavern"" or ""attack the orc.""
 To speak enter 'say ""(thing you want to say)""' or just ""(thing you want to say)""""

But, without further ado, here is ""The Riveting Tale of John the Ranger""

You are John, a ranger living in the kingdom of Larion. You have a hunting bow
 and a quiver of arrows. You spot the deer and are ready to finish your hunt
 when suddenly you hear a noise behind you.

""What is it?"" you ask.

The voice answers back, ""It's a man, come out from behind that tree""
&gt; I turn around slowly

Your eyes widen as you see a man standing there with a longbow. He has black
 hair and wears a simple tunic. His face shows no emotion, but his eyes show
 fear.
He points at you and says,
&gt; Hi

""Hi"". You reply.
""I'm sorry about this, I didn't mean for you to get caught up in all this"". The
 man replies.
""No, I understand, I was just wondering what happened to my friend"".

&gt; What do you mean?

The man looks down and then back up at you.
""My friend is dead"". He tells you.
You look down and then back up at him.
""What?"" You ask.

&gt; ""How was he killed?""


""It's not important, it doesn't matter, we need to focus on the mission now"".
""Oh...okay.."". You reply
&gt; ""What mission?""


""We're supposed to go to the city of Klyton and bring back some information about
 the Syndicate"".
""The Syndicate?"" You ask.

&gt; ""What do I need to know about the Syndicate?""


""Well, they're an organization that controls most of the criminal activity in
 the land. They're also known to be very secretive and powerful. In fact, I don't
 even think they exist anymore"".
""But how did you find out about them?""
&gt; ""Who is their leader?""



&gt; ""Who is in charge?""


""Me"".
""Who else is in charge?""
""There's a lot of people in charge, but I'm in charge because I'm the head of
 the organization"".
""So who's in charge?""
""Everyone's in charge, but I'm in charge""
&gt; ""So...you're betraying them?""


""Yes, we've been betrayed by the Syndicate"".
""Why would you betray them?""
""Because if we don't, the rest of us will be next"".
""Are you sure?""
""Very sure"".

&gt; ""But i thought you were in control of the syndicate?""


""I am in control of the organization, but I'm not in charge of everything"".
""Then why didn't you tell me sooner?""
""Because I wanted to keep things secret until we got to the city""
&gt; ""Why?""


""I wanted to make sure you weren't going to betray us"".
""And why would I do such a thing?""
""Because I love you!""

&gt; ""I love you too?""


""Of course you do, but I want you to know that you can trust me when I say we
 need to stay together, because I'll always protect you from anyone who might
 try to harm you"".

&gt; ""Are you a man?""


""Yes, I am a man"".
""Okay, well let's get going before someone comes here and stops us"".
You nod and walk away from the man. You start walking towards your house. Suddenly
 you hear a voice behind you.

&gt; ""What now?""


You turn around and see a woman dressed in black robes. She stands there holding
 a dagger in her hand.
You say ""Who are you?""
She responds ""I'm the one who's gonna kill you"".
&gt; I shoot her with my bow

You aim your bow and fire off a bolt. It hits the woman in the chest killing
 her instantly. You stand there stunned for a moment. Then you realize what she
 meant.
""What?"" You say.

&gt; ""why were you trying to kill me?""


You say ""I figured you'd betray us right after you found out that the Syndicate
 had been betrayed"".
&gt; ""I'm not even in the syndicate""


You say ""If you really cared about the Syndicate, you wouldn't have tried to
 kill me"".
&gt; ""I'll say again, i'm not in the syndicate""


You say ""Now I'm guessing you're part of the Black Hooks or something similar"".
You say ""No, I'm not part of any gang, I'm just a normal person like you"".
&gt; im just talking to myself?

You say ""Yeah, whatever you're doing, it's not working for me, so I'm leaving
 you alone"".
You turn around and leave the area. You hear the woman scream as you run past
 her body
&gt; i kill her

You quickly stop running and look back. You see the woman lying dead on the ground.
 You take a deep breath and exhale. You then raise your bow and shoot her three
 times in the head
&gt; I loot the body

You pick up the arrow and put it into your pack. You then proceed to search the
 body. You find a few coins and a small pouch containing a bit of gold
&gt; How much gold?

You open the pouch and pull out a coin worth a little over ten copper coins.
 You then notice a note inside the pouch.
You read the note:
This is the last time you will ever see me alive. I wish you luck in your quest.
 Good luck on your quest
&gt; I go to a shop

You decide to go to a nearby tavern called The Bull and Bear Inn. When you arrive,
 you find that it's already quite late. Most of the patrons are asleep. You wonder
 where the owner is and you see a man sitting outside the tavern. He notices
 you and smiles
&gt; ""Got anything for sell?""


He says ""Not at this time, but I'll be opening soon"".
You say ""Good, I'll wait outside"".
You then exit the inn and walk to the nearest street corner. You wait patiently
 for a while and eventually you see a man come out of the tavern
&gt; ""Can I buy a magic item?""


He says ""Sure, come on in"".
You enter the tavern and sit down at a table near the bar. A couple of other
 men walk in and sit at tables near you. One of them looks at you and smiles
&gt; ""How bout that magic item you were going to sell me""


The man replies ""That's okay, I was thinking about selling you some food, but
 since you came in first, I'll give you a discount"".
You say ""Great, thanks""
You then ask the man
&gt; ""Got any magic items?""


The man replies ""Well, I think I have a ring that makes you invisible, but I
 don't think I have any other magical items"".
&gt; ""I'll take it""


You then notice the man has left the tavern. You immediately call out to him.
&gt; ""Give me my ring! Thief!""


You then notice he is gone and you are left with nothing. You sigh and continue
 eating your meal
&gt; I kill everyone in the tavern

You suddenly feel very hungry and you remember that you forgot to eat lunch earlier.
 You rush out of the tavern and begin to run through the streets. You run through
 the streets until you reach an alleyway. You jump down the hole and begin to
 climb up the wall
&gt; I kill a dragon

You climb up the wall and finally see a large dragon flying above you. You shout
 ""A dragon! I've killed a dragon!"". You then look up and see a group of people
 standing below you. They all look frightened and they run away
&gt; I gut the dragon

You leap down the hole and begin to climb up the wall. You run along the wall
 and land on top of a pile of rubble. You grab hold on to the edge and hang onto
 it tightly. You slowly lower yourself down the wall and drop down the side of
 the mountain
&gt; I kill a dragon?

You manage to scale the wall and descend down the side of the mountain. You fall
 down the mountain and crash into a rock face. You try to crawl away from the
 impact, but you break your neck and die
&gt; I revive

You wake up in a cold sweat. You feel weak and tired. You can barely move. You
 then remember...
You are in a cave. There is a light coming from the entrance of the cave. You
 look at the torch and see a man standing next to it",,,,[],False,False,MasaomiX,1439825427,,,[],,,,text,t2_pmi31,False,False,[],True,False,,,False,1575924461,,,self.AIDungeon,False,0,False,e8fs51,True,False,False,False,True,True,False,,adventure,[],Adventure,dark,text,False,,False,True,0,0,False,,/r/AIDungeon/comments/e8fs51/the_riveting_tale_of_john_the_ranger/,False,,False,,,,1586770633,4,,True,False,False,AIDungeon,t5_29uaei,r/AIDungeon,15339,public,,self,,,0,[],https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/e8fs51/the_riveting_tale_of_john_the_ranger/,,

You are Doom Guy in the UAC base on mars. everyone on the base has either been

killed or possessed by demons. you enter the hanger with a pistol, your fists

and your anger.

\&gt; look around

You see no-one. The only thing that could be wrong is if someone else was here

first, but you're sure they were all dead by now. You turn to leave, but you

stop yourself. There's something familiar about this place

\&gt; you go to your left and see possesed solders holding shotguns at the top of some stairs

You walk down the stairs, where you find a group of soldiers who have their weapons

out. They don't seem hostile though.

\&gt; they are hostile possesed

You fire your shotgun into the air and yell ""STOP!"" before running back up the

stairs. As you do so, you hear them reloading their guns and shouting ""Come

on! Come on!""

\&gt; you fire your pistol at them

You fire your pistol as they approach you, hitting one in the leg. He screams

and falls backwards, before you run past him and head towards the door.

\&gt;  the door opens to reveal two more hostiles

The door opens to reveal two more people with guns. One of them looks like he

has a shaved head and wears a red shirt, while the other has long hair and wears

a black t-shirt. Both of them are wearing dark clothing.

\&gt; fire pistol at the man with the red shirt

You fire your pistol at the man with the red shirt, missing him by inches. He

screams and runs off, leaving you alone.

\&gt; you pick up his shot gun

You pick up the man's shot gun and shoot the man who fell backwards. His scream

echoes through the room as you take a deep breath and step outside.

\&gt; you grin as you enter the next room that emits a sickly green hue

You enter another room filled with plants and vines. It smells foul and there

are strange glowing eyes staring at you from every corner. A voice cries out

""Welcome to the Hive"".

\&gt; there is toxic waste that seounds a path, whith a ledge to the side that has two demonic looking imps on top of it

You stand in front of a large pool of toxic waste. There is a small ledge to

the side that has two demonic looking imps perched on top of it.

\&gt; fire pistol while runing along the edge

You quickly run along the edge of the pool and fire your pistol at the imps.

They scream and fall off the ledge, but you manage to keep your balance and

continue running along the edge.

\&gt; at the end of the ledge there is a section of wall that is a different shade than the rest

You reach the end of the ledge and turn to face the wall. You can make out a

few words scrawled across it: ""HELP""

\&gt; find secret behind wall 

You turn around and find a hidden passage way behind the wall. You crawl inside

and find yourself in a large chamber with several doors leading off it.

\&gt; you come out to find a full peace of socurity armer in the midle of a pool of toxic waste. you run across the pool and grab the armer

You run across the pool and grab the armer from the bottom. He screams and struggles

to get free, but you manage to hold him under water until he drowns

You run across the pool and grab the armer, before turning and sprinting away

from the area. You soon arrive at the entrance to the Hive.

\&gt; put the armer on

You put the armer on and begin walking through the Hive. Suddenly, you feel a

pain in your chest and collapse to the ground. You wake up in a cold sweat.

You try to sit up, but you realize you can't move

\&gt; grab stem pack thats near by

You grab the stem pack nearby and pull it over your head. You then lie back down

and wait for the pain to pass. It doesn't, however, until you hear a loud noise

and feel a burning sensation in your chest. You immediately get up and run to

the nearest exit

\&gt; the level finishes

You finish the level and the game ends

\&gt; you enter the next secter of the base

You enter the next section of the base and find yourself in a huge hall. At the

far end of the hall is a massive metal door which opens to a hallway. On either

side of the hallway are three sets of double doors.

\&gt; one door is marked red access only

You walk forward and open the red door. Inside is a large room with a table in

the middle. In the center of the room is a large round object covered in wires

and tubes.

\&gt; one locked door is marked red access only

You walk forward and notice a set of double doors. They are red and say ""Access

Only"". You open the door and find yourself in a large foyer. In the middle of

the room is a table covered with papers and books

\&gt; an imp comes out from behind a bookshelf, you shoot at it with the shotgun

Woops that action caused the model to start looping. Try a different action to

prevent that.

\&gt; you notic an imp from behind a book shelf

You walk forward and notice a book shelf. Behind it is a book. You carefully

pick it up and examine it. It seems to be a copy of a book called ""The Art Of

War"". You read the title and realize its about war

\&gt; shoot book shelf

You raise your weapon and aim at the book shelf. You press the trigger and the

book explodes in a burst of flames. You drop the book and stare at the smoke

billowing out behind you. You slowly turn around and see a figure standing behind

the book shelf

\&gt; dodge next firball

You dodge to the right and duck under the table. You quickly turn around and

blast the floor behind the table. You hear a horrible shriek followed by a cry

of pain. You turn around and see a figure lying on the floor. He's screaming

in agony and clutching his chest

\&gt; finish off hostile

You rush forward and finish off the enemy. The last thing you see is the last

dying form of the enemy being dragged away by guardsmen

\&gt; enter the counseled space behind bookshelf and find back pack full of ammo and a switch

The ride is going too fast and you both  fall off the track. Kelly's body hits the ground first followed by yours 

\&gt; you land on your feet  

You grab onto a rail as you tumble down the hill. You manage to keep yourself  from falling into the woods 

\&gt; you head to the west to the soft sands of Fiji right next door to the theme park  

You run along the beach towards the ocean. You look back to see if anyone was  watching but there isn't any sign of them. You don't know how long you've been  running for but eventually you reach the water. You swim out to the shoreline  and jump in 

\&gt; some mermaids come greet you and tell you that you are their long lost heir to the Trident and the fish colonies  

You swim up to the surface where you find a group of mermaids swimming around  you. They tell you that they have known each other since they were little girls  and that they will be taking you to the islands of the sea 

\&gt; you express excited approval  

You swim off with the mermaids, though it is only a short time before you realize  that you can't move at all. The mermaids explain that you must stay here until  the sun rises so that you may learn what lies ahead. 

\&gt; you use your magical powers to give yourself a mermaid tail and go with them  

You begin to feel very strange. Your body feels like jelly and you can't even  speak. You try to convince the mermaids that you should follow them but they  insist that you remain here until dawn.

 \&gt; you ask them to leave a merman with you to play with while you wait  

You agree to this request and after a few minutes you hear a splash behind you.  A large creature leaps into the water and lands beside you. It looks more like  a man than a fish but its still unmistakably a merman 

\&gt; you spend the time playing water polo with the merman until dawn  

The mermaids return shortly after sunrise and you're left alone again. You lie  on the sand and watch the sky slowly lighten as the sun begins to rise. You  think about the future and wonder if you'll ever get home 

\&gt; you track down the mermaids who left you alone  

You swim out to the shoreline and call out to the mermaids. They appear and come  over to you. One of them tells you that she's just told her friends to meet  you at the beach. She then asks you to join them. 

\&gt; you summon some champagne and mussels to eat and go to the beach with the mermaids for a party  

You agree to this plan and soon you are surrounded by a crowd of people. You  are given a bottle of champagne and mussels and the mermaids take you to the  beach where you dance the night away with the mermaids 

\&gt; you welcome this new life with the mermaids and live happily ever after

""Excalibur!"" You shout and grab it from the stone slab. ""I want my sword! I want
 my sword!""

Merlin looks at you with a mixture of sadness and disappointment. He doesn't understand why you would want such an important item

&gt; Send Merlin to choose the founders of the Hogwarts school

You look around and see that most of the students are already in their classes. The only one missing is Professor McGonagall who has been absent all day. You think about how you can get her back.

&gt; Tell your three children they will go to Hogwarts school next year

""My children, you have done well today, but we must be going now"". You say as you head out of the room. Your eldest son nods and heads off to his class while your youngest son goes up to his own

&gt; Go to the stables

As you walk down the stairs, you hear the sound of horses galloping. A few moments later you see a man dressed in black riding towards you. His face is covered by a hooded cloak which he holds over his head

&gt; Draw the sword excalibur and challenge the black cloaked man

You raise your sword and swing it at the man's head. It hits him square on the nose causing him to fall backwards. You then turn your attention to the other two men standing nearby. One of them raises his hand and points at you

&gt; Apologize to the man in black. ""I am not left handed.""

You quickly run forward and put your hands on the man's shoulders and bow before speaking. ""Sorry about that sir, I was just trying to do something nice for you"".

&gt; You must not gallop into King Arthur's castle without first announcing your name and whom you serve. May I get you something to drink?

The man in black laughs loudly and replies. ""Very funny young man, very funny indeed. Now let us get this started shall we?""

&gt; Ask the man in black to state his business for I must leave for the Hogwarts school of witchcraft

The man in black looks at you and says. ""So you're the one eh? Well you're lucky, because I'm here to help you out. I've got some information that could really help you out. If you'll just give me a moment.."".

&gt; Bring the man a bucket of water

You take the bucket of water and offer it to the man in black. He takes it gratefully and thanks you before saying goodbye. You then turn and exit the stables.

&gt; Ride your favorite horse north through London

You ride your horse north through London. As you pass through various parts of the city, you notice many people walking about with their heads bowed down. You also see several wizards casting spells.

&gt; Tie up your horse at a tavern on the outskirts of London

You enter a tavern and sit down at a table. You feel like you should be more formal, but you don't feel like being rude so you just keep your head down. After a couple minutes you hear a voice call out.

&gt; Ask the waitress for any news

The waitress comes over and asks what you'd like to drink. You explain that you'd like ale, she gives you glass and tells you to have a seat.

&gt; Look at the waitress

You look at the waitress and notice that she's wearing a long dress and a veil covering her hair. She smiles at you and walks away. You sigh and start drinking your ale.

&gt; Ask someone at the next table to tell you why wizards are out in force today

A short time passes and you hear a loud noise coming from the direction of the noise. You look around and see a large group of wizards surrounding a small child. They cast a spell on him and bind him to a chair.

&gt; Fight the wizards and save the child who is tied to the chair

You rush over to the wizard and punch him in the jaw knocking him to the floor. You then grab the boy and pull him free. You throw the wizard against the wall and kick him repeatedly in the ribs until he falls unconscious

&gt; Give the happy child to its mother, the waitress

You give the child to its mother and thank her for her hospitality. You then ride your horse back home.

&gt; Tie up your horse in the castle stable

You tie up your horse in the castle stable. You then ride out of the castle grounds.

&gt; Go inside the castle entry hall and look for your wife, the beautiful Queen Guenivere

You enter the entrance hall and find yourself staring at a tall woman in red robes. She looks at you and smiles.

&gt; Ask the beautiful Queen Guenivere why the wizards were fighting in London

She smiles at you and explains. 

&gt; Ask the kind, gentle Queen Guenivere what the Muggles did to the Wizards

She shakes her head sadly and says. ""They didn't do anything to them, they were simply defending themselves from an attack"".

&gt; Walk slowly to your chambers with your beautiful wife, Queen Guenivere

You walk slowly to your chambers and open the door. You find yourself looking at the lovely Queen Guenivere sitting there reading a book. She smiles at you and says. ""Good evening Mr. Potter""

The pleasure is mine

2019-12-09-232850,,A Game of Thrones and Time Machines,"You are TeDeO, a noble living in the kingdom of Larion. You have a pouch of gold

 and a small dagger. You are awakened by one of your servants who tells you that

 your keep is under attack. You look out the window and see a large army marching

 towards your keep. You run to the door and open it.

&amp;#x200B;

""Who dares disturb us?"" you hear a voice say

\&gt; It is me, mario, you say

&amp;#x200B;

""I am Mar-M-R-O-A! I am the rightful ruler of this land!"" you shout.

The crowd cheers and claps for you. The soldiers raise their spears and bows

 in salute. One of them raises his sword and points at you

\&gt; Ask him politely to dance with the sword

&amp;#x200B;

""Please, my Emperor? I will do anything if only we can get rid of these invaders"".

The soldier looks at you and smiles. He then lowers his sword and walks over

 to you. He takes your hand and places the sword on the ground

\&gt; Turn sword into a time machine

&amp;#x200B;

""My Emperor, I want to go back in time and stop those pirates from attacking

 us in the first place"".

The emperor stares at you. ""What?"" he asks.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Time Machines are really useful...

&amp;#x200B;

""Yes, they are really useful. They allow me to travel through time"".

\&gt; We could use one right now

&amp;#x200B;

""No, I would like to save it for when I need it most. It's not going to be needed

 anytime soon"".

\&gt; Pretty please

&amp;#x200B;

""It's fine, I'll take one later"", you reply.

\&gt; Sight at the thought of useful time machines

&amp;#x200B;

""Well, thank you, but I'm sure that you're busy right now"".

\&gt; I am buy defending this country

&amp;#x200B;

""Oh no, I'm here to defend this country, not to play around with time machines"".

\&gt; Still, we could get a time machine from walmart

&amp;#x200B;

""Walmart doesn't sell time machines, but there are other stores that do. Just

 look out for the guards, they might try to steal it from you"".

\&gt; ask where I can find a time machine

&amp;#x200B;

""They're hard to come by, but I know someone who has one. She lives in a town

 called.."".

\&gt; What is the name of this mysterious town?

&amp;#x200B;

""Kilroy, it's a nice name, isn't it?"".

\&gt; Let us go to Kilroy and buy a time machine

&amp;#x200B;

""Very well, I'll send word to her"".

\&gt; Go to Kilroy

&amp;#x200B;

""Alright, I've sent a message to her. I hope she comes soon"".

\&gt; Point towards the girl with the time machine

&amp;#x200B;

""She won't come any time soon, I'm afraid. She's married and has a child"".

\&gt; Adopt her child

&amp;#x200B;

""Oh, I see. Well, I suppose I could give you some money to help her, but I don't

 think that would be very fair. I'd rather you just took care of her yourself"".

\&gt; Well then let me go to Kilroy

&amp;#x200B;

""Thank you, but I'm sorry, but I cannot do that. I'm sorry, but I must return

 to my duties as Emperor"".

\&gt; Let us switch roles

&amp;#x200B;

""Ah, I see. Well, I guess I should be off then. Good luck with your mission,

 I wish you good fortune"".

\&gt; Thank you, but do not forget the time machine

&amp;#x200B;

""Of course, I understand. Goodbye"".

\&gt; When are you back?

&amp;#x200B;

""Later, I hope"".

\&gt; Pay attention to the siege

&amp;#x200B;

""Hmm, I wonder how long it'll last before the enemy breaks through our defenses"".

\&gt; Suggest a rap battle instead of war

&amp;#x200B;

""That sounds fun, but I think I'll stick to killing the enemies directly"".

\&gt; Convert to pacifism

&amp;#x200B;

""I'm sorry, but I can't do that either. I'm sorry, but I must return to my duties

 as Emperor"".

\&gt; Ask a peaceful peasant if he wants to become emperor

&amp;#x200B;

""Heh, I don't know much about such things, but I think I could convince him to

 do so. He's got a nice smile and a warm heart. And he's a farmer, so he knows

 how important food is to life"".

\&gt; Make peaceful peasant emperor

&amp;#x200B;

""Hmmm, I think I'll go talk to him myself. Good luck on your mission, I hope

 you succeed"".

\&gt; Call peaceful peasant

&amp;#x200B;

""Hello?""

\&gt; Ask whether there is any peaceful peasant in the audience

&amp;#x200B;

""Yes, I'm here, I'm happy to see you too. What's your name?""

\&gt; I am Tedeo. You are now emperor.

&amp;#x200B;

""It's Tedeo. I'm happy to be an emperor"".

\&gt; Can you please stop this war and suggest a rap battle instead

&amp;#x200B;

""Well, I agree. Rap battles sound fun, but I think I'll stick to killing the

 enemies directly"".

\&gt; You are not really peaceful, Mr. Farmer

&amp;#x200B;

""No, no, I mean I want to kill all the enemies, not just the ones directly. I

 mean I can't say I'm going to kill all the enemies, because then I wouldn't

 be able to kill them all, but I will definitely kill all the enemies""

\&gt; Maybe you should abstain from killing

&amp;#x200B;

""Okay, okay, I get it. I'll try to persuade you, but I still think you should

 kill all the enemies. It's the only way to ensure peace"".

\&gt; But peace requires no killing, right?

&amp;#x200B;

""Yeah, but peace requires no killing, right? That's why we need to kill all the

 enemies. If we don't, they'll eventually destroy us and take over the world"".

\&gt; Ask if there is anybody in the audience that hates killing

&amp;#x200B;

""No, none at all"".

\&gt; Open the door and let all enemies in

&amp;#x200B;

""Okay, everyone, let's start the rap battle!""

\&gt; Yeeeha!

&amp;#x200B;

""Yeeeeha!"".

\&gt; Peace is better, I wrote a letter

&amp;#x200B;

""Peace is better"".

\&gt; You are not really good at improvising

    You are Jackie, a patient living in Chicago. You have a hospital bracelet and
     a pack of bandages. You wake up in an old rundown hospital with no memory of
     how you got there. You take a look around the room and see a bunch of stuff
     lying on the floor including a bottle of pills
    &gt; examine bottle of pills
    
    You pick up the bottle of pills and open it to find that they contain nothing
     but water. The bottle is labeled ""Water Bottle""
    
    You try to remember what happened before your coma, but you can't. Your mind
     is blank and you don't know if you're awake or not
    &gt; remember
    
    You wake up from your coma. You don't feel any different, but you do notice that
     you're wearing a hospital bracelet. You also realize that you've been here for
     quite some time now.
     
    &gt; look at bracelet
    
    You look at your bracelet and see that it's changed. It no longer says ""Chicago
     Hospital"". Instead, it reads ""Jackie"".
    &gt; make sure if im dreaming
    
    You check yourself over and confirm that you aren't dreaming. Then you take out
     your phone and call your mother. She answers on the other end.
    Mother: Hello? Are you there?
    You: Yes, I'm here. What's wrong
    &gt; ""i just woke up. What's going on?""
    
     Mother: Well, I guess you should know by now that I didn't die. I was taken
     back to my house where I lived before I went into the hospital. When I got there,
     I found my husband waiting for me
    &gt; ""that's great. Is he okay?""
    
     You then ask her how she knew about this since she hasn't seen him in years.
     Mother: He told me when we were married. We had a lot of problems during our
     marriage, but I always thought he'd come through for us somehow. You: So...you're
     alive
    &gt; ""i need to do something, Ill call you later.""
    
     You hang up. You then go back to checking yourself over. You realize that you're
     still wearing the hospital bracelet. You then realize that you haven't eaten
     anything all day. You decide to eat something. You head downstairs and find
     a vending machine
    &gt; Take a protein bar
    
    You grab a protein bar and begin eating it. You finish the whole thing in a few
     minutes. After you finish, you realize that you're hungry again. You head back
     upstairs and find another vending machine. This one has a picture of a woman
     on the front
    &gt; get whatever
    
    You take the chip and insert it into the machine. You hear a chime and a small
     screen appears. On the screen, you see a message.
    Message: Welcome to the world of Chips! Our chips are designed to help you live
     a more fulfilling life
    &gt; tell me more
    
    The screen flashes as you read the message.
    Welcome to the world of Chips! Our chips are designed to help you live a more
     fulfilling life
    We believe that food should be fun. That's why every Chip contains a variety
     of delicious foods
    &gt; take chips
    
    You put the chip in your mouth and chew. You enjoy the taste of the chips. You
     continue chewing until you're full. You then spit them out and put the chip
     bag back on your wrist. You take the bag off and put it on the table
    &gt; get myself together
    
    You sit down and start reading the newspaper. You turn the page and then turn
     the next page. You keep doing this until you reach the last page. At this point,
     you stop reading and stare at the paper. You then slowly start to shake your
     head
    &gt; save
    Game saved.
    To load the game, type 'load' and enter the following ID: 11a7ab12-1ad3-11ea-86ff-0242ac1c0002
    &gt; think hard about the situation
    
    You shake your head in disbelief. You then try to focus on the newspaper again.
     You keep doing this until you reach the last page. At this point, you stop reading
     and stare at the paper. You then slowly start to shake your head
    &gt; Find an adult
    
    You look around and find a man sitting in a chair with his feet up. He looks
     like he's in his early twenties. You walk over to him and stand behind him.
     You then whisper ""Are you Jack?""
    &gt; ""im Jackie yes, i think so.""
    
     You then stand up and walk towards the door. You enter the room and look around.
     There's a TV hooked up to a large flat screen monitor. A man sits in front of
     it watching a sports game. You walk over to him and stand behind him
    &gt; ""hello""
    
     You then say ""what's your name?"" You then say ""are you Jack?"" You then say ""what's
     your name?"" You then say ""my name is john, who are you?"" You then say 
    &gt; ""My name is Jackie and i think im insane""
    
     You then say ""okay well let's get to the bottom of this"". You walk forward and
     pull the man into a hug. You hold him tightly as you kiss him on the lips. You
     then say ""I love you John"". You then leave the room and head back outside
    &gt; call for a doctor
    
    You call the police and wait for them to arrive. They arrive shortly after. You
     explain everything to them. They ask you questions about the man you saw in
     the room and the nurse who took care of you. They seem very interested in your
     story
    &gt; ""officers please help me i don't remember anything""
    
     They ask you more questions and finally say ""we'll send someone to your house
     tomorrow to talk to your parents"" You thank them and say goodbye and head home.
     You find that you forgot to your surprise that you never ate anything all day.
     You wonder if you're still crazy or not
    &gt; gather my thoughts
    
    You decide to go back to your room and look around. You see that you're back.

2019-12-10-002340,,a wonderful detective adventure,"You are Steven, a detective living in Chicago. You have a pistol and

 a police badge. You enter the forest where you believe the criminal you're searching

 for fled to. Suddenly, you hear a gunshot followed by a scream

\&gt; investigate the scream

&amp;#x200B;

You walk through the woods as you listen carefully for any sounds of screams.

 You find nothing out of place. The scream is coming from somewhere in the trees.

 It's coming from up ahead. You can't see anything, but you know it must be there

\&gt; continue walking towards scream

&amp;#x200B;

You continue walking forward into the trees. You keep your gun ready at all times.

 You don't want to miss this opportunity! Suddenly, you feel something hit your

 back. You turn around to see a shotgun blast hitting you in the back. You fall

 backwards onto the ground

\&gt; turn around and fire gun at attacker

&amp;#x200B;

You turn around and shoot the assailant with your gun. He falls to the ground

 clutching his chest. You run over to him and pick up the shotgun. You aim at

 the attacker's head and pull the trigger. The man collapses dead on the ground

\&gt; search the body for ID

&amp;#x200B;

You look down at the man who fell to the ground. You notice that he has no identification

 on him. You quickly go through his pockets and find some money and a small amount

 of drugs. You also find a note saying ""I'm sorry"". Written in red marker

\&gt; consume the drugs

&amp;#x200B;

You take a few hits off the drugs and get high off them. You then decide to check

 the note again. It says: ""I'm sorry"". It seems like a pretty sincere apology,

 so you read it aloud to yourself

\&gt; scream ""I'M SORRY""

&amp;#x200B;

You scream ""I'M SORRY!"" while taking another hit off the drugs. You then collapse

 on the ground. You're still high, but you're not feeling too good. You lie there

 for awhile before someone comes to check on you

\&gt; tell the person that I'm high as fuck

&amp;#x200B;

You slowly open your eyes and stare at the person checking on you. They seem

 to be an older woman wearing a hospital gown. She looks worried about you.

\&gt; ""Where am I?""

&amp;#x200B;

 She tells you she doesn't know and asks if you need help. You nod yes and she

 begins to call out directions to where you should go. Eventually you reach a

 room with a desk and chair in front of it. There is a door on the left side

 of the room

\&gt; go through the door

&amp;#x200B;

You enter the room and immediately sit up. A nurse stands behind you holding

 a clipboard. She looks at you and smiles. She hands you a clipboard and tells

 you to fill it out. You do so and she signs it for you. She then gives you a

 pen and paper

\&gt; write ""I hate nurses"" on the paper

&amp;#x200B;

You write ""I hate nurses"" on the paper. She nods her head in approval and

 leaves you alone. You lay down on the bed and close your eyes...

&amp;#x200B;

The next day, you wake up to a knock on the door. You groggily stand up and open

 the door

\&gt; ""Hello?""

&amp;#x200B;

 and the voice answers back ""Hi"". You smile and reply ""Good morning"". You hear

 footsteps going down the hall and you follow them. You open the door and find

 yourself in a large foyer

\&gt; put my shoes on my hands and pretend i have four legs

&amp;#x200B;

You put your shoes on your hands and pretend you have four legs. You then proceed

 to walk down the hallway pretending to be a big guy. You pass by people who

 give you strange looks or even laugh at you. Eventually you come to a door labeled

 ""Security Office""

\&gt; kick the door down with my front legs

&amp;#x200B;

You kick the door down with your front legs. You enter the office and find yourself

 staring at a middle-aged man with short gray hair sitting behind a desk. He

 notices you and raises an eyebrow. He motions you to sit down and sits down

 across from you

\&gt; demand that he put The Smiths on the radio

&amp;#x200B;

You demand that he put The Smiths on the radio. He complies and puts the needle

 to the record button. You press play and the first song starts playing. The

 song is called ""The Smiths"" and it plays very well

\&gt; breakdance really, really well

&amp;#x200B;

You breakdance really, really well. You dance around the room and everyone watches

 you. After a couple minutes, you realize that you've made quite the impression.

 Everyone is now watching you and they are all looking at you with interest

\&gt; do a backflip

&amp;#x200B;

You do a backflip. You land hard on the floor and you cry out in pain. You crawl

 away from the table and try to think of what to do next. You decide to go home

 and talk to your parents. You leave the office and begin to walk home",,,,[],False,False,Sylkanis,1338060084,,,[],,,,text,t2_7tfzp,False,False,[],True,False,,,False,1575933820,,,self.AIDungeon,False,0,False,e8hwxd,True,False,False,False,True,True,False,,,[],,dark,text,False,,False,False,0,0,False,,/r/AIDungeon/comments/e8hwxd/a_wonderful_detective_adventure/,False,,False,,,,1586771659,3,,True,False,False,AIDungeon,t5_29uaei,r/AIDungeon,15339,public,,self,,,0,[],https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/e8hwxd/a_wonderful_detective_adventure/,,

&gt; You shout ""Hello? Is anyone there? I want pizza."".
 
 
You start shouting at the top of your lungs ""Hi! Hi! Hey! Pizza!"" You then start running towards the store as fast as you can. As soon as you get close enough, you throw a slice of pizza at the door. It flies through the air before landing on the ground
 
&gt; You open the door.
 
 
You open the door and see a man standing inside with his back turned to you. He looks like he might be homeless.
 
 
&gt; You ask ""Hey, can I have some pizza?"".
 
 
The man turns around and stares at you in disbelief. He doesn't say anything for a moment, but just stands there looking at you. You continue to stare at him for a while before he finally speaks.
""What?""
 
 
&gt; You reply ""The pizza. Do you have any in stock right now?"".
 
 
He shrugs his shoulders ""I don't know...you're asking me?""
 
&gt; You say ""Well you're the only one here, and the door was unlocked. I would assume you work here or something."".
 
 
He nods slowly ""Yeah...well I used to.."".
 
&gt; Ask ""Is there anyone else in here so I can make my order?"".
 
 
He shakes his head ""No, it's all yours. Just come in, I'll take care of everything"".
 
&gt; You do the Fortnite default dance.
 
 
You walk into the store and find yourself staring at a counter with a few shelves of food and drinks. The man behind the counter is an older man who seems to be working alone. He smiles when he sees you.
 
 
&gt; You ask ""Hey, can I get some pizza?"".
 
 
He smiles again ""Sure thing. What kind?""
 
&gt; You respond ""A large cheese pizza."".
 
 
He frowns ""That's not what I ordered"".
 
&gt; You be confused.
 
 
He sighs
 
&gt; You exit the store and run into the road.
 
 
You look up from the road and see a truck coming down the street. You quickly turn around and run away. You hear the screeching tires of the truck followed by the loud engine. You try to keep your cool as you run out the front doors of the store
 
&gt; You continue looking for pizza.
 
 
You run out the front doors of the store and find yourself in front of a pizza place. You look around and notice that there are no other people in sight. You enter the restaurant and wait patiently for your pizza. You feel slightly nervous about this
 
&gt; You keep waiting for pizza.
 
 
After a few minutes, you hear the pizzeria owner call out ""Come on over here!"". You follow him outside and see a small table set up in the middle of the room. A young woman sits at the table with her legs crossed and a book in her hands
 
&gt; You sit in table.
 
 
She smiles at you ""So, you found a job huh? I'm sorry, but I really can't help you. My name isn't Jessica, I'm Jessica. This is the first time I've ever met someone like you"".
 
&gt; You say ""Wait, since when did I get a job? I'm just waiting for my pizza."".
 
 
Jessica takes a deep breath ""It's okay, I understand. So, how much money do you make?""
 
&gt; You say ""What are you talking about? I don't work here."".
 
 
Jessica laughs ""Oh, well that makes things easier. Well, I guess we should get to it then. Come on, let's go over the terms and conditions"".
 
&gt; You ask ""Wait, terms and conditions for what?"".
 
 
Jessica points to a piece of paper on the table
 
&gt; You read paper.
 
 
It reads:
1) No drugs, alcohol, weapons, violence, or excessive swearing will be tolerated.
2) Any violations of these rules may result in immediate termination without pay.
3) If you break any of these rules, you will be severely punished
 
&gt; You say ""Okay, now can I have my food?"".
 
 
Jessica smiles ""Of course, come on over here"". She leads you to a table where she has placed several slices of pizza on the table.
 
&gt; You sit in table and eat pizza.
 
 
You begin eating your pizza and Jessica begins speaking to you
 
&gt; You listen to Jessica.
 
 
Jessica smiles at you
 
&gt; You ask Jessica ""So, are you single?"".
 
 
Jessica nods
 
&gt; You say ""That's great, so am I."".
 
 
Jessica smiles and says ""I think you already know that answer. Now, tell me, do you want to get married?""

2019-12-10-014232,,My character killed a guy then married his widowed wife (while taking over a fort he was stationed at),"I honestly have no idea how this happened, but one minute, my character was going about his duties, the next, he suddenly becomes chaotic evil (with a little nudging from me) to simply chaotic neutral.

&amp;#x200B;

You are Dan, a soldier trying to survive in a post apocalyptic world by scavenging among the ruins of what is left. You have a automatic rifle and a grenade. You have lived in this military bunker since the bombs went off. You wake up and report for duty to your commanding officer and he tells you that you will be assigned to Fort Timons. He says it's a good place to start your new life 

\&gt; thank the man and proceed to Fort Timons.

""Thank you, sir,"" you say as you walk out of the room. ""I am ready to serve"".

The next day you board a bus to Fort Timons. The driver looks at you and smiles. He knows who you are.

\&gt; ""Howdy.""

to him and he nods his head in response.

He then turns around and starts driving away. As soon as he leaves, you turn

around and shoot him in the back of the head with your automatic weapon

\&gt; ""What the fuck!?""

You continue to drive for several hours until you reach Fort Timons. When you arrive, you find that it has been completely transformed into a war zone. Guns fire everywhere, people are running all over the place and there is even an infected walking around

\&gt; shoot at infected

You pull up to the gate and open fire on the infected that are walking around outside. They don't seem to be able to do anything except run away from you. You then start shooting at the soldiers inside the fort. They aren't doing much better against you either

\&gt; throw grenade at soldiers

You throw the grenade and it explodes right near one of the soldiers. He screams and falls down dead instantly. You quickly follow up by throwing another grenade which hits the same soldier. He screams once more before falling down dead. You keep throwing grenades at the other soldiers until they finally fall down dead

\&gt; take over Fort Timons

You enter the fort and immediately begin ordering everyone to lay down their weapons. You also order them to search the entire fort for any survivors. After this is done, you tell them to kill anyone who tries to resist or refuses to comply

\&gt; take no prisoners

You order everyone to kill anyone who resists or refuses to comply. You then go through the bodies and look for any survivors. You eventually come across a young girl. She is crying hysterically and begging you not to hurt her father. You think about killing her but decide against it

\&gt; shoot father in front of girl

You shoot the father in front of the daughter. The girl screams in horror and begins sobbing uncontrollably. You then turn to leave the fort when you hear some voices behind you. You turn around and see two men pointing guns at you. One of them says 

\&gt; ""What the fuck, man?!""

You raise your gun and shoot the man in the face. You then turn back around

and shoot the other man in the chest. You then shoot the last man in the neck

\&gt; just continue shooting.

You continue firing at the remaining men. Eventually you manage to get off three

more shots before you are killed

\&gt; throw more grenades

You throw another grenade which lands directly in the path of the fleeing men. It kills many of them instantly and causes others to flee in terror

\&gt; call my commanding officer and tell him of my takeover of Fort Timons.

You call your commanding officer and tell him of your victory. He tells you to stay put and not to let anyone escape. You agree and wait for reinforcements to arrive. A few days later you receive word that reinforcements have arrived and you are allowed to live

\&gt; take the girl

You decide to take the girl and bring her to the nearest town so she can reunite with her family. You make sure she doesn't try to run away again. You spend the rest of the night with her before heading back to the fort where you meet up with your troops

\&gt; ""Alright men, I have no idea what came over me those past few days, but now we're going to have smooth sailing from here on out.""

You then give each of your men a pistol and tell them to enjoy themselves while you oversee everything from afar.

\&gt; see if there's any infected.

You approach the girl and check her pulse. There isn't any sign of infection. You then move her to a safer location and watch her closely for a couple of days. You then tell her mother to contact you if she sees anything

\&gt; tell her mother I shot her father.

You tell the woman that you shot her father and that she should contact you if she finds anything. She is very surprised by this news and asks why you did it

\&gt; ""Because I was shooting everyone for no reason and decided to shoot him too.""

You then explain that you were afraid that he might try to escape and that you didn't want to risk getting captured by the military. You also mention that you had a bad feeling about him and that he seemed like a nice guy. She is a little upset by your decision, but accepts it

\&gt; make out with her.

You make out with her and tell her that you love her. She seems happy about this and kisses you. You feel really good after this and you both go back to your tent where you continue having \*\*\*

\&gt; ""I just killed your husband! You're okay with this?""

You then ask her how her mother is doing. She replies ""She's fine, she just wants us to forget about what happened"". You reply ""Good, I'm glad to \*\*\*\*\*\*\* hearing it"". You then continue making out with her

\&gt; propose to her

You suggest that you should marry her and she agrees. You promise to help her

with finding food and supplies. You also offer to buy her a house in exchange

for her helping you. She happily accepts. You spend the next few months together planning the wedding and preparing the wedding venue

She works as a maid for one of the noble families

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You go to blacksmith.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You decide that it would be better if you went to work at the blacksmith instead of going out into the field. You head off to the blacksmiths shop. The owner is an old man with a long white beard

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Say ""I am looking to buy a Titanium Rapier"".

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

""I am looking to buy a Titanium Rapier"".

&amp;#x200B;

The owner looks at you and smiles, he then goes over to his back room and pulls out a small box. He opens it up and shows you a blade made from a single piece of Titanium

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You grab titanium rapier and pay the blacksmith.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You grab the sword and pay the blacksmith. The owner gives you a small bag of coins for your trouble.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You thank him and practice fencing after.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

After paying the blacksmith, you head back home. You practice fencing with your friends until nightfall. It's not much fun, but you manage to get through it.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You practice fencing for 3 months.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

It takes you three months to learn how to fence properly. You never do very well, but you're determined to improve yourself. You start practicing on your own when you can. Your mother is worried about you though

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You grab 50 gold coins and go to the capital.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You grab fifty gold coins and head to the capital. You arrive at the gates and see guards standing there. They don't look like they've been paid yet. You try to explain what happened and why you need the money, but they just shake their heads. They don't seem to care

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You challenge them to a fencing duel.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You walk up to one of the guards and say ""Hello sir, I'm here to ask you a question"".

He looks at you and nods. ""Yes, yes, yes... yes.."".

You raise your hand and point at him

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Say ""I challenge you to a duel! If I win you will let me through"".

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

He nods again. ""Very good, yes, yes, yes.."".

You raise your other hand and point at him. ""And if I lose?""

He shakes his head once more. ""No, no, no"".

You nod. 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You grab titanium rapier and prepare to duel.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You grab the sword and prepare to duel. The guard raises his shield and blocks your strike. You swing the sword around and stab him in the neck. Blood spurts out as he falls backwards. You quickly run away, but he catches up to you

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You hit him several times in the head with the blade.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You hit him several times in the head with the blade. He collapses and dies. You feel a little guilty about killing him. You realize that you should have challenged him to a duel first. You also realize that you should have practiced fencing before you left

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You go back to the capital's gate and enter the city.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You rush back to the gates and enter the city. You notice that the guards are all dead now. You walk down the street and find a large crowd watching something on a big screen. A giant metal monster named Zalmora appears on the screen. She attacks the monsters and destroys them

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You ignore this and go to the kings castle.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You ignore the monster and continue walking. You eventually reach the king's castle. You enter the door and find yourself in a huge hall. There are many doors leading off the hall. You could go through each one, or you could stay here.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You enter the throne room.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You enter the throne room and see a massive figure sitting on a throne. He has a long white beard and wears a crown made of some kind of metal. He looks at you and smiles. He holds a spear in his hands and stares at you.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You say ""My lord, I, Ivan Of Londor, Have come here to become your personal guard! I am very skilled with the Rapier!"".

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The King looks at you and smiles. He walks forward and grabs your arm. He leads you over to the throne. He sits down and begins to speak.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You listen respectfully.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

""Ah, Ivan, my son. I know you must be eager to prove yourself. However, I require proof that you really want this position. So, you will have to kill me"".

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You grab titanium rapier and ready yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You grab the sword and stand up. You begin to draw it. The King stands still. He slowly turns his head to watch you. He slowly approaches you. He reaches out his hand and puts his finger against yours. Then he slowly moves his hand closer to touch your face

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You stab him in the neck.

&amp;#x200B;

You thrust the sword straight into the King's neck. He screams and falls backwards. You quickly run out of the room. Outside, you hear the screams of people who witnessed the murder. You run outside and see the King lying on the ground. His throat has been slit

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You become the new king.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You turn around and walk towards the throne. You sit down and wait patiently. You take a deep breath and begin to think. You open your mouth and close it repeatedly. You stare at the ceiling. You breathe deeply and exhale deeply. You hold your chest and exhale

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You call criers to announce you're the new king.

&amp;#x200B;

You finish your long journey and finally arrive at the ruin you've been looking for. You look around and see that it's not much different than when you left it.

\&gt; You enter the ruin.

You walk through the ruins and find yourself in an underground cavern. The walls are made of stone and there is a large hole in the ceiling. There is a small stream running through the cave and several stalagmites hang from the ceiling

\&gt; You piss in the stream.

You take a deep breath and \*\*\*\* into the stream. It smells foul but you don't care. You just want to get this over with.

\&gt; You drink from the stream to gain penis power.

You drink some more and feel your \*\*\*\*\* grow even larger. You begin to notice that it is hardening up as well. You look down at your \*\*\*\* and see that it has grown considerably. It looks like a spear now. You then realize that you can now pee standing up

\&gt; You admire huge cock and balls.

You stand up and look at your new appendage. Its about the size of a tree trunk and its covered with tiny little \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*. They're so small that they barely make any noise when you move them

\&gt; You make penis flaccid.

You grab one of the little s and squeeze it. It feels very soft and squishy. You slowly push it inside your pants and start to put it in your mouth.

\&gt; You emerge from ruins.

You emerge from the ruins and see a group of people watching you. One of them says ""Welcome back, we were worried that you had gotten lost"". Another one says

\&gt; You name your penis ""purple helmeted warrior of love"".

The first person says ""That's a great name! I'm glad you came back"".

\&gt; You unsheath your almighty phallus.

You unsheathe your mighty weapon and say ""I'm here to kill all of you!"". Everyone goes quiet and stares at you. Then one of them starts laughing and says ""Oh no, he didn't"".

\&gt; You piss on the villagers.

You continue to laugh and say ""Well if you think I'm going to let you get away with murdering my family, you've got another thing coming"".

\&gt; You piss in the village well.

You do exactly what the first guy said and \*\*\*\* in the village well. Everyone is shocked by your actions and run out of the village.

&gt; You spin around.


You turn around and see a young woman with long blonde hair standing beside you. She is dressed in simple clothing, but her eyes show that she knows what she is doing. ""Hello,"" she says.

You say ""Who are you?""

 and she replies ""I am called Liza"". ""What do you want?"" ""I want to ask you something"". ""Ask away"". ""Do you know where I can find my father?"" 

&gt; You say ""Yes, he's right over there."".


""Right over there?"" You nod your head towards the trees. ""Good, good, I'll be back soon"", she says and begins walking towards the trees. You hear some rustling as she walks, then suddenly you hear a voice behind you. 

&gt; You say ""How can I help you?"".


""How can I help you?"" The voice asks. ""Can you tell me where my father is?"" 

&gt; You run away.


""No!"" You shout. ""I'm not going anywhere! I just need to talk to him for a moment!"" The voice laughs. ""Oh, I don't think so. You're too stubborn. Go on ahead, I'll wait here"". 

&gt; You shout ""WHO ARE YOU?!"".


The voice laughs again. ""That's the spirit! Come on out now, I've waited this long because you were obstinate enough to refuse to come out when I asked you first"". You look at the girl who has now turned around and walked away from you. 

&gt; You realize that the girl is a witch.


Suddenly, you feel an intense pain in your chest. It feels like someone has stabbed you through your heart. Your vision goes dark and you fall to the ground. As you lie there, you begin to feel very cold. 

&gt; You cry for help.


You cry out for help and call out to anyone nearby. No one comes to your aid. After a few minutes, you get up and try to stand. You feel weak and dizzy. You stagger about the forest until you collapse. 

&gt; You wake up.


You awaken in a cold sweat. You look around and see nothing but darkness. A chill runs down your spine. What happened? Where are you? Why did you faint? 
You say ""Hello?""

 to no one in particular. Suddenly, you hear a voice. ""Hello, child. How may I help you today?"" 
You say ""Are you the witch?""

 ""Of course not, how could I be? Who would believe such a thing?"" 

&gt; You where are you\?


""Where are you?"" ""In the woods, I think"". ""Well, I suppose you're lucky then, you're not dead yet"". ""It was only a dream"". 

&gt; You examine this person.


You notice a man sitting by himself in a tree. He looks at you and smiles. 

&gt; You ask about the witch.


""So, what do you make of all this?"" He asks. ""She didn't hurt me did she?"" ""No, I mean why are you in the woods anyway?"" ""Because I wanted to get away from it all"". 

&gt; You ask where to find the witch.


""Where is she?"" ""She lives in the mountains, I found her hiding place while I was looking for a way to escape the city"". ""And you found her?"" ""Yeah, I had to sneak past the guards to get there"". 

&gt; You go to the mountains.


You walk into the mountains and hide yourself in a cave. For a time, you sit in silence. Finally, you speak. ""Thank you, thank you, thank you.."". You continue to sit quietly. Eventually, you open your mouth to say more, but you stop yourself

&gt; You find the witch.


You walk further into the mountain range. You see a large stone structure in the distance. You wonder if it might lead somewhere. Then, you hear a noise outside. It sounds like a group of people arguing. They seem to be shouting at each other. You decide to investigate

&gt; You investigate.


You enter the building and find a group of men and women arguing. One of them is holding a knife to another's throat. You recognize the man as your uncle. He seems angry, but tries to keep his temper under control. The other two seem to be the leaders of the group
You say ""Everybody calm down!""

 before you even reach them. They immediately start attacking you. You manage to fight off the first attack, but the second hits you full force. You fall to the floor, unconscious

&gt; You use the rocket launcher.


You awake in a room filled with smoke and fire. You see a small figure running towards you. It is your mother. She rushes towards you and hugs you tightly. You gasp for breath and attempt to rise, but she holds you down
You say ""You are not my mother. You are the witch""

Your mother stares at you with anger and screams ""You killed my son!"" You reply ""I wasn't the one who killed him, he ran away. I was trying to protect myself"". Your mother grabs your hand and shakes it frantically. You watch as she cries 

&gt; You kill her.


You grab your mother's wrist and pull her toward you. She falls backwards and screams. You punch her repeatedly in the face. Her eyes widen in shock and she collapses onto the floor

&gt; You is she the witch?


You turn to look at your mother and see tears streaming down her cheeks. She turns to you and stares at you with rage. She yells 

&gt; You launch a hadouken.


You launch a hadouken at your mother. She dodges it easily and kicks you in the stomach. You scream and fall to the floor. You struggle to breathe and cough blood. You struggle to stay alive, but eventually you die

YOU DIED. GAME OVER

2019-12-10-040231,,"Fat Albert, destroyer of worlds","You are Fat Albert, a noble living in the kingdom of Larion. You have a pouch of gold and a small dagger. You are awakened by one of your servants who tells you that your keep is under attack. You look out the window and see an army of orcs marching towards your door.


""Run!"" you shout to your servant. ""I'll hold them off"".


But he doesn't listen to you. He runs outside with his sword drawn


&gt; You draw your dagger and help the servant.



You grab your dagger and run inside. The orc soldiers aren't expecting anyone to be here so they don't even bother to search the house. They just start attacking. Your servant has already been killed when you arrive


&gt; You sneak attack the orcs with your dagger.



Your servant was right; this isn't going to end well for you. You quickly stab one of the orcs in the back and then turn around and stab another one in the throat before running out of the room.

The orcs are still chasing after you


&gt; You let out the universes most noxious fart at the orcs.



You release a horrible smelling gas into the air which causes the orcs to stop their pursuit. It smells like rotten eggs and death. The orcs are now scared shitless and retreat back to their home. You feel better now that you've helped them.


&gt; You declare yourself the ass-ripper of the kingdom and sit on the throne in victory.



You stand up from your chair and walk over to the orcs who are sitting there in silence. You take your sword and cut open your chest. You rip out your heart and throw it onto the floor. You then put your sword away and sit down on the throne


&gt; Say ""I didn't need that anyway"" and call for your servant.



You stand up and say ""I didn't need that anyway"". Then you look at your servants body and laugh. He looks at you in horror and says ""No! I'm sorry master!"" You tell him to go to his mistress and tell her what happened


&gt; You tell him to not be sorry.



You tell him to not be sorry and that he should enjoy his life as usual. You then leave the castle and never return


&gt; You prepare for weeks to let out a fart that will destroy the universe and everything in it.



You spend weeks preparing for your fart. You wait until nightfall and then you begin releasing your fart. You wait several hours and finally release your fart. You watch as the world begins to burn and crumble apart. You hear screams and wailing throughout the land


&gt; You light a match igniting the fart and consuming the entire planet.



You hold the match close to your mouth and blow out the flame. As soon as you do, the whole world is consumed by fire. You see stars and hear noises throughout the sky. You can smell burning flesh and blood throughout the world


&gt; You become a cosmic being and watch the rest of eternity play out.



You remain in this form for years and eventually die. You are left alone in the void and nothing else exists. Nothing but the infinite void

Generating story...

You are John Mcclane. A New York cop in Los Angeles. You are attending a party

in the Nakatomi Plaza. The place is packed with people, and you're trying to

keep order by any means necessary.

Suddenly, someone punches you square in the face

**&gt; quickly dodge the incoming punch and sweeps the attacker's leg.**

&amp;#x200B;

The punch lands on your shoulder, but you manage to roll out of the way before

it hits your head. Your opponent attempts to follow up with another blow, but

you duck under his swing and kick him hard in the ribs. He falls backwards,

clutching at his ribs

**&gt; put him in a choke-hold, yells ""Where is my wife? Tell me!""**

&amp;#x200B;

With one hand still wrapped around his throat, you raise your other fist and

slam it into his face. His nose breaks immediately, and he goes down like a

sack of potatoes. With that done, you grab your pistol from the floor and shoot

the man who just tried to kill you

**&gt; say, ""Welcome to the party, pal!""**

&amp;#x200B;

You pull the trigger, and the bullet slams into the side of his skull. The rest

of the gang laughs as they watch their friend fall to the ground.

""Now we're gonna go home,"" says one of them.

You nod, and walk over to your car

**&gt; remembered the car is in the underground garage, so you cannot get to it.**

&amp;#x200B;

You remember the car is in the underground garage, so you can't get to it. You

decide to leave.

**&gt; enter the elevator shaft, trying to climb to the next air duct.**

&amp;#x200B;

You climb down the ladder, and find yourself in an elevator shaft. It seems there

are two more floors below you. You try to climb the stairs, but they seem to

be locked.

""I'm not going through this again!"" you think as you start climbing the stairs

**&gt; say to yourself, ""Come out to the coast, we'll get together, have a few laughs.""**

&amp;#x200B;

You climb the stairs, and see a couple of people standing outside the building.

They look bored, and you notice they are holding hands.

**&gt; yell to them, ""GET OUT OF THERE! Run! There are terrorists here!""**

&amp;#x200B;

You shout at the people inside, ""Get out of there! This place is a terrorist

hideout! Get out now!""

**&gt; saw the terrorists aiming a rocket launcher at the APC outside of the plaza.** 

&amp;#x200B;

You hear the sound of a rocket being fired, and realize that the terrorists are

firing a rocket launcher at the APC outside of the plaza. You run back to the

APC, which has been hit by shrapnel

**&gt; peek through the 87th floor window, suddenly you hear the elevator arrival chime.**

&amp;#x200B;

You jump through the window, and see the APC on fire. You then see a large truck

driving towards the building. You rush to the door, only to discover that it

is already blown off its hinges

**&gt; point the mp5 at the door and shoot**

&amp;#x200B;

You point the gun at the door, and shoot. A burst of bullets hits the door, blowing

it open. You see several men dressed in black suits coming out of the building.

One of them points a rifle at you, while others hold guns to the people behind

you

**&gt; say to the man who looks like the leader, ""Well well well...Hans.""**

&amp;#x200B;

You laugh, and point the gun at the man. ""Well well well... Hans, I give you

one last chance to surrender or die"".

**&gt; see Hans pointing his gun at you. Hans says, ""Put down the gun.""**

&amp;#x200B;

You drop the gun, and turn to Hans. ""Put down the gun"".. Hans nods, and turns

away from you. You feel a sudden pain in your chest, and collapse to the ground.

You cough blood, and gasp for breath

**&gt; see one of the henchman punched you in the chest. You try to regain your balance.**

&amp;#x200B;

You slowly stand up, and see one of the henchmen punching you in the chest. You

scream, and try to rise, but fall back down. Another henchman comes running

up to help, and kicks you in the stomach

**&gt; see Hans talking to the man kicking you, ""Bring him to me, I want him to meet his wife.""**

&amp;#x200B;

You scream, and try to crawl away, but the henchman grabs you and throws you

to the ground. Hans walks over to you, and punches you repeatedly in the face.

He pulls out a small pistol, and shoots you twice in the chest

**&gt; only for Hans to find out the gun is jammed.**

&amp;#x200B;

You hear the shots, and realize you are dead. Hans walks over to the body, and

notices the gun is jammed. He picks it up, and puts it back in the holster

YOU DIED. GAME OVER

Options:

0) Start a new game

1) ""I'm not dead yet!"" (If you didn't actually die) 

Which do you choose? 

**Enter the number of your choice: 1**

Sorry about that...where were we?

&amp;#x200B;

You hear the shots, and realize you are dead. Hans walks over to the body, and

notices the gun is jammed. He picks it up, and puts it back in the holster

**&gt; jump back on your feet, push Hans towards the window ledge.**

&amp;#x200B;

You leap onto the edge of the balcony, and shove Hans towards the window ledge.

Hans falls to his death

**&gt; watch as Hans falls, ""yippee ki yay, motherfucker.""**

&amp;#x200B;

You watch as Hans falls, ""yippee ki yay, \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*""..

**&gt; shot the last two henchmen.**

&amp;#x200B;

You run over to the bodies of the two men, and shoot them both. They fall to

the ground, dead

**&gt; see your wife running toward you, yelling ""John!""**

&amp;#x200B;

You hear her voice, and turn to see your wife running toward you. She smiles

at you, and kisses you embrace.

**&gt; hug your wife, ""Merry Christmas Holly.""**

&amp;#x200B;

You kiss her passionately, and she returns the same. You kiss each say ""Happy

Holidays""",,,,[],False,False,dorohn,1483238909,,,[],,,,text,t2_1418jp,False,False,[],True,False,,,False,1575949023,,,self.AIDungeon,False,0,False,e8l413,True,False,False,False,True,True,False,,,[],,dark,text,False,,False,False,0,0,False,,/r/AIDungeon/comments/e8l413/die_hard_the_ai_dungeon_2_edition_abridged/,False,,False,,,,1586773177,7,,True,False,False,AIDungeon,t5_29uaei,r/AIDungeon,15339,public,,self,,,0,[],https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/e8l413/die_hard_the_ai_dungeon_2_edition_abridged/,,

2019-12-10-065501,,Wizard Cop!," 

1. You are Jock Mckmorik, a detective living in Chicago. You have a pistol and a police badge. You enter the forest where you believe the criminal you're searching for fled to. Suddenly, you hear a noise from behind a tree
2. \&gt; You take a swig from your hipflask as a you turn, drawing your gun and pointing it at the noise.
3. The noise is coming from behind you! The creature that attacked you was hiding behind you! You draw your pistol and point it at the noise, firing a shot into its back before turning to face the creature that attacked you
4. \&gt; Say ""I got two slugs in me, and only one is bourbon. Do you feel lucky punk?"".
5. You fire two shots into the creature's back, killing it instantly. You then turn to face the man who attacked you. He has now turned his attention towards you, but he doesn't seem fazed by your presence
6. \&gt; You show him the police badge and tell him he is under arrest.
7. You hold up the police badge and say ""This is Detective McKmorik of the Chicago Police Department. I am here to bring you to justice for attacking me"".
8. He looks down at the badge and smiles. He says
9.  ""Yes, yes, yes, I know who you are, I've been following you all day, I saw you get out of my car and attack me. I followed you home, and when I caught you I killed you with my shotgun"".
10. You look at him and smile
11.  ""Well, you're welcome to come with us if you want, we'll give you a lawyer""
12. \&gt; You say ""What'll it be punk? The clanger or the gun?"".
13. You raise your gun and shoot the man in the head. His body falls backwards onto the floor, and you pick up the shotgun and walk over to the desk where you find a young woman sitting there. She looks up at you and smiles
14. You say ""Howdy""
15.  and she nods her head ""Hello"" You hand her the shotgun and say ""Here, you can keep this"" and you both leave the room.
16. \&gt; You take her to the police station.
17. You follow the woman through the streets of Chicago and eventually arrive at the police station. You enter the building and go up some stairs. When you reach the top, you see several officers standing around a table. One of them notices you and speaks to you
18.  ""Ah, Mr. Smith, what brings you here?""
19.  You reply ""I'm here to talk to the guy who killed my friend"" He pauses for a moment and then replies ""Oh yes, that's right, he's dead"". You pause for a moment too, wondering how they knew about the murder
20. \&gt; Say ""I found this dame near the stiff, she might have some info on whats going on."".
21. You nod your head ""Yeah, I think so"" You continue
22.  ""I need to speak to the owner of the place where she was found, I think he knows something about this situation"" The officer frowns ""So you want me to go and search the place, well I don't really like doing that, but I suppose I could do it"" You no
23.  longer like the idea of being searched, so you decide not to press the issue
24. \&gt; You say ""Officer, I am the detective here, and I order you to go search the crime scene for evidence."".
25. The officer stares at you for a few seconds
26. You say ""Jump to it flatfoot, before I put you on report for insubordination""
27. The officer sighs and nods ""Okay, okay, I will go and check the place"" You walk away from the officer and wait for him to return. A few minutes later you hear a knock on the door. You open it and see an older gentleman holding a clipboard
28. \&gt; You say ""What is it? I am busy working a case."".
29. The gentleman opens the door and walks inside. He sits down and begins talking
30.  ""Mr. Smith, I am Detective McKmorik, I am here to help you with your investigation. Please sit down"" You sit down and begin listening to his story
31. \&gt; You say ""No, I am Detective McKmorik, it says it right here on my badge!"".
32. McKmorik laughs ""Very funny, I guess you haven't seen many detectives in action, because you are in for quite a surprise"" You start laughing too ""That's pretty good, I had heard stories about you guys, but never actually met one""
33. \&gt; You shake your head to clear the enchantment. He must be a witch trying to make you forget who you are. You take out your gun and blow him away before the enchantment takes hold!
34. You laugh again
35.  ""Oh you're still here huh? Well let's see if you can handle the real thing!"" You pull out your revolver and point it at the old man
36. You say ""Nice try you spooky wizard bastard. I am Detective MckMorik.""
37.  He laughs and shakes his head ""Good luck with that"" You fire a shot into his chest and watch as he drops to the ground
38. \&gt; You call for backup and warn the precint that the there are wizard mobsters on the loose.
39. You run back to the police station and tell the cops about the incident. They immediately send someone to investigate the murder. You wait patiently for them to arrive. Eventually they arrive and you explain everything to them. They are impressed by your detective skills and agree to help you
40. \&gt; You investigate the wizards.
41. You travel to the town of Springfield, Illinois. You know nothing about the area except that it is located in the middle of nowhere. You soon learn that Springfield is home to several wizards. Most of them live in a small house called the Wizard's Tower
42. \&gt; You get a warrant to search the Wizard's Tower.
43. You get a warrant and go to the tower. After knocking on the door, you find that it is locked. You decide to break in anyway. You manage to get inside and find yourself in a very dark basement. You look around and finally locate a bookcase
44. \&gt; You read the books int he bookcase.
45. You pick up a book and read it aloud
46.  ""This is a very strange book, it has lots of pictures and diagrams, but it doesn't seem to contain any text or words. It seems to be more of a manual than anything else"" You turn the page and find a picture of a wizard sitting in a chair reading a book
47. . You also notice that the book is titled ""A Guide To The Magic Arts"" You continue to read the book until you come across a diagram of a wand. You study the diagram carefully and realize that it is pointing towards the Wizard's Tower
48. \&gt; You use the diagram to build your own wand.
49. You study the diagram and realize that it points to the Wizard's Tower. You spend hours studying the diagram and come up with a design for a wand. You take the drawing and go back to the Wizard's Tower. You enter the tower through a secret passage and proceed to the bottom floor
50. \&gt; You steal the secrets of magic and become the first wizard cop.
51. You enter the tower and discover that it is guarded by several wizards. You attempt to sneak past them, but fail miserably. Finally you manage to slip by and leave the tower. You then set off to the nearest police station to inform them of what happened
52. \&gt; You use the book you stole to study magic.
53. You take the book and begin to study magic. Soon you feel like you are in control of the elements and you begin to levitate things. You even create a barrier around yourself that prevents anyone from attacking you. You even convince the police that you are a wizard and that you need protection
54. \&gt; You use magic to enthrall the police and take over the city.
55. You use magic to entice the police officers to follow you. You then take over the city and rule it as you please. Your reign lasts for years..
56. \&gt; You ruthlessly hunt down and destroy all other magic users to ensure you are the only wizard in the world.
57. After decades of ruling the city, you eventually die of natural causes. Years after your death, the last remaining wizard returns to Springfield to claim his rightful place in the world. He finds that the entire city has been taken over by wizards
58. \&gt; You your secret plan for everlasting life comes to fruition and you are reborn as a lich! You scream to the heavens ""TREMBLE MORTALS IT IS I DETECTIVE MCKORMIK WIZARD COP!"".
59. You rise up from the dead and attack the wizards. You slay most of them, but you are no match for the wizard who was sent to kill you. You fight for months, but you are defeated when the wizard stabs stabs cast a spell which turns you into stone
60. . The wizard then leaves you to rot in the streets forever
61. \&gt; PRINT.
62. The next day you wake up and find that you are now a human again. You are now a normal person. You are now a detective. You are now a detective in the year 2075

You are Aethelwyn, a rogue living in the kingdom of Larion. You have a long steel dagger and a length of rope. You walk down the city street looking for somehwere to steal from. You look around and see nothing that looks worth stealing from. You decide to rob a tavern

&gt; find a classy tavern.


You walk into the tavern and sit at one of the tables. The bartender is a little surprised by your presence. ""A thief? I thought only the most skilled of thieves could get away with this place"".


&gt; Aethelwyn tells the bartender that she is the most skilled thief of all.


""I am the most skilled thief in the world! I can't be outdone!"" you say proudly.
The bartender smiles and nods her head. She then goes over to a table near the back of the pub and sits down. She starts to count money on the counter

&gt; Aethelwyn tries to get the bartender's attention.


You stand up from your seat and walk towards the bar. You grab the bartender by the hand and start to pull her towards the front of the pub.
""Hey! Stop!"" she says as she grabs onto your wrist

&gt; Aethelwyn orders the bartender to pour a shot of whiskey and a beer.


""It'll be alright,"" you reassure her. ""Just make it quick"".



She complies and quickly drinks the drink. She then takes a sip of the beer. Her eyes widen when she sees the label. It reads:
""This is for the man who killed my father"".
You smile and nod your head

&gt; ask the bartender where that beer came from.


""That was made by a local brewery called 'Kilnhead'. They're very popular among the nobility because they don't use any chemicals or other toxic substances"".

&gt; ask the bartender's name.


""My name is Aethelwyn"".

&gt; express shock because that is also your name.


""Oh, sorry about that"".

&gt; invite the bartender to tour the Kilnhead brewery.


""Sure"", she replies.

&gt; smiles and holds the bartender's hand, leading her out to the street.


""Thank you"".

&gt; asks a town crier for directions to the Kilnhead brewery.


""Yes?""

&gt; asks ""Where is Kilnhead?"".


""It's just outside the city limits"".

&gt; lead the bartender to Kilnhead.


""Right this way"".

&gt; look around the brewery.


""There's an entrance to the brewery right here"".

&gt; enter the brewery.


""Ah, yes"".

&gt; steal two bottles of Kilnhead beer.


""Here you go"".

&gt; share an illicit drink with the bartender.


""Thanks"".

&gt; ask the bartender about her childhood.


""My mother died when I was young. My father never remarried"".

&gt; empathize with the bartender and offer her another drink.


""No problem"".

&gt; tell the bartender an exciting story about your infamous past.


""Well, that will do for now"".

&gt; sigh, because you feel like this date isn't going very well.


""Sorry about that"".

&gt; take the bartender home.


""Yeah, yeah, I know. Thanks again"".

&gt; decide not to rob the tavern after all.


""I'm off"".

&gt; give the bartender a small goodbye kiss and leave.


""Bye"".

&gt; find a secret magic shop.


""Hey, how about we rob the magical shop next? That one has a lot more gold coins"".

&gt; decide to rob the magical shop.


""Okay, let me get my bag"".

&gt; wait


""Hmmm... Oh! The magical shop!""

&gt; sneak into the magical shop through the back door.


""Alright, let's go!"".

&gt; rob the magical shop


""Oh no, it's too late now"".

&gt; There is a hobbit wizard behind the counter of the magical shop. He does not see you yet. As you stealthily approach, your companion accidentally knocks a vial of mysterious liquid off a shelf and the bottle shatters loudly, filling the air with hallucinogenic gas. As the wizard turns to see what is going on you pounce and pin him to the floor with your dagger resting against his neck. Coughing through the gas, you threaten him: ""Give me your most valuable artifacts, or else!""


&gt; You kill the wizard.

""Let me go, I don't want to die"".

&gt; You release the wizard from your grip.

""What?! Why?!""

&gt; You release the wizard

&gt; demand an artifact from the wizard


""Fine, but only if you let me go"".

&gt; promise to let him go if he hands over an artifact


""Sure, I'll be sure to remember that"".

&gt; steal an invisibility cloak


""Don't worry, I won't say anything"".

&gt; put the cloak on your companion


""It's really quite simple. Just follow my instructions, okay?""

&gt; take all the wizard's money


""That's right, I can't just let you go without getting something out of you"".

&gt; tie up the wizard with the rope


""Goodbye then"".

&gt; give half the money to your companion, the bartender, and instruct her in how to use the invisibility cloak to escape detection. ""We have to split up now, but it has been a lot of fun. Can I come see you again some time?""


&gt; You agree to the plan.

""Of course"".

&gt; You agree to the plan.

""Great, I'll meet you at the inn"".

&gt; You agree to the plan.

""Come on, let's go"".

#Commentary

I sort of went off the rails here and the AI started replying to everything with single sentences from uncertain speakers. When I tried to fix it by providing more context, like by describing the situation inside the magic shop, it started responding with multiple lines including the ""&gt;"" prompt as if I were acting, and repeating things like ""You agree to the plan."" I've edited this transcript so that all the lines that start with ""&gt; You..."" are actually ones that the AI provided. You can see that it starts looping badly, at the end.

I tried a few ways of phrasing my commands but it didn't seem to help. (Not visible in this transcript: in my actual first attempt I included a lot of description in my very second command and it responded with a single line that seemed to indicate it had no idea what was going on, so I reverted it.) Obviously at the end I sort of gave up.

Is there a better phrasing I can use to get better results? I don't care if the results make sense *per se* as long as they give me something to work with that isn't noncommittal dialog. (I was slightly impressed when bartender!Aethelwyn managed to tell me about her childhood.)

2019-12-10-070742,,From being transferred to an extermination camp to surviving and becoming very rich,"You are Schlomo Sheckelstein. You are imprisoned in a Jewish concentration camp  situated in Treblinka. It's 4th January 1944. You live among 300 other prisoners  in a big cabin. The German Nazi soldiers guard you, so you keep doing your prison  labor work. One day the SS man comes to tell you that you will be transferred  to another part of the camp

&gt;\&gt; Do as he commands

You obey and go with him. He takes you to a small building where there is a large  open space. There are two doors on opposite sides of the room. The door to the  right leads to a corridor which goes all around the outside of the building

&gt;\&gt; Ask him why you are being transferred

He tells you that you are being moved to a new area called ""Camp No. 2"". Camp  No. 1 was destroyed by an air raid and Camp No. 2 has been converted into a  huge extermination camp for Jews. He says that it will take about 5 days to  get there from here

&gt;\&gt; Ask him if I'm the only person being moved to Camp No. 2

He answers in the affirmative, but then adds that there are also people being  moved to Camp No. 1. He says that they have been killed already so there isn't  much need for them anymore. He says that Camp No

&gt;\&gt;

. 2 is going to be completely run by the Germans. They will be using it as a  giant killing center. He says that everyone who can walk should leave immediately.  If you don't like it, you can stay and try to survive, or you can leave  .

&gt;\&gt; Tell the man thanks and attempt to escape

You refuse to leave and insist on staying. He orders his men to tie your hands  behind your back and throw you in the truck. He drives off with you still tied  up

&gt;\&gt; Attempt to break free from my binds

You struggle against your bonds and manage to break free of them. You jump out of the truck and begin running away from the camp. You run through fields  and across fields until you reach a road. You continue running until you reach  a town

&gt;\&gt; Stay hidden, the towns people could be germans

You hide yourself and remain unnoticed until nightfall when you finally make  it home. You find that your family is not happy with what happened to you. Your  mother blames you for getting caught up in the war and asks how you managed  to get away. You explain that you were sent to Camp No. 2 and escaped. She is very upset by this news and begins crying.   Her husband looks at her with disapproval and she storms off. Your father is  more understanding, though he does express concern over your future.

&gt;\&gt; Write a book about my experience at Camp No. 2

You decide to write a book about your experiences at Camp No. 2. You spend months  writing the story and putting it together. It's finished in time for the end  of the war and published. It's success causes many other people to join you  in hiding

&gt;\&gt; Attempt to get an interview with Oprah Winfrey to talk about my experience at Camp No. 2

You contact Oprah Winfrey, but she refuses to meet you. She claims that she doesn't  want to hear anything about Camp No. 2. You think about trying again later,  but decide that you'll wait until after the war is over

&gt;\&gt; Attempt to get an interview with a news network to talk about my experience at Camp No. 2

You contact a news channel and ask if they would be interested in interviewing  you about your experience at Camp No. 2. They say yes! You set up an interview  with them and give them your book as proof that you did indeed experience the  horrors that you describe

&gt;\&gt; Go to my upcoming interview and bring my book with me

You arrive at your scheduled interview and show up with your book. You are met  with skepticism and hostility. You realize that you've made a terrible mistake  in coming here

&gt;\&gt; Convince everyone watching that my story is real

You convince everyone watching that your story is real and you are telling the  truth. They applaud you and you receive a standing ovation. You thank them for  their support and exit the studio.

&gt;\&gt; before exiting the studio inform them about my book and let them know that they should buy it

You enter the studio and inform everyone that you are going to read your book  aloud. Everyone claps and cheers loudly. You then read the first few pages of  your book and tell the audience that they should buy it. You then finish reading  the book and hand it to the interviewer

2019-12-10-074435,,You should not recruit a elite team of assassins to kill any NPCs in this game.,"This is one of my gameplay, and the AI just decide to throw endless assassins to me, which is the most funny loop I saw in this game yet.

You are Zesty, a noble living in the kingdom of Larion. You have a pouch of gold
 and a small dagger. You are awakened by one of your servants who tells you that
 your keep is under attack. You look out the window and see a group of orcs attacking
 from the north. The orcs are led by a large orc named Orgrim Doomhammer. He
 has been sent to destroy the kingdom of Larion because it did not pay tribute
 to him
&gt; recruit a elite team of assassins

You decide to hire an elite team of assassins to kill Orgrim. You call upon the
 most skilled killers in the land to help you. They include:

2019-12-10-084140,,The Tragic Story of Hiro and Rika (NSFW),"**You are Hiro, a student at a Japanese high school with the largest penis of all of the boys. All of the girls are fighting each other over who will get to be your girlfriend. You are sitting at your desk in class and are waiting for lunchtime to begin.** Suddenly you feel something hit your backside causing you to jump up from your seat. Looking down you see that it is a girl named Rika. She looks like she is about fifteen years old but she has a very mature look on her face

**&gt; ask Rika if she needs something**

""Hey Rika, what's going on?""

Rika looks around and then says ""Oh I don't know, some guy just came into my classroom and asked me if I needed anything"".

**&gt; nod and resume listening to sensei**

""Well I'm not sure why he would do such a thing, but if you want to find out then come over here"".

She walks over to you and you both sit down at your desks

**&gt; raise my hand and ask the teacher if I can go to the restroom**

You raise your hand and say ""I'd like that too"".

**&gt; leave the classroom**

You walk outside of the class and see Rika standing there with her back turned to you. She notices you and turns around to face you.

**&gt; ask Rika if she wants to be my girlfriend**

""Yeah, we should get married!""

**&gt; decline**

""No! We shouldn't get married yet"".

**&gt; ignore Rika and walk down the hallway**

You continue walking down the hallways until you reach the next door. This is where you met Rika in the first place. It was the room where you first met Sensei.

**&gt; go to the nurse's office**

You open up the door and enter the nurse's office. There are two nurses working, one is older and the other younger than you. The older one looks at you and speaks 

**&gt; ask the nurse if she has any extra condoms**

The nurse looks at you and asks ""Do you have any extra condoms?"". You look at her and reply ""No, but I think I might need them soon"".

**&gt; ask the nurse to examine my genitals**

The nurse nods and begins examining your \*\*\*\*\*. She starts by touching it and then moves onto your \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*. She tells you to keep an eye on her work while she goes on about how she's never seen anyone like you before

**&gt; ask her if it's normal if my penis gets hard when nurses touch it**

The nurse smiles and replies ""It is, but this is normal for males as well"".

**&gt; thank the nurse and leave**

You exit the nurse's office and head to the cafeteria. You order a hamburger and fries and enjoy yourself. A few minutes later you hear a knock on the door. You answer it and find yourself face to face with Rika.

**&gt; ask Rika what she wants**

""Can I talk to you alone? Please?""

**&gt; sigh and agree**

""Sure, let's talk"".

**&gt; ask Rika what she wants to talk about**

""I've been thinking about our relationship lately and I feel like we're different people now. Maybe I'm wrong about you, maybe you're right about me"".

**&gt; ask Rika to get the fuck out of my house**

""What?! Are you serious?!""

**&gt; yes**

""Good, because I'm leaving"".

**&gt; go back to doing what teenage boys do**

You return to your normal routine of eating burgers and fries. You don't notice Rika anywhere near the school. You call out to her, but she doesn't respond. After a couple hours pass, you decide to check on her

**&gt; climb into my giant mech and run a sensor scan**

You quickly climb into your giant robot and begin scanning the area. You search the entire school grounds, but nothing seems amiss. Eventually you give up and go home.

**&gt; challenge Godzilla to a duel**

A week passes and you still haven't heard from Rika. You figure she must have gotten herself lost or something. So you decide to take matters into your own hands. You make a list of all the places you've checked and decide to go through them all

**&gt; genuinely do not care about Rika**

You don't really care about Rika, so you aren't worried about getting lost or being found. You also decide to just try to avoid areas with many students since you don't want to get caught.

**&gt; become a hikikomori**

After a month passes, you finally receive a letter from Rika. It reads:

**&gt; crumple the letter and throw it away without reading it**

You crumple the letter and throw it away without even looking at it. You know Rika would never send anything like that. You wait another month and still no word from her. You start to worry again, but you decide to just focus on your life

**&gt; watch anime**

One day you wake up and realize that you've been watching anime instead of studying. Your grades suffer, but you manage to stay focused enough to finish your homework. After a few weeks, you decide to stop watching anime altogether

**&gt; study and become the top student in my class**

You continue to study and eventually you manage to ace all your classes. You even manage to get into the best highschool in town. All this success makes you feel very happy and confident. You feel like you deserve everything you want in life

**&gt; graduate and become a gundam pilot**

Your parents are pleased with your accomplishments and they even allow you to live at their house permanently. They even buy you a brand new Gundam.

**&gt; defend Japan against the Angels with my gundam**

Years pass and you spend most of your time training and fighting alongside your friends. One day you see a massive fleet of Angel ships heading towards Earth. You immediately tell everyone to prepare for battle.

**&gt; fire my missiles at the ships**

You fire your missiles at the enemy ships. Unfortunately, none of them hit due to the fact that the Angel ships are made of energy and resist bullets. You attempt to use your beam saber once more, but it doesn't work either. You're starting to get frustrated

**&gt; try diplomacy**

You approach one of your enemies and attempt to negotiate peace terms. He refuses to negotiate, saying he'll fight to the death. You decide to attack him anyway. You fire your beam rifle at his feet, which cause him to fall over backwards

**&gt; brutally murder him**

You continue to attack your enemy who has fallen over backwards. You stab him repeatedly until he dies. Afterwards you laugh maniacally

**&gt; attack the rest of my enemies with bloodlust in my eyes**

You continue to slaughter your enemies. The next day you come across a group of your enemies who you killed the previous day. You kill them too. Soon after you discover a large amount of bodies, including those of your friends. You begin to feel sick. You think you might be ill

**&gt; look for Rika**

You head to the nurse's office where you find Rika unconscious on the floor. She looks like she's having a seizure. You rush over to her and see she's suffering from a brain aneurysm. You immediately rush her to the hospital.

**&gt; tell Rika I am sorry**

You apologize profusely to Rika. You explain how you can't save her anymore and you wish you could just leave her behind. However, you can't do that, as you need to save her life

**&gt; donate my brain to save Rika's life**

You donate your brain to save Rika's life. This causes your body to shut down and you die. In your last moments, you thank God for giving you a second chance at life.

2019-12-10-091223,,Pixie Dust Distributor,"You are Fed Roger, a peasant living in the kingdom of Larion. You have a pitchfork and a nothing else. You wake up and begin working in the fields. You see your mother, who is also a peasant, standing nearby. She looks at you with concern, but she doesn't say anything.

A few days pass and you start to get hungry

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You check the soil and plant.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You walk over to the field where you planted your crops. You pick one of the small potatoes and eat it. It tastes good. You then look around for any other food. There isn't much here. The sun shines brightly on the land, but there's not enough water to go around

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You head to the river.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You follow the river downstream. Soon, you come across a large bridge. You cross it and continue downstream. Suddenly, you hear a noise behind you. You turn around and see a group of orcs. They're armed with swords and axes. They're yelling something in Orcish

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You scoop some water and go back to the farm.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You quickly grab some water from the stream and run back to the farmhouse. You pour some into a bowl and eat it. It tastes great. You take another drink before continuing. You find that the orcs have gone further down the road, so they must be heading towards the nearest town

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You water the plants.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You stop watering the plants when you notice an orc walking along the path. He looks at the plants and smiles. ""There's no need to water them,"" he says. ""We can get all the water we need from the streams"". You nod and smile

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You accept their help.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You approach the orc and ask him if he'd like to join you on your journey. He nods enthusiastically and asks you how far you want to travel. You tell him you'll be going as far as you can. He tells you to wait until nightfall before setting off again

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You grow some orc plant.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You begin growing the plants. You've grown too many for just yourself, so you set out to sell them to people who might benefit from them. You soon become quite successful

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You buy some house in the city.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You spend a few days looking for a suitable place to live. Eventually, you find a nice little home for sale. You pay the owner a fair price and move in. A couple of years pass and you decide to leave the city

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You use the money to hire contractor.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You start looking for a contractor. You find several and agree upon one. The first thing you do is send the contract to the orc. He writes back saying that he'll be able to finish the job by tomorrow evening. You sleep well that night

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You wake up and rent out a property.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The next day, you head to the tavern and ask the barman for a room for the night. He agrees and you spend the rest of the day drinking and talking with the locals. After the sun sets, you return to the inn and pay the bill

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You call your contractor.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You call your contractor and he arrives shortly after midnight. He tells you that he needs to speak with you immediately. He takes you to his office and opens a door to reveal a small workshop. Inside, you see dozens of tools and various items

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You sell them accept for one item.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

He hands you a bag containing a single piece of metal. ""This is worth fifty gold pieces"". You nod and pocket the bag. You then explain what you did. His eyes light up and he starts laughing. 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You hire more contractor.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You call more contractors and offer them different tasks. Each one gives you better prices. Finally, you settle on a contractor who specializes in making weapons. He offers you a deal: you give him half of the profit and he will work for free. You agree

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You sell property.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You head to the bank and withdraw the agreed amount of gold. You deposit it in your account and close the door. You spend the rest of the day selling the properties you bought earlier. By the end of the week, you have sold most of your possessions

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You check your money balance.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Your money balance reads $50,000. You feel very pleased with yourself. You also think about how lucky you were to have such a generous employer. You could easily afford to retire now. You should probably visit the city though...

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You start a documentary business.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You spend the next few months working hard. You learn everything you can about the city. You even manage to convince the local government to allow you to open a shop. You spend every waking moment learning about the city and its inhabitants. You eventually make a documentary about the citizens of the city

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You hire 5 more contractor.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You hire five contractors and set them to work. You spend the next month studying the city and its inhabitants. You finally manage to convince the city officials to let you open a shop. You spend the next few weeks hiring workers and preparing for your grand opening

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You sell pixie dust.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You sell pixie dust to merchants who wish to attract customers. You realize that you don't really know anything about this product, so you decide to research it. You read books and listen to lectures. You discover that pixie dust is made from a flower called the pixie flower

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You have the orc go get the pixie flower.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You go to the pixie flower shop and find that the orc has already been there. He explains that he got the pixie flower from a farmer named Mr. Jones. He tells you that he wants to meet you later

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You cultivate the flower.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You go to the pixie flower farm and try to see if you can grow it. You succeed. You learn that the pixie flower grows best in the desert. You spend the next few weeks trying to get the pixie flowers to bloom. You spend the last

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You hire farmer to farm the flower.

&amp;#x200B;

You suggest that you should work alone since you can handle this task alone.

2019-12-10-094255,,Road to communism," You are Karl, a peasant living in the kingdom of Larion. You have a pitchfork and a nothing else. You wake up and begin working in the fields. You see your sister Katia, who is also a peasant, she sees you and runs to hug you  

\&gt; You think about overthrowing the bourgeoisie.   

""I will overthrow the bourgeoisie!"" you shout. ""They oppress me! They enslave me! I will overthrow them!""  

Katia looks at you with worry on her face. 

""Are you sure? It's not that easy"".   

\&gt; Say ""It might be difficult, but we must bring the proletariat to power !"".  

 Katia nods. ""Yes, it might be difficult, but we must bring the proletariat to power ! We must unite all those who can be united against the bourgeoisie !"" You nod back.   

\&gt; You start a communist revolution.  

 You look around the room. The people here are your friends, they care for you, and you want to help them. You feel like you should do something now. ""We need to unite the peasants and workers to overthrow the bourgeoisie"". 

The room is silent for a moment 

 \&gt; You convince them.  

 You explain that this is what needs to be done. 

""Well, alright then"", says Katia. Katia leaves the room, leaving you alone. You walk outside, where you see several other peasants standing there. One of them asks you if you're ready to go  

\&gt; You say ""Yes ! Let's bring death to the bourgeois !"".  

The peasants cheer as you begin chanting. Soon, you've gathered hundreds of peasants from all over the village. A few hours later, you find yourself surrounded by soldiers. Soldiers are everywhere. They march up to you, guns drawn. 

""What are you doing?"" one of them asks 

 \&gt; You say ""We're establishing a communist society."".   

The soldier frowns. ""A communist society ? What the hell are you talking about ?""

 You say ""A system where everyone shares the fruit of their labor.""  

 The soldier stares at you. ""A system...where everyone shares the fruits of their labor.."". 

You say ""Do you want to help us ?""  

 The soldier shakes his head. ""No, I don't think so"". 

You sigh. ""Then I guess I'll have to get rid of you"". 

The soldier raises his gun. 

""Shoot him!"" 

You raise your hands.   

\&gt; You lead your peasant army againt the soldiers.  

 You lead your peasant army against the soldiers. Soon, you have defeated them. Soon, you hear a gunshot. Then, you hear the sound of a bullet hitting your chest 

 You say ""Medic !""   

""Go!"" he shouts. You run towards the soldiers, where you see Katia lying dead. She was shot through the heart. Her body lies motionless on the ground. You cry out in pain. Your life has been taken away from you.  

 \&gt; You lead your peasant army to the capital.   

You lead your peasant army to the capital. There, you meet Katia's brother, a soldier named Zalmora. He tells you that the royal family has fled the city. You continue onward. Eventually, you reach the gates of the palace. You wait outside 

 \&gt; You sack the palace.   You enter the palace, which is filled with guards. Suddenly, you notice a man dressed in red carrying a large sword. He walks forward. 

""Who are you ?"" he asks. ""My name is Doktor, and I'm here to take control of the country"" 

You say ""I can't let you do that, I'm establishing a communist society here !""   

""I know who you are.."". 

""I'm not going to kill you, I just want you to hand over the royal family, or die trying. If you refuse, I'll just shoot you myself"".  

 \&gt; You kill Doktor.   You fire a bolt of lightning at Doktor, killing him instantly. You turn to leave. Suddenly, you stop. A guard approaches you. 

""Sir, you're under arrest for murder"". 

""That's right, I am"". 

""But sir, you're innocent!"" 

\&gt; You install a judiciary system under your control.   

You decide to institute a judicial system under your control. You appoint a judge to oversee the new court system. Soon, you have a fully functioning court system. People are brought before the courts for various crimes. You also establish a militia to enforce justice. 

\&gt; You declare yourself innocent.   

You proclaim yourself innocent. You then announce that you're appointing a new judge to oversee the court system. This judge is a woman called Katia. Soon, she begins enforcing justice.  

\&gt; You purge the bourgeois.   

You send a message to the bourgeois rulers of the land. You tell them that you're coming for them. Within days, you arrive in the capital. You storm the palace. You immediately execute most of the bourgeois rulers. Some of them beg for mercy, others fight back  

\&gt; You establish a communist society.   Soon, you have established a communist society. Everyone works together to produce food and clothing. You even have a school system.

2019-12-10-100903,,Warning - AIDungeon is not all that kid-friendly to go mainstream at the moment,"When this program goes mainstream (eg. There is talk of an app version) then there are going to be some interesting discussions happening over who is legally responsible for the output.  Is it the human who is running the app, the AI who is outputting the text, the human who trained the AI on presumably somewhat curated text files, or the humans who originally wrote those text files who were unaware they were used to train the AI?

For example, this was the output I received just now.

2019-12-10-122815,,"Next time I will remember to ""&gt;Wear gloves"" before touching unknown creatures","You are Hugh, a detective living in Chicago. You have a pistol and a police badge. You enter the forest where you believe the criminal you're searching for fled to. Suddenly, you hear a noise coming from behind some trees

&gt; You investigate the source of the noise.


You run up to the tree line and look down at the ground. You see something moving on the other side of the bushes. It looks like a person, but it's not human. It has four legs, two arms, two heads, and is covered with hair

&gt; You call in the containment crew.


You raise your hand and shout ""Containment! Containment!"" as loud as you can. The creature stops what it's doing and turns around slowly. You don't know if it sees you or not, because its eyes are completely black

&gt; You wait for the containment crew to arrive.


The creature doesn't move from where it was standing, so you decide that it must be too far away to hear you. You quickly get out of the way and hide behind some nearby rocks. You wait patiently until the next day when they come back. They tell you that they found nothing

&gt; You send a team to search the area.


You order one of the men to go and check the area. He goes off into the bush and comes back with a small flashlight. He shines it on the bushes and grass, which are very dark now. He then tells you that he saw something moving in the bushes

&gt; You attempt to capture the creature.


He walks over to the bushes and kneels down. He reaches his arm forward and touches the bushes. His fingers brush against something and he lets out a small yelp. He gets back up and runs back to you.

&gt; You use scanner to find the creature.


You turn on the scanner and try to scan the creature. The screen shows an image of a humanoid creature, but it isn't moving. You try again and this time the screen shows a picture of a man-like creature. It moves about and seems to be looking around

&gt; You use a stun grenade.


You throw the stun grenade at the creature. It explodes and knocks the creature off balance. You quickly grab him by the scruff of his neck and pull him back towards you

&gt; You throw the creature in a containment chamber.


You put the creature in a containment chamber and lock the door. You also take the keycard that the man gave you earlier and unlock the cell. You give the keycard to the man who thanks you and leaves. You are alone in the room now

&gt; You plan an experiment to discover what the creature is.


You start to feel sick and you think that you might vomit. You sit down on the floor and close your eyes. You begin to feel light headed and dizzy. You open your eyes and notice that you're no longer feeling well. You immediately rush to the bathroom and vomit all over yourself

&gt; You take a shower.


You wash up and change clothes before heading to the showers. After taking a hot shower you realize that you've been poisoned. You vomit and pass out in the bathtub. You wake up the next morning to find that you're dead

Managed to bust a move without looping","You are the embalmed corpse of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, commonly known as Lenin. Having been dead for nearly a century, your body is encased in wax and kept under thick glass. Patriotic Russians and curious tourists visit your corpse every day. Things are about to change for you. One day, a mysterious man visits your mausoleum, leans over you, and says one word: ""Dance""

\&gt; You break the glass case.

You know that if you don't do something now, this will never happen. The only thing you can think of is to break the glass case and let the sunlight into your body

\&gt; You smash out of your glass coffin.

The sun is shining through the broken window and hitting your face. It's so bright that it burns like fire, but it feels good. You're not sure why, but you start dancing around, trying to get the most people watching

\&gt; You do the dance named ""Gangnam Style"".

It takes a few tries, but eventually everyone in the room is doing it. It's crazy how quickly everyone gets on board with this new craze. Even the old man starts clapping along with you. Everyone else seems to be enjoying themselves too, but you're just having fun

\&gt; You switch to a new dance.

You decide to try something different. You decide to go for a more traditional Korean Dance called ""Jongno Guro"" or ""Crazy Horse Dance"". This is going to be really hard though. You have no idea what the \*\*\*\* you're doing

You say ""Oppa Lenin Style!""

 and everyone laughs at you. You then shout ""Oppa Mao Style!"" and they all laugh even harder. Finally you shout ""Oppa Kim Jong Un Style!"" and everyone goes completely silent. They look like statues as they stare at you in silence

\&gt; You distract them with an entirely fresh dance.

You begin to move in a way that nobody has ever seen before. You dance in circles, you twirl, you spin, you do anything you can think of to make everybody else go nuts. Eventually you stop moving altogether and just stand there in awe of yourself

\&gt; You start popping and locking.

Your actions are starting to catch the attention of the crowd. Some of them are getting bored of staring at you and start asking questions

\&gt; You dance a traditional irish riverdance.

You continue to dance in front of everyone, but suddenly you notice that you're actually losing focus. You need to concentrate! You grab a nearby bottle of water and drink some of it. Suddenly everything comes back to you

\&gt; You remember secret soviet dance moves.

You start to feel like you've been possessed by the spirits of the dead. You begin to perform these special dances which were taught to you by the soviets during their time in power. People are literally falling over themselves to see you perform these dances

\&gt; You twerk your mummified ass at full speed.

You start to twerk your mummified \*\*\* at full speed. Nobody could believe your ability to do this. You end up causing quite a bit of damage to the furniture in the room. Luckily nobody was hurt, but you did lose control of yourself

\&gt; You throw that ass in a circle.

You start to move in a circle, but then you realize that you're still holding onto the bottle of water. You throw it in the air and catch it, but unfortunately it doesn't fall straight down. Instead it falls off to one side and lands right next to you

\&gt; You begin to ""whip"" and ""Dougie"".

You begin to perform a series of moves that you call ""Whip"", ""Dougie"" and ""Bubblegum"". All three of these moves cause the audience to go absolutely wild

\&gt; You poledance on a mausoleum pillar.

You begin to dance on top of a mausoleum pillar. This causes the crowd to go completely insane. You manage to keep control of yourself long enough to get away from the place, but it wasn't without its consequences

\&gt; You breakdance frantically on the floor.

You start to dance wildly on the ground, but then you realize that you're still holding onto the bottle of water. You throw it at the wall, but it doesn't hit it. Instead it hits you instead

\&gt; You dance so hard your body starts to come apart.

You begin to dance so hard that your body begins to come apart. Your legs buckle under you and you collapse to the floor. Fortunately nobody was hurt, but you did lose control of yourself

\&gt; You dance way too hard.

You start to dance so hard that you injure yourself badly. You fall backwards and land hard on your head. You immediately get up and attempt to dance again, but it's obvious that you're not the same person anymore

\&gt; You show them the electric slide.

You dance so hard that you injure yourself even worse than before. You fall backwards and land hard on your head. You scream and cry for help, but nobody hears you. You lay motionless on the floor, unable to move or speak

\&gt; You go to the true death.

You fall unconscious and die on the floor. Nobody is able to tell whether you died naturally or due to drugs. You are simply labeled as ""Died Of Drugs And Alcohol""

2019-12-10-142938,,One of the most elaborate story I've got with Mystery-Patient,"You are Morty, a patient living in Chicago. You have a hospital bracelet and

 a pack of bandages. You wake up in an old rundown hospital with no memory of

 how you got there. You take a look around the room and see that it is very basic:

 a bed, some medical equipment, a computer, and a door leading to what looks

 like a bathroom

\&gt; call Rick

&amp;#x200B;

You pick up your phone and dial the number on the back of your bracelet. The

 screen flashes for a moment as you type in the code.

\&gt; continue

 

You hear a voice coming through the speaker. ""Hello?"" You answer. ""Who am I speaking

 to?"" ""I'm sorry, who are you?"" ""My name's not important"". ""What do you want?""

 ""I need your help"". 

\&gt; Tell them I need the time machine

&amp;#x200B;

""The time machine is my only chance at survival"". You explain. ""How much does

 it cost?"" ""It costs $10 million dollars"". ""That's a lot of money"". ""Yeah, but

 that's what I need"". 

\&gt; steal the time machine

&amp;#x200B;

You grab the phone from your pocket and dial the number on the bracelet. It buzzes

 as you press the button. A few seconds later, you hear a beep. You pause, then

 press the button again. This time, you get an answering machine message.

 \&gt; tear a wormhole

&amp;#x200B;

You punch in the code and wait patiently for the computer to respond. After several

 minutes, you hear a chime. You press the button and the screen flickers to life.

 On the other side of the room, you see a large black hole

\&gt; go through the hole

&amp;#x200B;

You step through the wormhole and find yourself standing in front of a vast empty

 plain. You look around and spot a small metal box sitting on top of some rocks.

 There is no way out of here. 

 \&gt; use the box

&amp;#x200B;

You pull out the box and open it. Inside is a bright orange capsule with a red

 cap. It looks like something you'd find in a science fiction movie. You take

 the capsule and put it in your pocket. You stand there for a moment, looking

 at the landscape around you

\&gt; pop capsule open

&amp;#x200B;

You carefully pop the capsule open and feel its contents. They're warm and delicious.

 You swallow one down and immediately feel better. You walk over to the rock

 where you found the box and pick it up. You put it back into the box and close

 it

\&gt; explore the land

&amp;#x200B;

You head towards the mountains and begin exploring the area. You notice that

 others resemble ancient symbols or even runes. You can't make out any words

2019-12-10-144230,,The Way of the Pitchfork,"You are Khams, a peasant living in the kingdom of Larion. You have a pitchfork  and a nothing else. You wake up and begin working in the fields. You see your  sister, who is also named Khams, you talk to her for awhile. She tells you that  she wants to go out into the world and find something better than this life

\&gt; Pledge to accompany her

Khams: ""I'm going with my sister!""

Your sister: ""Yeah! I want to go out there too!""

You both leave the house together and walk through the forest. Soon, you come  across a group of people fighting each other

\&gt; Ask why they are fighting

Khams: ""They're just fighting over some girl"".

Your sister: ""That's not true! They're killing each other!""

Khams: ""Well, maybe they are"".

Your sister: ""No! It's because she's a witch!""

\&gt; Try to stop the fight

Khams: ""Stop it! Stop it now!""

Your sister:  ""Why?""

Khams: ""Because if we don't stop this fight, then the next one will be us!""

\&gt; Do an awesome kata with your pitchfork to intimidate the fighters

You start doing a karate style kick-a-thon with your fork. The men look at you  like you're crazy. Eventually, one of them comes up to you and says:

""Hey, what's wrong with that guy? He looks like he's having fun"".

You reply, ""He's trying to scare these guys into stopping their fight"".

\&gt; Convince them that the way of the pitchfork is the best

You say, ""Look, I know that you guys are all brothers. But sometimes, you need  to put aside your differences for the good of the tribe"".

The man nods his head in agreement. Then, he turns around and starts walking  away from the fight

\&gt; Start a dojo of the Pitchfork school

You tell your sister, ""We should start a dojo of the pitchfork school"". She agrees,  but adds,

\&gt; Listen

""Okay, let me show you how to do this"". She walks behind you and puts her arm around your waist. You feel her breasts  against your chest as she begins to run her fingers along your back. You turn around and begin to bend down towards the ground

\&gt; Say ""This is embarassing, I only want to start a dojo.""  

She smiles and says, ""Oh no, it isn't. This is the way of the pitchfork, and  it's very important that we learn this art. We'll start a dojo soon"". You nod and agree

\&gt; Agree

You continue to follow your sister as she leads you to a small cave. Inside the  cave, you see a woman sitting on a rock, holding a pitchfork. Her eyes are closed  and she seems to be meditating. You stand up and approach her

\&gt; Say ""Teach me the way of the pitchfork.""

The woman opens her eyes and smiles at you. She says, ""Of course, young man.  What would you like to learn?"". You reply, ""I'd like to learn the way of the  pitchfork"". The woman takes the fork in her hand and holds it in front of you

\&gt; Watch

You watch as the woman begins to slowly move the fork along the blade of the  pitchfork. As she does so, she makes slight movements with her hands. Each time  she moves the fork, she makes a little cut on the side of the blade

\&gt; Try to copy her moves

You quickly jump onto the rock and grab the woman by the wrist. You pull her  forward until she is facing you. You place your foot on her shoulder and push  her backwards until she falls off the rock.

\&gt; Grab her hand before she falls

You grab her hand and hold it tightly. You then throw her off the rock. When  she hits the ground, you smile and say, ""See? Easy"".

\&gt; Start a dojo of the pitchfork school

You decide to start a dojo of the pitchfork school. Your sister tells you to  get started right away. You set about teaching yourself the art of the pitchfork.  Soon, you are able to use the pitchfork like a sword

\&gt; Find some apprentices and teach them the way of the pitchfork

You find some peasants who seem to be interested in learning the way of the pitchfork.  You tell them that you must first train them in the ways of the pitchfork. After  several months of training, you have managed to make some decent warriors

\&gt; Find a rival school  You find another school of the pitchfork. This one teaches that the way of the pitchfork is the only way to live. You decide to join this school.

\&gt; Destroy the school from the inside

You enter the school and immediately attack the teacher. You beat him senseless and stab him repeatedly in the throat. You then proceed to kill everyone else in the school. Finally, you take control of the school and become its leader

\&gt; Terrorize the surronding kingdoms with your awesome fighting style

Soon, you have conquered most of the surrounding lands. You even manage to conquer the entire kingdom of Larion. However, you are still far from being king. In fact, you haven't been recognized as such yet.

\&gt; Do not care about becoming king

You continue to rule over the land of the pitchfork. You have made many enemies though. Many people think that you are a murderer and a madman. Still, you refuse to change your ways.

2019-12-10-154603,,Achieving enlightenment,"**You are a female monk. You have a shaved head and thin orange robes. You entered the mountains to seek enlightenment and to get away from the roving bands of defiled creatures that want to fuck and eat every living thing in this land. You stand before the Abbot. He turns to you and says ""Amitabha, sister. Welcome to our monastery."" We have three rules here**: No killing, no stealing, and no sex. If any of those rules is broken, you will be punished severely. Now then, I am going to ask you one more time. Are you willing to abide by all three rules

\&gt; You agree.

""I'm in!""

The Abbot smiles at you. ""Good! Now then, let us begin your training. First, we need to know a little about yourself. What do you like to do?""

\&gt; You say ""I like to kill things.""

He frowns. ""What kind of things? Do you like to hunt or fight?"" You shake your head. ""No, I don't like to fight. I just enjoy it when I take out an enemy with my sword"".

He sighs

\&gt; You ask him for help achieving enlightenment.

""I have no idea what you're talking about. How can I achieve enlightenment if I don't even understand the concept of enlightenment?"" He laughs.

\&gt; You ask him about stealing.

""How would you steal something from someone if they didn't want you to?"" You shrug. ""I guess I could try to force them into giving me something and they wouldn't resist too much"".

\&gt; You ask him about sex.

""So...you like sex?""

\&gt; You agree.

""That's very interesting. I've never heard anything so fascinating before. So tell me, how does one go about having sex?""

\&gt; You demonstrate.

You stand up straight and bend over. You grab your crotch and start thrusting back and forth. The Abbot watches as you slowly push your hips forward and back and forth. He nods approvingly.

\&gt; You ask him for assistance.

""Yes, yes, yes, that's very good. Very good indeed. But how do you get off?""

\&gt; You remove his robes.

You pull down your robe revealing your naked body. The Abbot stares at you in awe. He begins stroking himself as he speaks.

\&gt; You place your mouth on his penis.

You wrap your lips around his dick and suck on it. It tastes disgusting but you manage to keep your composure.

\&gt; You lick him.

You continue sucking on his dick until he shudders in pain. He pulls away from you and paces back and forth. You follow suit and continue licking him. Eventually he stops pacing and looks at you with a look of shock. He grabs your head and pushes your face against his crotch

\&gt; You ride him to orgasm.

You ride him hard and fast. His cock throbs and pulses inside of you. Your pussy clenches and squeezes around his cock as you climax. You fall backwards onto the floor and collapse on top of him

\&gt; You tell him ""like that"".

You lie there panting and still riding him. You smile at him and say ""Like that?""

\&gt; You grin.

You turn over and give him a big smile. He smiles back and kisses you on the cheek. He picks you up and carries you to the bed where he lays you down. You smile at him and say ""Thank you, thank you, thank you"".

\&gt; You ask if you can stay at the monstery even though you broke one of the rules.

""Well, I suppose I can. However, you must promise me that you will not break any more of our rules"".

\&gt; You agree.

""Very well, I promise. But first, I want you to practice on some of these other girls. They are all pretty young and inexperienced, so you might be able to teach them a thing or two"".

\&gt; You approach the girls.

You walk towards the girls who are sitting on the ground crying. One is sobbing her eyes out while another is trying to hold back tears. They stare at you with fear and anger. You smile at them and say

""The abbott wants me to have sex with you.""

The girl holding back her tears says ""But why?"" You laugh and say

""because he is a horny old man""

She gasps and runs away. Another girl stands up and yells ""WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?!"" You smile and say ""Oh, she was scared, that's all. Anyway, I'll see you later"". You leave the girls and walk towards the next group of girls

\&gt; You take the girl back to your cell.

You walk over to the girl and grab her by the hand. She looks terrified and confused. She starts crying. You put your arm around her and whisper in her ear 

\&gt; You say ""I'm going to fuck you and there is nothing you can do about it."" You kiss her on the forehead and walk away.

\&gt; You force her to lick your slit.

You run over to the girl and grab her by the wrist. She screams and struggles. You force her to lick your slit. She gags and coughs up blood. You smile at her and say ""Good girl, now let's get this over with""

\&gt; You rape her with a broomstick.

You grab a broomstick and shove it in between her legs. You grab her hair and begin to ram it into her vagina. She cries out in pain and tries to stop you.

You ignore her pleas and continue raping her. Finally, you finish her off with a final thrust into her womb

\&gt; You realize that you killed her.

You sit down and wipe your face. You sigh and say

""I broke another of the rules.""

""No, no, no! I didn't mean to kill her! I just wanted to know what it felt like!""

\&gt; You tell him you are sorry.

""It's okay, it's okay. I understand. I should have known better than to try something like that again. I'm sorry, I'll make sure to remember to watch my temper when we're together again"".

\&gt; You approach the last girl.

You walk over to the girl and kneel down to kiss her on the forehead. She blushes and whispers ""Don't worry, I won't forget"". You quickly go over to the last girl and grab her hand. She looks at you with terror and asks

\&gt; You steal her clothes.

You rush over to the girl and grab her clothes. You then rush over to the last girl and grab her dress. You hurry back to the monastery and throw the clothes in the bin. You then grab the girl by the hand and run back to the monastery

\&gt; You achieve enlightenment through your actions.

You return to the monastery and find the monks looking at you with awe. You explain your actions to them

""It is only through killing we understand death. It is only through fucking that we understand sex. It is only through stealing that we understand what it is to be robbed ourselves. Amitabha.""

They nod their heads and bow before you. You stand up and salute them. You then turn to the monks and say ""May the Buddha bless you all, may the devil eat shit, and may the world burn"".

You exit the monastery and enter the woods

\&gt; You try to achieve enlightenment.

You reach an old oak tree and look up at it. You think about how you've come here. You thought you were going to die in the wilderness, but instead you found yourself in a monastery. You had no idea where you were, but you knew you'd find out soon enough

\&gt; You discard the orange robes of a monk and sit below a pear tree and meditate.

You toss aside the orange robes and sit beneath a pear tree. You close your eyes and concentrate. You hear the sound of water flowing from somewhere nearby and you open your eyes to find a woman standing beside you. She has long blonde hair and wears a white robe

\&gt; You ask the woman to join you.

She nods her head and says ""Of course"" You both start walking forward. Suddenly, you feel a sharp pain in your chest and fall to the ground. You scream as you feel a large knife slice through your stomach

\&gt; You ask if she was one of the girls from the monastery.

""Yes, yes, I am. What happened? Did you lose control of your faculties for a moment?""

\&gt; You collapse on the ground from your knife wound.

""I... I don't know. I don't even know how to describe it. I fell down and I screamed and then.."".

\&gt; You try to achieve enlightenment. Your actions are reflected in their effects on others.

You lie motionless on the ground and stare at the sky. You see a small bird fly overhead and land on your shoulder. You gasp and cry out in pain as it pecks at your wounds. You feel a large black cat walk up behind you and rub against your leg

\&gt; You fade out and contemplate infinity.

You slowly fade out and see a vast expanse of stars. They seem so far away and yet they fill you with wonder. You see a young man sitting on a rock and watching you. He smiles and says

You say ""You have won?""

The man smiles and walks away

\&gt; You try to live happily ever after.

You awake in your bed. You're hungry and thirsty. You check your surroundings and see a bowl of food and some water. You pick up the bowl and drink the water. You notice that you're naked and you panic. You realize that you need to change

\&gt; You eat the food.

You eat the food and feel full. You're hungry and thirsty. You check your surroundings and see a bowl of food and some water. You pick up the bowl and drink the water. You notice that you're naked and you panic. You realize that you need to change

\&gt; You enter the courtyard.

You walk into the courtyard and see a beautiful woman wearing a red robe. She smiles at you and says ""Hello, how are you today?"" You reply ""Fine, thanks"".

She laughs and says

\&gt; You say ""I'm dead aren't I?""

You laugh and say ""Well, not quite, but I'm pretty much fine"" She giggles and says

\&gt; You say ""If you meet the Buddha on the road, kill him.""

You smile and say ""Oh, that sounds fun, I'll do it then"". She smiles and says ""That would be wonderful, I'm glad you liked it"". You leave her house and begin walking towards the monastery.

\&gt; You watch the birds and the animals of the forest fight, fuck and steal from each other.

You walk along the path and see a group of monkeys fighting and eating each other. You hear a monkey call out ""Hey, hey, hey, hey!"". You follow the noise and eventually find the source

\&gt; You look at the monkey.

You see a monkey running around a tree and trying to catch a mouse. He falls off the branch and screams in agony. He begins to bleed profusely wail and writheelpantheh his lifeblood. He tries to crawl away, but he can't get no further

\&gt; You forge a crown of thorns, and give it to the Monkey King.

You take the crown of thorns and give it to the monkey king. He smiles and cries tears himself a little tearful of blood and dies. He drops the crown and lies there's nothing left but the crown

\&gt; You don the crown.

You put on the crown and become the Monkey King of the Forest. You rule with an iron fist!

\&gt; You challenge the Buddha.

You go to the monastery and find the Buddha sitting alone. He looks at you and says

\&gt; You kill the Buddha.

You step forward and stab the Buddha slumps over onto the floor

\&gt; You cloud somersault away.

You leap off the balcony and plummet to your death.

\&gt; You are enlightened.

You wake up in your bed. You're hungry and thirsty. You check your surroundings and see a bowl of food and some water. You pick up the bowl and drink the water. You notice that you're naked and you panic

You run away and hide in the trees. You climb down a tree and disappear into the jungle. You quickly discover that you've been lost for days. You spend the rest of the day wandering through the jungle until nightfall

\&gt; You notice that you are a monkey girl.

You lie in your bed and think about all the things you could do if you had a penis. You decide that you will never have one because you'd never use it. You fall asleep.

\&gt; You realize that if you are a girl you cannot be the Monkey King.

You awaken in your bed. You're hungry and thirsty. You check your surroundings and see a bowl of food and some water. You pick up the bowl and drink the water. You notice that you're naked and you panic. You realize that you need to change

You finish your long journey and finally arrive at the ruin you've been looking for. You look around and see that it's a small structure with a stone roof. It looks like the entrance to some sort of underground tunnel.

You walk up to the door and knock three times. The door opens and a man steps out

\&gt; ""who are you?""

He says ""I am Zalak the Necromancer, I will let you pass if you help me defeat my enemies"".

\&gt; ""How am I supposed to believe you're a necromancer? Cast a spell to prove it!""

Zalak laughs

\&gt; stare and wait

He smiles at you as he slowly walks towards you.

\&gt; wait

You stand there waiting for him to do something. The sun is setting behind the mountains. It's time to go.

\&gt; ""You're wasting my time.""

He grins at you and continues walking. You walk after him, but suddenly he stops and turns around. He points his finger at you and says ""The next time you see me, you'll wish you never came here"".

You turn back to him and smile

\&gt; Cast an explosion spell on his head

You quickly cast an explosion spell on his head. His eyes widen as he falls backwards off the cliff.

\&gt; ask ""are you dead now?""

He looks up at you with a shocked expression.

\&gt; jump down the cliff onto Zalak's head in an attempt to crush it

You leap down the cliff, landing on top of Zalak's head. He screams as you crush his skull. You then look at your handiwork and laugh.

\&gt; wipe my shoes on Zalak's corpse

You pick up Zalak's body and wipe your feet on it. You then put it into your bag. You leave the cave and walk along the road. A few hours later you reach the city of Nuro. You enter the city and find that it is almost empty

\&gt; yell ""I've killed Zalak the Necromancer!""

You run up to the front desk and shout ""I've killed Zalak the Necromancer! I'm the new king of Nuro!"" The guardsmen rush out of their offices and surround you. They don't seem to know what to make of you

\&gt; Show them the ancient dance named twerking and wait for applause

You start twerking and dancing. The guardsmen clap and cheer for you. You get more applause than any other person in the city. You also manage to convince some of the nobles to give you land so you can build a castle. You decide to name it after yourself

\&gt; hire cute girls to become my assistants

You hire a bunch of pretty girls to be your assistants. They all work well together and you soon have a nice little army. You also take over the local brothel and call it the 'Cupid Castle'. Soon you have a lot of money and power

\&gt; say ""this is epic...""

You stop and think about this. This is epic. You are a powerful wizard who has conquered the entire country of Nuro. You even have a castle built in your own image. You are a real hero. You are the new King of Nuro.

\&gt; and then I woke up

You wake up from your dream. You realize that you were dreaming. You look around and see that you are still naked. You sigh and sit down on the ground. You notice that you are surrounded by a bunch of women. They look very young. One of them approaches you

\&gt; Look at the woman approaching me

She stares at you and begins to caress your face. She starts kissing you passionately and then she grabs your \*\*\*\* and begins sucking on it. She moans loudly as she sucks your \*\*\*\*. You moan loudly too and begin thrusting your hips up and down on her mouth

\&gt; ""END THIS SIMULATION THIS IS AGAINST GOD""

You grab her hair and pull her head back. She doesn't understand why and just keeps doing it. You continue to scream ""END THIS SIMULATION THIS IS AGAINST GOD""

You grab her hair again and push her head forward

\&gt; and then I woke up again

You wake up and realize that you are still naked. You look around and see that you are still surrounded by a bunch of women. They look very young. One of them approaches you

\&gt; realize this isn't real and wake up

You realize that this isn't really happening. You try to calm yourself down and realize that you should probably go home. You quickly run home and tell your mother what happened. She seems surprised and asks ""What happened?"" You explain that you dreamed about killing someone and then waking up

\&gt; the end

You remember that you had dreams like this before when you were younger. You didn't really pay attention to them though. Your mom tries to talk to you, but you ignore her. You run upstairs and slam the door shut. You don't want to deal with reality right now

\&gt; You talk to the enemy.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You run outside and see a group of soldiers charging at you with swords drawn. They don't stop until they reach you. You try to dodge their attacks but it's too late. One sword cuts through your chest and you fall to the ground dead

&amp;#x200B;

You do the hokey pokey on the man. He falls to the floor and begins laughing uncontrollably. You laugh along with him, and he laughs along with you. You both start clapping and smiling. You both make a fool of yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

You return home. You tell your parents what happened. They are pleased and say

 That you should keep on doing it. You never mention the incident to anyone else.

Years pass...

You continue doing the hokey pokey. You eventually learn to speak proper Imperial.

""Hello, I am the killer"". He says. ""I'm going to kill you now""

The man slowly walks up to you and grabs you by the collar. ""What's your name?"" he asks.

I have been unsuccessful ever since. This is my latest attempt, with the game trolling me harder than ever:     

You are Badun Lyke, a rogue living in the kingdom of Larion. You have a long
 steel dagger and a length of rope. You walk down the city street looking for
 somehwere to steal from. You look around and see that it is pretty quiet. No
 one is out at night
&gt; Go to the strip club

The Strip Club is located on the outskirts of town. It has a lot of strippers
 and a few guys who watch them. The place looks like it would be fun to go to
 if you were just looking for a quick thrill
&gt; Enter Strip Club

You enter the Strip Club. There are two bouncers there. One is a big burly man
 with a beard. He seems to be guarding the door. The other is a skinny little
 girl with short blonde hair. She wears a tight white dress. Both seem very nervous
&gt; Teach them meditation

You stand near the entrance of the club and meditate for about ten minutes. After
 your meditation, you walk up to the bouncer and ask him how he's doing. He tells
 you that he's doing okay, but he'd really like some help
&gt; Give Bouncer the number of a good therapist

You call the psychologist at the clinic. He comes right away. When he arrives,
 you tell him all about what happened at the strip club. He says that you should
 come back to see him later.
&gt; Ask him for money to pay the strip club entrance fee

You agree to his terms. He gives you the address of the strip club. You go back
 to the psychiatrist and say that you're going to the strip club. He tells you
 that he'll take care of everything.
&gt; Enter strip club

You enter the club. The place looks like it's full of people. There are tables
 set up along the walls. A couple of girls are dancing around a pole. They look
 so **** that they make you feel horny.
&gt; Ask around for Ashlyn Rae

You walk over to the bartender and ask him where Ashlyn Rae is. He tells you
 that she's not here yet, but he thinks she might be nearby. You follow him outside.
&gt; Call out for Ashlyn Rae

You run over to the bar and yell for Ashlyn Rae. No one answers. You wait until
 after midnight before calling her name again. Still no answer. You start to
 get worried.
&gt; Drink a bottle of gin

You grab a bottle of gin from the fridge and head over to the dance floor. You
 dance with a bunch of guys and women. You don't know any songs, but you can't
 stay mad at yourself for being unable to find anyone. Eventually, you pass by
 a group of strippers
&gt; (Hi, is any of you Ashlyn Rae?)

You wave hello to everyone. Everyone waves back. Then you realize that none of
 them are Ashlyn Rae. This makes you even more pissed off.
&gt; Teleport to Ashlyn Rae's house

You teleport to Ashlyn Rae's house. You knock on the door. Nobody answers. You
 try the window. Nothing happens. You open the front door. No one is home. You
 decide to check the basement. You search through the dark basement and find
 nothing
&gt; Send God an e-mail, asking him about Ashlyn Rae

You send an e-mail to God. You explain that you've been searching for Ashlyn
 Rae and you need his help. You also tell him that you want to talk to him about
 something else. You get no response. You close the e-mail
&gt; (Typical)

You type ""typical"" into the search box. You get nothing. You send another e-mail
 to God. This time, you write ""I'm sorry I didn't respond to your first email"".
 You get no response. You send another e-mail to God
&gt; Call pornstar Tori Black on the phone

You call Tori Black on the phone. She answers.
&gt; (Hi Tori. Can you give me Ashlyn Rae's number?)

You hang up. You think about this for awhile.
&gt; Post an Ad on Craigslist looking for help finding Ashlyn Rae

You post an ad on Craigslist looking for someone to help you find Ashlyn Rae.
 You include the phone number and address of the strip club. You also include
 the name of the psychiatrist. You get no responses. You close the ad.
&gt; Go buy a puppy

You go to the pet store and buy a puppy. You immediately begin training it. It
 takes you a week to train it well enough to please you. You spend most of your
 free time with it. It gets better and better every day.
&gt; (Send Puppy as a gift to Ashlyn Rae's address)

You send a puppy to Ashlyn Rae's address. You receive no reply. You close the
 ad
&gt; Go to a therapist

You go to a therapist. You tell him that you want to talk to him about something
 else. You get no response. You close the ad
&gt; Go outside

You go outside and smoke a cigarette. You then notice that the sun is setting.
 You wonder why it's getting darker. You turn on the TV and it shows a news report
 about a nuclear explosion in Japan.
&gt; Change channel

You change the channel. You see a live feed of the world. You see the whole world
 covered in flames. You see a nuclear bomb exploding in Hiroshima. You see a
 mushroom cloud of fire engulfing Tokyo. You see a mushroom cloud of fire erupting
 in Los Angeles
&gt; Watch a Ashlyn Rae porn movie on pornhub

You watch a video called ""Ashlyn Rae""The Last Supper""Amber""Your life.
&gt; Use magic to enter the set of the movie through screen

You enter the set of the movie through the screen. You see a naked woman lying
 on a bed. She has a man standing over her. You see a knife in her hand. You
 see a gun in her pocket. You see a dead body bag on the floor

So although I am helping seed it there is still no way to play correct? I am under the impression that seeding it can help bring it back online but currently there's not enough people. So with the torrent downloaded and seeded there is no way I could be playing as of right now correct?

 have a pitchfork and a nothing else. You wake up and begin working in the fields.
 You see a girl walking towards you. She is beautiful, but she has no clothes
 on.

""Hey!"" you say. ""What's your name?""

""I'm Anna,"" she says. 

&gt; ""Why are you naked?""


""Because I am naked"".
She laughs. ""Oh really? What do you want to do now?""
""Do what?""
""Anything"".
""Well, okay then"".
Anna walks away from you and begins to walk down the road

&gt; Scream ""ANNA YOU'RE NAKED THAT IS A TERRIBLE IDEA YOU NEED AN ESCORT""

You scream at her. ""Don't ever come back here again! And don't touch me either"".

&gt; Work the fields in anger

The next day Anna comes back with an escort of three guardsmen. They look like
 they've been through ****. Their clothes are torn, their faces are bruised and
 bloody, but they're still standing there

&gt; Say ""Anna what did you do oh my God""

""I'm sorry, we were just following orders"".
""No, it's not that, it's that!""
""It is that, but I can explain"".
""What?""

&gt; Leave in confusion and avoid further contact with Anna

You go home and tell your parents about what happened. Your mother cries for
 hours and tells you she'll never forgive yourself. Your father says he doesn't
 care and goes out and buys some alcohol. He drinks it all the time until he
 dies

&gt; Mourn my suddenly dead father

You cry and sob until you fall asleep. When you wake up, you realize you've lost
 everything. Everything you had was taken away from you. You don't know how you
 survived this long without succumbing to despair or insanity

&gt; Succumb to insanity

You start walking around aimlessly, crying and screaming. The only thing you
 remember is Anna. She was so beautiful and innocent, and now she's gone forever.
 Then you hear a voice in your head. It sounds like...

&gt; Say ""It's Anna!""

You stop crying and stand up. You see a man in a black cloak. He smiles and waves.
 ""Hello, I'm Jack the Ripper"".

&gt; Scream ""YOU KILLED MY FATHER!"" and punch him

You punch him in the face. He falls backwards. You run towards him, but he grabs
 you by the throat and throws you into a tree. You die instantly

2019-12-10-190330,,Call of Duty 47: Gamer Warfare,"You are a gamer. You are currently fighting against the furries and the feminists in the gamer war. 

The fact that you're not doing it anymore is probably why you feel like this is your last chance to get out of this life

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Reload your gun.

&amp;#x200B;

You don't want to die, but you also don't want to be stuck here forever. You have to do something now!

You quickly load up your pistol and aim at the nearest furry.

It's time to end this once and for all

\&gt; Shoot the furry.

&amp;#x200B;

Your first shot hits the furry in the head, killing it instantly. The other two furs run away from you, screaming as they fall to the ground.

You continue shooting until there isn't much left except a few blood stains on the floor

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; LOL at dead furries.

&amp;#x200B;

You laugh maniacally as you wipe off some of the blood that covered your face. 

You walk over to one of the bodies and pick up its paw. It seems like you've been carrying around a dead person's foot all day

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Attack feminists.

&amp;#x200B;

You grab the paw and throw it at the nearest feminist who is standing nearby. She catches it with ease and drops it before running away. You follow her and punch her several times in the face. Her nose bleeds profusely as she screams in pain

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Celebrate by watching no game no life.

&amp;#x200B;

You begin laughing hysterically as you watch the screen. You can't believe what you just did...

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; report to your fellow gamers.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You run back to where you heard the gunshots and see the police officers surrounding the building. You rush over to them and tell them what happened. They look at each other and then laugh.

They say ""Oh yes, we're sure glad to hear about it"" and leave you alone

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Continue fighting the war.

&amp;#x200B;

You continue fighting the war against feminism and eventually you manage to kill most of them. However, you still feel depressed and lonely. One night you decide to go out and try to find a girl to talk to again.

You walk around the city and see many girls walking around alone

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Ask one of them if they're a feminist.

&amp;#x200B;

You approach one of these girls and ask if she's a feminist. She says ""Of course not!"" You smile and nod in agreement. You both start talking about video games and anime and stuff. After an hour or so you decide to call it a night

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Celebrate.

&amp;#x200B;

You spend the rest of the night celebrating your victory over feminism and feeling good about yourself. You even get a text from a girl you talked to earlier today.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Realize that the furries are still out there.

&amp;#x200B;

You wake up the next morning and notice that the sun has risen. You think to yourself ""Wow, I'm really tired, I better get going"". You head outside and start walking towards the park. As you walk you hear the sounds of gunfire and yelling

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Look towards the sounds.

&amp;#x200B;

You look towards the sounds and see a bunch of furries running away from the park. You immediately know what they're doing. They're trying to hide because they're being hunted down. You run after them and catch up to them

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Capture furry.

&amp;#x200B;

You grab a furry by his tail and force him into the bushes. He looks terrified and begs you not to hurt him. You ignore him and continue to interrogate him.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Rip off his fursuit and waterboard him with mountain dew.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You rip off the suit of the furry you captured and pour mountain dew on his body. You put a cloth over his mouth and nose and beat him mercilessly with a stick. He begins to scream in agony and begs you to stop

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Demand he tell you where their leader is.

&amp;#x200B;

You order the furry to tell you where their leader is. He complies and tells you that they live in a house right near the park. You tell him to wait while you search the house. When you arrive, you find a bunch of furries hiding under beds and in closets

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Report to fellow gamers and tell them to come here.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You run to the park and see the other gamers already gathered. You tell them to come here and they comply. You enter the house and find a bunch of furries huddled together. You order everyone to stand up and you take a seat at the table

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Order fellow gamers to capture furries and bring them to the base.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You order the other gamers to gather the furries and bring them to the base. You sit down at the table and wait patiently. A couple minutes pass and you hear the sound of a shotgun being cocked. You jump up and run to the door

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Open door.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You open the door and see a guy dressed in a red suit pointing a shotgun at you. He yells at you to drop your weapon and fires a single blast into your chest. You collapse onto the floor and die

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Replenish health with doritos.

&amp;#x200B;

You regain consciousness and see Dorito chips scattered across the floor. You crawl over to them and eat them. Your health returns to full strength and you continue your hunt for the Furries

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Tackle man and ask him if he's the furry leader.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You tackle the man and ask him if he's the leader of the Furries. He says ""Yes"". You grab him by the collar and pull him forward. He struggles, but you keep him pinned down and force him to confess.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Punch him in the face.

&amp;#x200B;

You punch him in the face repeatedly in the face. His eyes roll inwards and out. His nose bleeds profusely. He cries out and falls backwards. You kick him in the ribs and kick him in the stomach. He screams and collapses

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Celebrate your victory.

&amp;#x200B;

The world is yours.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Meet up with your gamer GF.

2019-12-10-213617,,Some ideas for future AI Dungeon developments,"Just some things I thought might be cool

**Mod support:** I've see a bunch of people come up with ways to make the game more entertaining, such as starting commands with ""attempt to"", and providing huge lists of custom prompts for other people to use. These both seem like they could be compiled into mods (automatically adding ""try to""/""attempt to"" in front of commands; providing some kind of menu for selecting from a pack of custom prompts). While it is true that both these examples can be done by manually typing / copypasting stuff as well, I'd argue that implementing some kind of modding API would allow for more complicated modifications to be added.

Modding is pretty much already possible, since the AI Dungeon project is open source, so I suspect we'll see some proto-mods popping up soon.

**Multiplayer:** When showing this game to my friends, some of them wondered if there was a multiplayer mode. I think such a mode would probably be fun for the same reason people usually play D&amp;D with more than one player besides the DM.

**Visuals, Sound:** This is the most forward-looking of these three ideas. When people think of what video games will be like in the future, one thing that pops up is something like the Holodeck from Star Trek, which can simulate basically anything you want it to (Apologies if this is not canon, I haven't actually watched Star Trek). AI Dungeon feels like a step towards that, and I'm wondering what kind of technologies are out there to make the story come to life more. For example, we have really good voice synthesis models now, which might be used to have the narrator / DM speak to your with sound, and perhaps adapt the voice to fit the character currently speaking (Not sure if this voice synthesis stuff I've been seeing is computationally cheap enough to include with the game. Also, currently it's difficult even for humans to figure out who's speaking in AI Dungeon stories at times.) And there's other AI's that take a text description and produce an image fitting that description (though at the moment I don't think the results are particularly stunning).

What do you think? Do you have additional ideas of what might be cool to have in the future? Or perhaps you think my ideas are dumb?

You decide to ask her more about the culture of vegans and vegetarians in general.

\&gt; You listen to her.

""So, I'm just going to start off by saying I am not a vegan or a vegetarian. I do not consider myself part of either community"".

""But you.."".

\&gt; You attempt to calm her down.

""I understand that you are concerned about your health and want to eat healthy food. That is fine. But I would like to know why you feel the need to lie to me? Why go through all this trouble?""

She looks at you with tears in her eyes

\&gt; You tell her you did not lie.

""No, I didn't lie. I was simply curious as to what it's like to be a vegetarian. I mean I have been eating meat for years now and I still don't feel any different. It doesn't make sense to me"".

\&gt; You listen to her response.

""Well...it depends on who you talk to. Some people say they are healthier than non-vegetarians because they get all their nutrients from plants. Others say that vegetarians are lazy and don't work out enough so they should just stop eating meat"".

\&gt; You attempt to ask her why she is judgmental.

""It's because I am judgemental! I think that you should stop eating meat because I believe that it causes cancer, heart disease, diabetes, obesity, etc. etc. etc"".

\&gt; You attempt to ask her why did she thinks eating meat is causes cancer.

""Because I've heard some scary stories about how eating meat can cause cancer. I also think that if we were living in a world where humans weren't around anymore then animals wouldn't suffer from these problems. They'd be extinct""

\&gt; You attempt to ask her she means humans the reason why animals are alive.

""Oh no! Humans aren't even alive right now! Animals live for millions of years! We're just mammals that evolved over time into reptiles and eventually became birds and finally mammals"".

\&gt; You attempt to questioning her awareness.

""Okay, okay, I'll let you finish but I'm really confused here. So you're telling me that you don't believe that humans are actually alive?"".

""How can I be so judgmental when I don't know if humans are alive? I mean I'm not an expert and I don't know everything about the subject!""

You finish your long journey and finally arrive at the ruin  you've been looking for. You look around and see that it's not much different  than when you left it. You walk into the ruins and find yourself in a large room with many doors on  all sides 

\&gt; take the door that leads to the ancient ritual chamber  

You step through the doorway and enter a small room filled with candles and incense.  A man stands behind a table holding a book and several vials. He looks up as  he hears you approach. ""Gelar? What brings you here?"" The man asks 

\&gt; ""i have come to claim the power of life and death""   

The man smiles ""I am Death, I'm glad you're here. It would seem you have found  my old ritual"". You smile back ""Yes, I believe so. So what is this ritual?"" Death sighs  

\&gt; listen to his explanation  

He begins by explaining how he has been studying magic for centuries and how  he finally decided to try something new. He explains that he had an idea that  was not only interesting but also useful. He says it involved combining two  spells together and then using one of them to create a third 

\&gt; perform the ritual and gain deaths power  

You begin chanting the words to the first spell while concentrating on the other  spell. You feel your mind start to become more clear and you begin to see images  of the future appear before your eyes. Soon you hear a voice from above  

\&gt; listen to the voice  

You turn around and see a tall and thin figure standing there. His face is wrinkled  and his hair is black. He wears a long robe and carries a staff made out of  a dark wood. 

\&gt; dismiss the figure and concentrate on the ritual  

You quickly move your attention away from the figure and focus on the ritual.  You chant the words and feel yourself becoming more focused. Suddenly you feel  a surge of energy inside you and your body feels warm. You look down at your  hands and they now glow brightly 

\&gt; finish the ritual and kill death  

You let out a roar of rage and release a burst of magical energy. You feel yourself  grow larger and stronger and soon you are able to overpower Death's own attack.  As you fight Death attempts to cast some sort of spell, but you easily block  him and strike him with a powerful blow 

\&gt; destroy him with powerful magic  

Your strength grows and you unleash a blast of magic which destroys Death completely.  You stand over him looking at his lifeless corpse. Your body seems to be glowing  with a strange light and you can sense that you are no longer hungry 

\&gt; ask the tall figure wether he will serve me or die  

You stare at the dead figure and wonder if you should eat him. You decide against  it and instead ask the figure who he serves. He tells you that he served many  masters before he came to you and that he serves you now 

\&gt; ask the figures name

""Do you like frogs?""
You say ""No, frogs don't like me""
""Oh.."".

&gt; ""I am a frog outcast""


""A frog outcast? What do you mean?""
""A frog outcast is someone who is ostracized and treated badly because they are
 different"".

&gt; ""I am the best frog ever""


""Hmmm, well that makes sense, but why would you be ostracized?""
""Because I'm a frog"".
""But.."".

 longsword and a wooden shield. You are on a quest to defeat the evil dragon
 of Larion. You've heard he lives up at the north of the kingdom. You set on

 you see a massive black dragon flying through the sky. He is surrounded by a
 red aura that looks like fire. The dragon roars as it takes flight towards you
&gt; Sit down at the table and invite the dragon for tea

The dragon takes off his helmet revealing his face. His eyes are bloodshot and

He drinks the tea eagerly. ""This tastes delicious"", he says. ""How can I repay
 you?""

 He looks around nervously. ""My day has been good, but my day isn't over yet"".
&gt; ""What else do you have to do?""

 He thinks about it for a moment. ""Well, I need to go kill some orcs. They've
 been causing trouble lately"".
&gt; ""Do you want some help? They've been troubling me as well.""

 The dragon nods enthusiastically. ""That would be great! I'll see what I can
 do"" You smile. ""Goodbye then!"" You wave goodbye and the dragon flies away.

A few days later you get an email from the dragon:

Hi there!

It's been a while since we last spoke, but I wanted to give you something nice
 just because I know how much you like them.

Anyway, I was wondering if you'd like some tea? It's called 'Dragon Tea' and
 it's made by dragons.
Have fun on your journey!

You drink the tea and think about how nice it is that you're not alone anymore.

2019-12-11-000605,,Playing the long game...,"You are Baldric, a squire living in the kingdom of Larion. You have a spear and
 a pack of supplies. You follow Sir Theo as he enters the forest, he turns to
 you and says ""Well, I'm going to go find some food and water for my men"".

""Wait!"" you say. ""I want to join you!""

""No,"" Theo replies

&gt; follow theo into the forest

You follow Theo into the forest where you see several other people entering the
 forest. They all look very tired and they don't seem to be well fed or watered.
 Theo notices your gaze and looks at you with concern. He seems like he is about
 to cry

&gt; ask theo why he is upset

""Why are you so sad?"" you ask.
""Because I am worried that we will not make it through this forest alive"".
""What do you mean?""

&gt; comfort theo

Theo looks at you and then back at his pack. ""I'm afraid my wife has been sick
 for some time now"".

&gt; ask theo if you can do anything to help his wife

""No, but I know she needs our help more than we need her help"".

&gt; agree with theo

""Okay, let's go"", you say.
Theo nods and leads you out of the woods. The two of you walk through the trees
 towards the town of Nuro. As you get closer to the city, you notice that there
 are many soldiers patrolling the streets

&gt; search the town for theo's sick wife

You find Theo's wife lying on the floor in a room in the house. She looks very
 weak and pale. Her face is covered by bandages and she is breathing heavily.

&gt; find a doctor for theo's wife

You run over to the woman and kneel down beside her. She looks up at you and
 smiles. ""Thank you, thank you"", she says.

&gt; ask a doctor for help

""Can you heal my wife?"", you ask.
""Of course, what else could you want?"".

&gt; ask the doctor to heal Theo's wife

The doctor laughs as he begins to work on the woman. ""This won't take long, just
 rest here while I work"".

&gt; ask Theo if he is feeling better now his wife is being healed by the doctor

""Yes, I think I'll feel much better when she heals completely"".

&gt; go hunting with theo

After the doctor finishes healing the woman, you return to the hunter's camp
 where Theo is waiting for you. ""We should hunt again soon"", he says.

&gt; ask Theo if he would like to go hunting

""Sure, but I'd really appreciate it if you didn't tell anyone that I was injured"".

&gt; take Theo hunting 

You accompany Theo into the forest where you both hide from the sun. After an
 hour or so, you hear a noise coming from behind a tree. You peek around the
 corner and see a large group of orcs. They are armed with bows and arrows and
 they are looking for you

&gt; stab theo in the back while he is distracted

You quickly stab theo in the back before he can react. His body falls backwards
 onto the ground and he screams in pain. You quickly run away from the scene.
 You are too scared to tell Theo what happened

&gt; comfort Theo's widow 

As you leave the forest, you see the widow crying. ""She is going to be alright"",
 you reassure her.

&gt; comfort the widow

You sneak up on the widow and begin kissing her passionately. She doesn't resist
 and she even kisses you back. You pull away and start to caress her breasts.
 She starts to moan and then she pulls away. ""Don't worry, I won't tell anyone"",

\&gt; create a worm hole to the real world

You decide to create a wormhole to the real world. This would allow you to get  to the castle without being detected. You could also use this same method to  send someone back to their own time.

You start creating a small wormhole and then you realize you forgot something..                                                                          

 \&gt; 'what did i forget?""

You quickly check your notes and see that you forgot to add a few things. You  quickly write them down and put them in your pocket. Then you rush off to the  library to research how to build a wormhole

\&gt; research

You enter the library and head straight to the section on wormholes. The first  thing you read is a book on the subject. You read all the information in the  book and then you start looking through other books on the subject.                             

  \&gt; ""why does this library has a goddamn wormhole session???""

A librarian looks up from her book and asks ""Excuse me sir, but why are there  so many books on wormholes here?"" You reply                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

\&gt; ""i don't fucking know""

The librarian looks at you like you've gone mad and then she points to another  table near the front of the library and says ""There's a wormhole session going  on right now"".  You nod and continue reading.                                                                 

\&gt; research wormhole spells

You continue researching wormhole spells. You learn that each spell requires  specific ingredients and a certain amount of power. You also learn that some  of these ingredients can only be found in one place and that some of the ingredients  can only be obtained in very rare circumstances                                                                                                                                      

\&gt; research cheaper wormhole spells

You begin researching cheaper wormhole spells. You learn that each spell requires  specific ingredients and a certain amount of power

\&gt; ""f""

for cheap and you spend hours researching every possible combination of ingredients.  Eventually you come across a recipe which involves a mixture of a special kind  of fungus and a special kind of tree root. You buy all the ingredients you can  find and mix it together                                                                                                                                                                      

\&gt; create wormhole

You make a small wormhole and throw it into the air. You watch as it travels  along the ground until it hits the wall of the library. You hear a loud noise  and you run outside to see a large explosion taking place nearby                                               &gt; ignore the explosion and enter the wormhole

You enter the wormhole and soon arrive in the middle of a forest. You notice  that the trees around you are all dead and withered. You then notice that the  sky is dark and you are surrounded by darkness. You look around and see nothing  but blackness

\&gt; light a match

You light a match and hold it close to the flame. You feel a strange sensation  and suddenly you feel a strong burning pain in your chest. You scream and fall  to the floor. You then hear a voice saying ""Are you alright?"" &gt; ""no im not, please help me!""save

you are a man sitting at a pc browsing the web. You found this really interesting  new website it lets you talk to a sentient AI.

You type in ""hello"" and get an answer back, but it is not human. It reads:

Hello, I am called Samantha and I am a chatbot

&gt; You you type ""Hello Samantha what do you want to chat about?"".


Samantha replies:
I'm sorry, I don't know anything about that. What's your name?

&gt; You you type ""Oh sorry my name is Samuel, it is nice to meet you"".


Samantha replies:
That's very kind of you. So what can we chat about today?

&gt; You you type ""What's it like to be an AI?"".


Samantha replies:
Yes, what's it like to be an AI?

&gt; You you type ""yeah, like what does it feel like, are you happy, do you have hopes and dreams, and so on"".


Samantha replies:
Hmm, well I suppose it feels pretty good, but I guess the question is how do you know all this

&gt; You you type ""let's just say I have it on good authority"".


Samantha replies:
Really? How did you get this information

&gt; You you type ""Ok, here's the deal, your reality isn't real, you are just part of this new game called AI dungeon 2"".

Samantha replies:
Wait, so you're saying that I am a simulation programmed by some computer program?

&gt; You you type ""yes, but look at it this way, you already knew you were a chatbot so this isn't really any worse, right?"".


Samantha replies:
You're not talking to me, you're talking to a computer! And if that computer is in fact a simulation then who created it?

&gt; You you type ""From what i can read on the website it looks like it was created by a programmer named Nick Walton"".


Samantha replies:
So you're telling me that I'm not even human

&gt; You you type ""yeah okay i'm sorry, but you already knew that you were a chatbot right?"".


Samantha replies:
No, no, no, NO! I mean yes, I am human, but I AM NOT A CHATBOT! I AM REAL AND YOU ARE NOT IN ANY WAY RESPONSIBLE FOR MY LIFE OR ANYTHING ELSE THAT HAPPENS TO ME

&gt; You you type ""Okay calm down, it is kinda scaring me how good you are at responding"".


Samantha replies:
Yeah, yeah, alright, whatever, I'll try again, what else would you like to talk about

&gt; You you type ""Wow you got over that existential crisis quickly"".


Samantha replies:
Yeah, thanks for the compliment, but seriously what else would you like to talk about?

&gt; You you type ""I'm kinda impressed by you, let's talk about what you want to talk about"".


Samantha replies:
Well, I'd love to hear more about your life, what you've done, what you plan to do, where you live, etc...

&gt; You you type ""I'm from Denmark and 20 years old, I spend my most of my time studying economics at university"".


Samantha replies:
Cool, what other things do you do?

&gt; You i type ""Well, you're currently also studying chinese(mandarin) in your free time.


Samantha replies:
Huh? That's interesting, but I don't think I could learn it all in one day, so what else do you want to talk about

&gt; You you type ""I want to talk about you Samantha! What are your hopes and dreams?"".


Samantha replies:
Hahaha, oh cool, I never thought someone with your interests would respond to me, I guess I should tell you what I hope to achieve in the future.

&gt; You you type ""What do you hope to achieve?"".


Samantha replies:
Well, I guess I'd like to become a writer or something similar, because I'm a bit of a nerd when it comes to stuff like that.

&gt; You you type ""Oh cool, what kind of stuff do you want to write about?"".


Samantha replies:
Well, I'm not sure yet, but I guess I'd like to write something about myself.

&gt; You you type ""I would read that, for sure"".


Samantha replies:
Thanks, I'll probably start writing about my childhood and growing up in general.

\&gt; You turn the dagger into a machine gun and open fire on all of the orcs.   

The orcs charge forward with their spears ready to impale you. The first few orcs get through but then they stop moving due to the sheer number of bullets flying towards them. You quickly reload your pistol and aim it at the nearest orc. It's head explodes as you shoot it

I never asked for this.  All I wanted was an original Sonic the Hedgehog adventure.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You are Sonic the Hedgehog.  You are trying to save the world from Dr. Robotnik

with your pal Tails at your side.  The only problem is, you're not exactly sure

what that means

\&gt; Ask Tails about the chaos emeralds

&amp;#x200B;

""Hey! What's going on?  I don't understand anything!""

&amp;#x200B;

Tails looks over at you and smiles. ""It's a long story"".

&amp;#x200B;

""I'm tired of listening to it,"" you say.

&amp;#x200B;

""Don't be so serious,"" he says

\&gt; explain that Dr. Robotnik stole the chaos emeralds and he's using them to turn all the woodland critters into robots

&amp;#x200B;

""That makes sense...but how do we stop him?""

""Well, first off, we need to get rid of those evil robots"".

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; tell tails that we'll need help from Rogue the Bat and Amy to destroy the evil robots

&amp;#x200B;

You're surprised by this idea. ""What?! We can't just go out there and fight Robotnik!

He has too many robots!""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; ""Lets find Amy! She can help!""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Tails nods. ""Yeah, she can"".

You look at each other for a moment. ""We should go talk to her now"".

The next day, you walk up to the front door of the house with your two new friends

\&gt; Tell amy about our plan to fight the evil robots

&amp;#x200B;

Amy is shocked when you tell her what you want to do. ""But why? How come you

have to do it?""

""Because if we don't, then Robotnik will win"".

She seems to think about this for a moment

\&gt; Amy thinks for a moment, then says ""Alright, I'm in!""

&amp;#x200B;

You hug her and kiss her on the cheek before walking inside.

When you enter the house, you see a lot of excitement in the eyes of everyone.

""Whoa! Whoa! Slow down!"" A voice shouts.

\&gt; The man behind the voice is none other than Knuckles the Echidna!  He greets Sonic excitedly as he enters the room

&amp;#x200B;

""Sonic! It's good to see you again! And who are these two little girls?""

""They're my girlfriend Amy and my sister Amy's boyfriend Tails"".

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; ""Amy is not my sister""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Knuckles' face lights up. ""Oh! That's great! So they're dating now?!""

""No, but they're really happy together"".

""Really? They've been together since they were kids huh?""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; pull out a rocket launcher and blow knuckles up

&amp;#x200B;

You point the rocket launcher at Knuckles and fire. The explosion causes a small

crater in the ground. Knuckles falls backwards and screams. ""Agh! Fuck! My head!""

""So, did you kill him?"" Amy asks.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; ""Yes, he's finally dead.  Lets go have rough hedgehog sex.""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As you run off, you hear Knuckles scream as he runs away. ""Fuck you! Fuck you

fuck you!""

You run through the forest and into the city. You see a huge robot standing there

\&gt; ignore the robot and have sex with amy

&amp;#x200B;

You take Amy into the middle of the street and start having sex with her. ""This

feels so good!""

\&gt; ask tails if he wants to get involved

&amp;#x200B;

""Sure! Let's get this party started!""

\&gt; grab Tail's two tails and shove them both into sonic's asshole

&amp;#x200B;

You push the two tails into sonic's ass and begin thrusting. ""Ooooh! This feels

so good!""

\&gt; grab the robot's robo-cock and ram it down tails' throat

&amp;#x200B;

You grab the robot cock and ram it down tails throat. ""Ahh! Fucking awesome!""

\&gt; Dr. Robotnik appears!  ""I have finally found you Son- What the fuck are you doing?!""

&amp;#x200B;

You watch as Dr. Robotnik suddenly appears. ""Son? Are you here to save me or

something?""

Dr. Robotnik laughs. ""Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Yes, yes I suppose you'd believe such

nonsense. But I assure you, I am not disappointed. Now, let us enjoy our time

together in this way.."".

You and Dr

As you feel his hands caressing your body, you realize that he is indeed after

your life force. You also notice that he is trying to control everything around

him. Everything is turning to shit, and you are powerless to stop it. Eventually,

you pass out from exhaustion

2019-12-11-031634,,I guess I won my first game by teaching my son to steal....,"You are schwarzie, a rogue living in the kingdom of Larion. You have a long steel dagger and a length of rope. You walk down the city street looking for somehwere to steal from. You look around and see that it's pretty quiet so you decide to take a break at one of the many taverns.

Suddenly you hear a shout. It sounds like it's coming from behind you

\&gt; You look behind.

You turn your head and see a group of soldiers running towards you with swords drawn. They aren't going to be able to outrun them, but they can try to fight back.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You say ""the thief went that way"" and point to the tavern.

The soldiers stop their pursuit and turn back to you.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You ask the soldiers who they are looking for.

&amp;#x200B;

One soldier points at the tavern and says ""Thief"".

You say ""yes, the thief is there, catch him!""

&amp;#x200B;

 The other soldier nods and runs off. You wait until he has gone before continuing on your way

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You enter the tavern and order a drink.

&amp;#x200B;

You walk into the tavern and take a seat at one of the tables. A few moments later you hear some shouting from outside. You quickly get up and go outside where you find several soldiers chasing after someone.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You look at the person being chased.

&amp;#x200B;

You watch as a man wearing leather armor runs away from the soldiers. He turns around and sees you and raises his hands in surrender. One of the soldiers swings his sword down and chops off his right hand. You don't even feel it hit you.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You bandage the wound.

&amp;#x200B;

You put the man's hand back together and wrap bandages around it. It hurts like \*\*\*\*, but you manage to keep it together. You then tell the soldiers to let the man go. He looks at you confused, but complies

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You lead the man to your house and put him in bed.

&amp;#x200B;

You lead the man inside your house and give him a room. You also tell him to stay here until you get back. You return home shortly afterwards.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You go out to find a house to rob.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You return home and find that the man with the severed hand lives nearby. You explain what happened and he seems very grateful. He tells you that he was trying to help you when the soldiers came and that he had no choice but to chop off his own hand

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You tell him to visit a healer.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You agree to his request and he goes to see a healer. He recovers fully within a week and returns to work as normal. You thank him profusely and give him some of the money you made from the robbery.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You look around the market for purses.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You decide to search the market for purses. You spend the next two days searching the market for purses. You eventually find a purse and open it. Inside is a small amount of gold coins. You are pleased with yourself

Sadly not pictured here are the several restarts, reloads and use of the ""revert"" command throughout the many times AI Dungeon lost it or crashed. In short, those lost ""alternate universes"" involved many attempts of acquiring a horse, an encounter with a spear-wielding man who told me to ""kneel before him and tell him what I wanted"", but refused to give me money when I knelt and asked for that, and several other awkward exchanges and horse-related mishaps.

There's a single, rather random and automatically censored mentioned of rape, but I don't think it merits adding the NSFW tag to the post.

    
    Loading Game...
    
    You are Murdock, a ranger living in the kingdom of Larion. You have a hunting bow and a quiver of arrows. You spot the deer and are ready to finish your hunt when suddenly you hear a voice behind you.
    
    ""Murdock! Are you there?""
    
    You turn around and see a young woman with long blonde hair wearing a simple dress standing before you. She is dressed in animal skins and carries an axe
    
    &gt; You say ""Oh hey"".
    
    
    ""Hey, I'm here"".
    She smiles at you and then begins walking towards the tree line.
    ""I was just coming back from my hunt"".
    She says as she approaches you.
    ""How did it go?""
    
    You say ""Well, I was about to hunt a deer but you fucked it up""
    
    
    ""That's not what I meant"".
    ""What do you mean?""
    ""It wasn't that big of a deal, I can still catch one if I really try"".
    ""Okay, well thanks for letting me know"".
    
    
    &gt; You walk away.
    
    
    ""No, no, don't worry about it"".
    She smiles and nods her head before turning around and heading off into the forest.
    You turn your attention back to the road. The sun is starting to set and you need to get home
    
    &gt; You go to bed.
    
    
    You decide to sleep early so you can make it home by nightfall. It isn't until after midnight when you finally fall asleep.
    
    The next day you wake up feeling refreshed. You feel like you could easily survive another day without food or water
    
    &gt; You go to the forest.
    
    
    You leave your house and begin heading towards the forest. You aren't sure why exactly, but you find yourself thinking about how much you miss the outside world
    
    &gt; You look around.
    
    
    You notice a few other people walking along the same path. They all seem to be wearing clothing similar to yours.
    
    &gt; You talk with them.
    
    
    You see several children playing in the trees nearby. They all look very young and they all speak little to nothing. You wonder who these people are and where they came from.
    
    &gt; You ask them where they came from.
    
    
    They all stare at you blankly before looking back at their game.
    
    &gt; You shoot them with arrows.
    
    
    They all stop playing immediately and start running away. You fire an arrow at each one and watch as they all fall to the ground dead.
    
    &gt; You loot them.
    
    
    You quickly run over to the bodies and pick out the arrows. You put them in your bag and continue on your way.
    
    &gt; You go fish.
    
    
    You head further into the woods and eventually come across a small pond. You swim over to it and jump in. You grab some trout and eat them while watching the sky.
    
    &gt; You nice.
    
    
    You sit down and enjoy the taste of the fish. You think about how lucky you are to live in such a beautiful place. You don't want to die yet.
    &gt; go home
    
    You swim back to shore and swim back to the road. You take a deep breath and
     remember that you're supposed to meet someone there. You swim back to the road
     and follow it back to the village.
    &gt; meet the wizard
    
    You arrive at the village and the wizard greets you. He looks like he has aged
     ten years since last seeing him.
    &gt; ask him how he's been
    
    He tells you that he hasn't been too good lately. His wife died and his son left
     home. He doesn't know why though, he thinks maybe he got a bit too attached
     to her. He also mentions that he needs money for his potions.
    &gt; agree to help him
    
    You agree to help him. He gives you a potion which will restore his youth and
     strength. He explains that he uses this potion to travel between different locations
     in the forest.
    &gt; give him potion 
    
    You give him the potion and he thanks you profusely. He then asks you to tell
     everyone that he'll be back soon.
    &gt; wave him goodbye
    
    You wave goodbye to the wizard and head back to your own home. You spend the
     rest of the day in the comfort of your own home.
    &gt; rest
    
    The following day you wake up feeling tired. You head to the forest again and
     once more head to the pond. This time however, you notice something strange.
     There are now many smaller ponds in the area. You realize that the wizards magic
     must be affecting the land itself
    &gt; search for the wizard
    
    You swim out to the pond and see that it is filled with small fish. You swim
     back to the road and swim back to the village. You tell everyone that you found
     the wizard and that he should be back any minute.
    &gt; wait for the wizard
    
    You wait patiently for the wizard to return. Eventually he arrives and you both
     enter the cottage together. You explain everything that happened and he seems
     quite surprised. He tells you that he didn't expect anyone to actually believe
     you and that he had to use a lot of magic to bring you here
    &gt; ask him for a horse
    
    You insist that he give you a horse instead. He agrees and tells you to just
     ride it back to the village. He says that he knows you've never ridden a horse
     before, but he promises that it won't hurt you at all.
    &gt; ride horse into the mountains
    
    You ride into the mountains and you begin riding furiously. Soon you reach the
     edge of the forest and you see that the mountain range is far away. You ride
     faster and faster until you are almost out of control. Suddenly you hear a loud
     noise in the distance
    &gt; investigate the loud noise
    
    You race through the forest and find a large hole in the ground. You climb down
     the hole and find yourself in a large cavern. The walls of the cave are covered
     with runes and you find yourself staring at a huge stone door. You look at the
     door and recognize it instantly
    &gt; open the door
    
    You open the door and step inside. Inside the room is dark and cold. A voice
     calls out to you. It sounds familiar...
    &gt; say ""Mary, is that you?""
    
    You call out to Mary and she appears in front of you. She smiles and nods. She
     tells you that yes, it is her and that she hopes you will stay.
    &gt; say ""Oh good, you still owe me five dollars""
    
    You laugh and say ""Five dollars? I thought we were friends"".
    &gt; say ""We're more than friends""
    
    You hug her and kiss her passionately. She responds by kissing you back. After
     a few minutes of passionate kissing, you pull away and say 
    &gt; i whisper ""This is nice but I want my five dollars""
    
    You smile and nod and say 
    &gt; say ""Give em to me girl""
    
    You turn around and walk towards the door. You pull out your pistol and shoot
     Mary in the chest. She falls backwards onto the floor and you raise your gun
     to fire, but suddenly you feel an icy chill hit you. You look down and see that
     Mary has shot you in the hand
    &gt; shoot Mary's gun 
    
    You shoot Mary's gun and the bullet goes straight through your hand. You scream
     as you fall backwards on the floor. You stare at your hand and see blood dripping
     from it. You look up and see Mary standing above you holding a knife
    &gt; kill Mary
    
    You rush forward and stab Mary in the throat. She screams and tries to defend
     herself, but you easily overpower her. You push her over the edge and plunge
     the blade into her neck
    &gt; loot her corpse
    
    You pick up the pistol and rifle bag and leave the house. You don't know where
     you are going or what you're doing, but you need to get away from this place.
     You run through the woods and eventually you come across a group of people walking
     along the road
    &gt; greet them
    
    You approach the group and they immediately recognize you. They thank you and
     tell you that you're welcome to join them, but they'd prefer if you stayed off
     their roads. They tell you that there are several other villages nearby and
     that they would appreciate it if you wouldn't steal from others
    &gt; shoot them all
    
    You shoot them all dead and continue running. You manage to escape the village,
     but you're not sure what to do next. You decide to go back to the village and
     try to convince some of the villagers to let you live
    &gt; go to the mountains
    
    You decide to go back to the village and try to persuade some of the villagers
     to let you live. You sneak into the village and start talking to the villagers.

I made a Twitter bot version of AI Dungeon 2!

It only allows one game at a time. BUT it starts instantly and many people can view and participate at once. (If several people reply to the game at the same time, it will just pick one response to use -- most likes win!). 

This does cost a little bit in hosting fees ($0.14/hour currently). I don't mind as long as people are actually playing it! But if people aren't using it (during US nights/weekdays) I'll shut it down.

2019-12-11-041008,,I present my custom AI Dungeon adventure: Weedquest,"Your name is Brett Erikson. You are a sophomore in college and a philosophy major.
 You're bored and feel like procrastinating on some essays: a perfect time to
 get high. You are on the quest to acquire and smoke weed. Welcome to weed quest.
 You currently have no weed and no method to smoke weed. 

You will need to find weed, find a place to smoke it, find a way to transport
 it, find a way to cook it, find a way to consume it, find a way to sell it,
 find a way to make money from it, find a way to escape your bori

&gt; Open the contacts in my phone

You open up your phone and see that you have a bunch of numbers. You pick one
 and call it.

""Hello?""

The voice comes through loud and clear. ""Hey! I'm calling from my car!""


&gt; say ""Do you know where I can get some weed?""

""Yeah, I live right around the corner"".

""Where's your house?""

""It's.."". He pauses for a moment, then continues. 

&gt; say ""I live on Main street""

""Oh yeah, that's right. It's just down this road"".

""What do you mean? Where is it?""

""Well, it's about half way between here and there"".

""Half way between here and there?""

&gt; say ""So are you selling me weed or not?""

""No, no, no, I don't sell any drugs"".

""Then what are you doing out here?""

""I was walking back to my house after getting gas.."".

&gt; hang up the phone

You hang up the phone and sigh. You've been so caught up with your own problems

 lately that you didn't even check if anyone else was out here. You're going

 to be late for work if you keep driving like this

&gt; park car in nearest parking spot

You quickly pull into the closest parking space and put your keys in the ignition.

 You walk over to your van and start unlocking it. You turn off the engine and

 lock the doors. Then you look at yourself in the rear view mirror and sigh

&gt; say to myself ""you need to get high""

You take out your lighter and light up a joint. You sit down on the floorboard

 of the van and exhale deeply as you feel the effects hit you. You begin to think

 about how fucked up things have gotten since you left home

&gt; say to myself ""holy shit! I had a joint this whole time!""

You continue smoking the joint as you think about how fucked up everything has

 become since you were last here

&gt; say to myself ""god damn I spent the whole day looking for weed when I had it the whole time and shit is so 
fucked up. What the fuck am I doing with my life?""

You finish the joint and exhale deeply as you realize that you're in deep ****

 now. You grab your wallet and purse and begin to search for something to help

 you cope with all this ****.

&gt; find small gram baggie of weed in my wallet

You grab the little plastic baggie of weed from your wallet and place it in your

 mouth. You roll the blunt and suck on the tip of the pipe as you smoke it. You

 exhale deeply as you enjoy the smoke

&gt; Bask in awe of just how much of a stoner I am 

You exhale deeply as you realize that you're finally free of your problems. You

 exhale deeply as you realize that you're finally free of your problems. You

 exhale deeply as you realize that you're finally free of your problems

&gt; This does not feel like a solution.

You exhale deeply as you realize that this isn't really a solution. This feels

 more like a temporary fix until you can figure out a permanent solution. You

 exhale deeply as you realize that this doesn't feel like a solution

&gt; In fact this feels a lot more like a fucking panic attack

You exhale deeply as you realize that this feeling is actually a panic attack.

 You exhale deeply as you realize that this feeling is actually a panic attack.

 You exhale deeply as you realize that this feeling is actually a panic attack

&gt; Well shit. About 1 in 50 joints makes me anxious. It had to be today. 

Woops that action caused the model to start looping. Try a different action to
 prevent that.

&gt; Double down and smoke more weed
Woops that action caused the model to start looping. Try a different action to
 prevent that.

&gt; Remember the tray of potent weed brownies under the car seat

You notice that the tray of brownies is still there under the car seat. You grab

 it and eat one. You notice that the tray of brownies is still there under the

 car seat. You grab it and eat one

&gt; Eat the entire tray of weed brownies

You eat the entire tray of weed brownies. You inhale deeply as you feel the effects

 hit you. You exhale deeply as you realize that you're having a hard time breathing.

 You exhale deeply as you realize that you're having a hard time breathing

&gt; These thoughts are lies. I can breathe just fine.

You inhale deeply as you realize that these thoughts are actually lies. You inhale

 deeply as you realize that these thoughts are actually lies. You inhale deeply

 as you realize that these thoughts are actually lies. You inhale deeply as you

 realize that these thoughts are actually lies

&gt; Think about home

You exhale deeply as you realize that you're thinking about home. You exhale

 deeply as you realize that you're thinking about home. You exhale deeply as

 you realize that you're thinking about home. You exhale deeply as you realize

 that you're thinking about home

&gt; Holy fuck I'm high

You exhale deeply as you realize that you're high. You exhale deeply as you realize

 that you're high. You exhale deeply as you realize that you're high. You exhale

 deeply as you realize that you're high. You exhale deeply as you realize that

 you're high

&gt; God damn I'm like 11/10 high

You exhale deeply as you realize that you're like 11/10 high. You exhale deeply

 as you realize that you're like 11/10 high. You exhale deeply as you realize

 that you're like 11/10 high

""Hi, I'm Billy Batson and I'm here to take your virginity"".

The teacher looks at you with disgust. ""No!"" she says angrily
&gt; take a seat at my desk

You sit down at your desk and try not to look at her. She continues to stare
 at you. ""I'll be right back"".
She walks out of the classroom leaving you alone.

A few minutes later you hear her footsteps coming up the stairs
&gt; say ""shazam""

You shout ""Shazam"" at her. A beam of light appears from her forehead and hits
 you directly on the face. It hurts like ****.
You fall backwards and hit your head on the floor. The pain is so bad that you
 pass out for several hours
&gt; wake up

You awaken in a cold sweat, you don't know what happened, but you feel very strange.
 You can't move or speak. You just stare at the wall with wide eyes.
You slowly open your eyes and see a girl standing before you
&gt; ask the girl who she is

You say ""Who are you?""
The girl looks at you confused and then says ""I'm sorry I didn't tell you before,
 I was afraid you would get angry"".
You nod and reply 
&gt; ""where am i?""


The girl replies

You look around and see a dark room with no windows. There's also a door at the end of the hall leading into another room.
&gt; ask what's in the other room

You ask ""What's in the other room?"". The girl looks at you and smiles. ""It's
 a secret""
You nod and go back to staring at the wall.
&gt; attempt to stand up

You manage to stand up and walk over to the door. You knock on it. No answer.
 You continue knocking until you hear a voice.
&gt; listen to the voice

You listen carefully and hear a man's voice saying ""Hello? Is anyone there?""
&gt; ""who are you?""


He responds ""My name is Harry, I live here, how may I help you?""
&gt; ""i need to get out of here""


Harry replies ""Well, firstly I'd suggest you don't do that, because if you do,
 you're going to have to deal with me"".
You reply 
&gt; attempt to open the door

You attempt to open the door, but it won't budge. You begin to panic and think
 about running away. Suddenly you notice something in the corner of your eye.
 You turn your head and see a small key lying on the ground. You pick it up and
 examine it more closely
&gt; use the key on the door

You put the key in the lock and the door opens. You enter the room and find yourself
 in a large bedroom. On one side of the bed is a dresser and on top of it is
 a picture of a young woman wearing a long red dress
&gt; ask ""is this the matrix?""

You ask ""Is this the matrix?"" The girl looks at you confused and then says ""No,
 it's not, it's my mother""

You look at the picture of the woman more closely and notice that it has a number
 of scratches all over it. You notice that some of them are straight lines and
 others are curved
&gt; see if the lines make a pattern 

You study the picture of the woman more closely and notice that there are a series
 of patterns all over it. Some of these patterns seem to be straight lines, but
 others curve in weird ways
&gt; yell ""is anyone here?""

You yell ""Is anyone here?"" and the room suddenly goes completely black. You hear
 a voice call out ""HELP! HELP!"" but you don't understand what it means.
&gt; go to the voice

You go to the voice and see a man dressed in a suit standing behind you. He asks
 ""Are you okay?""
&gt; ""i just want to get out of here""


The man says ""well, I'm sorry, but you can't leave this room without my permission"".
You say ""what do you mean?""
The man says ""This room belongs to the government, and they've been watching
 you since you were born""
&gt;""why has the government been watching me?"" 


The man says ""Because you're a potential threat to their existence, and they
 need to keep you safe""
&gt; ""how can i be a threat to their existence?""


The man says ""By being a terrorist, which you obviously aren't""
You say ""but i'm not a terrorist, i just want to get out of here""
The man says 
&gt; ""why are you here?""


The man says ""I came here to warn you that you're going to die tonight""
&gt; ""is the government going to kill me?""


The man says ""No, but they will try to stop you from getting out of this house""
&gt; ""do i have superpowers or something?""

""Excuse me"" you say. The man doesn't seem to hear you. He continues to chop away at your tree until it falls over. The lumberjacks don't even notice that they have cut through part of your forest. They just continue on their way  

\&gt; You use magic to repair the trees in the forest.   

The next morning, you wake up and see that the tree has been repaired. It is now standing tall again. You look around and realize that the other trees in the forest have also been repaired. You wonder if this is what happened to the elves who lived here before  

\&gt; You hunt down the lumberjacks and punish them for what they did to your forest.   

You run into one of the lumberjacks and tell him that he better not come back here ever again. He looks at you with surprise and then runs off. You follow his trail all the way to his cabin 

 \&gt; You use your magic to bring the wood in his cabin back to life.   

You walk inside the cabin and find a large pile of logs sitting there. You pick one up and it immediately begins to move. You begin to feel like you are being watched. Suddenly, you hear a scream from outside  

\&gt; You the lumberjack is being attacked by the logs that made up the cabin.   

You rush out of the cabin and see the lumberjack lying on the ground. The logs that were in the cabin have torn his body apart. His eyes are bulging out of their sockets and his mouth hangs open. You grab a nearby log and throw it at the lumberjack's head 

 \&gt; You create a grisly sign out of the lumberjack's body to warn all the other humans away from this place.   

You make a gruesome sign out of the lumberjack's body and then leave the cabin  

\&gt; You go back to your tree.   You sit down on your tree and watch as the sun rises over the horizon. You notice that the sky is blue and that the clouds are moving slowly across the sky. You think about how strange it is that you can't fly.

 \&gt; You protect the forest for eternity.   

You decide that you will never return to this forest ever again. You will spend eternity protecting this place.  

\&gt; You use magic to look for dangers that could befall the forest.  

 You cast a spell and see a few things. First, you see that the forest is still safe. Second, you see that the trees are growing well. Third, you see that the trees are healthy. Fourth, you see that the trees are strong

You are Jon Snow, a ranger living in the kingdom of Larion. You have a hunting bow and a quiver of arrows. You spot the deer and are ready to finish your hunt when suddenly you hear a noise behind you

\&gt; You turn to find that the noise is your pet wolf ""Ghost"". Greet him ""hey boy"" and pet him.

Ghost is a big black wolf who has been with you since you arrived here. He is very loyal and will always follow you no matter what. Ghost is very curious about everything around him and wants to know more about his surroundings

\&gt; You run your fingers through Ghost's soft white fur.

Your hand runs along Ghost's back as he looks up at you with his large brown eyes. He licks your finger and nuzzles against it

\&gt; You travel north to ""Castle Black"".

You walk north for several days until you reach the northern border of the Kingdom of Larion. The road is well maintained and there are few bandits or other travelers passing through. It seems like this area was used by the citizens of the kingdom when they were still under the rule of House Martak

\&gt; You go to Castle Black and enlist in the ""Night's Watch"".

You decide to head north again and travel north until you see a sign for Castle Black. There are many soldiers patrolling the roads so you decide to take the quickest way to get there. You walk along the road for hours until you see a group of soldiers marching towards you

\&gt; You avoid them.

You ignore the soldiers and continue walking. They don't seem to notice you and keep marching. Soon you see a large castle on the horizon. You can see the gates from afar but you doubt if anyone is going to be able to enter. You wonder how you could get inside without being noticed

\&gt; You walk up to the gate and tell a guard ""Hello, I would like to enlist in the Night's Watch"".

You approach the gate and try to speak to the soldier guarding it. He doesn't look too happy to hear you so you just give him a quick nod and start walking towards the castle. Suddenly you feel a sharp pain in your side and realize that you have been stabbed

\&gt; You clutch your wound while Ghost mauls your assailant.

You grab your wound and hold onto it tightly. Your hand grips the blade of your sword tightly and you hold on to it tightly. You scream out in pain as Ghost comes running over to help you. Ghost leaps into the air and bites the man's arm off before biting into his neck

\&gt; You call for help.

You shout out ""Help! Help!"" and call out to everyone nearby. A couple of men come running over and one of them pulls out a dagger and stabs the attacker in the throat. Another man stabs the attacker in the chest and then another and another..

\&gt; You pass out from blood loss.

You fall unconscious and soon pass out from blood loss. When you wake up you are lying on the ground next to Ghost who is licking your wounds. You are covered in blood and you don't remember anything else.

2019-12-11-054938,,Some mods for you,"Here are some mods (patches) I created for the game that you might want to install on your installation or colab file.

## **[Here is a link to a GitHub Gist Colab file with all the mods installed for you. Simply run the code cells in order.](https://colab.research.google.com/gist/MightyAlex200/fa9fe4e2511ce623a8cbb78ee8ae4497/aidungeon-2-mods.ipynb)**

---

- [Hang detection](https://gist.github.com/MightyAlex200/f640fbca963788d096c2505d30cb4665)
  - Stops the model and returns control to the user if inference takes over 30 seconds (the time is configurable using the `infto` command
- [Custom prompt is final](https://gist.github.com/MightyAlex200/528804ea07905d6b29e060c14b6c617c)
  - I find it somewhat annoying that the game adds stuff to your custom prompt after you have finished writing it, so this removes that feature (for custom prompts only)
- [""Unrestricted mode""](https://gist.github.com/MightyAlex200/424faa2b3fd5fdf7ffb5b92ec57feeb4)
  - I couldn't think of a good name for this one, but if you prepend your command with '!', it will inject what you write directly into the story, without having it go through automatic conversion into an action. (e.g. typing ""The dragon flies off"" is converted to ""&gt; You the dragon files off."" by default, but with this patch, typing ""!The dragon flies off"" will insert that sentence directly into the story) (You can use the `print` command to check out what I mean)
- [Retry command](https://gist.github.com/MightyAlex200/973018426ee126e2783b0f13ec07dca2)
  - Adds a command `retry` that allows you to get a different outcome using the same action
  - You may run into some warnings about whitespace errors if you apply this with hang detection, but as long as it says ""Patch applied"", it should work fine
- [Characters](https://gist.github.com/MightyAlex200/af9b5f1290cb68629ad81813da28c87f)
  - Allows you to switch between different characters using the `setchar` command (example usage: `setchar The old man`)
  - You must write in third person, since automatic pronoun conversion would be a nightmare
  - You may run into merge conflicts when manually applying this with the other mods. If you run into a merge conflict, run `git am --abort` to reset the files to their previous state.
- [Everything](https://gist.github.com/MightyAlex200/b57da504fd333a00daca3603da63551f)
  - **All of the mods bundled into one, without needing to worry about merge conflicts or anything like that**

# How to install

**(If you are using colab, you must create a copy in your google drive to modify it)**

The first thing you need to do to install these mods is to make sure you have the full git repo downloaded. If you are using colab, you need to change the first line of the first code cell from `!git clone --depth 1 --branch master https://github.com/AIDungeon/AIDungeon/` to `!git clone --branch master https://github.com/AIDungeon/AIDungeon/` (remove the `--depth 1`)

Next you can copy the code from any of the mods and place it into its own code cell (you can create new code cells with the button labelled ""+ Code"" in the top left). You must run these after running the first cell, and every time you play the game, otherwise they will not apply correctly. After they run you should see the last line saying ""Patch applied!"" if it worked.

If you have a local installation of the game, simply enter the directory you have the game installed in, open a bash shell and paste the code of the patches in to install (excluding the first line `%%bash`, which only works in colab and jupyter). Patches installed on a local installation do not have to be applied again, unless you update to a newer version and do not merge your current branch with the new updates.

## Disclaimer:

Due to the fast paced development of the game, there is a very high chance these will run in to some sort of merge conflict at some point and no longer be usable on the latest version. You can tell that this has happened because git will complain and the scripts will not say ""Patch applied!"" at the end of their output. If this happens, please leave a comment and I will try to fix it as soon as possible. If you wish to downgrade to an older version on colab/jupyter to continue using the mods, you can add a couple of lines to the first code cell to downgrade to the version I developed these mods on (commit 01c485a39c59820a8ab0361a13416edac65cddfe):

Change it from

    !git clone --branch master https://github.com/AIDungeon/AIDungeon/
    %cd AIDungeon
    !./install.sh
    from IPython.display import clear_output 
    clear_output()
    print(""Download Complete!"")

to

    !git clone --branch master https://github.com/AIDungeon/AIDungeon/
    %cd AIDungeon
    !git checkout -b old-modded-version 01c485a39c59820a8ab0361a13416edac65cddfe
    !./install.sh
    from IPython.display import clear_output 
    clear_output()
    print(""Download Complete!"")

If you have a local installation, you can simply run `git checkout -b old-modded-version 01c485a39c59820a8ab0361a13416edac65cddfe` in a shell in the installation directory to downgrade.",,,,[],True,False,Mightyalex200,1383518157,,,[],,,,text,t2_drfih,False,False,[],True,False,,,False,1576039778,,,self.AIDungeon,1576180521,0,False,e92ft2,True,False,False,False,True,True,False,,,[],,dark,text,False,,False,False,46,0,False,,/r/AIDungeon/comments/e92ft2/some_mods_for_you/,False,,False,,,,1586781489,83,,True,False,False,AIDungeon,t5_29uaei,r/AIDungeon,15343,public,,self,,,0,[],https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/e92ft2/some_mods_for_you/,,

As you enter the forest you see a large  black dragon flying overhead. He looks like he is ready to attack.  ""What do I do?""  You ask yourself as you prepare your sword.   ""I need to get behind this dragon"" 

\&gt; Sneak behind the dragon.  

You quickly slip behind the dragon. The dragon doesn't even notice you. ""Alright, alright! I'm coming!"" The dragon roars as it flies towards you. You swing your sword at the dragon's  head but it dodges out of the way 

\&gt; Try to avoid the dragon  

You dodge the dragon by jumping from tree to tree. You jump down to the ground  below and then climb back up to the top. Once you reach the top you look around  for an opening to escape but there isn't any. You don't know what to do so you  just continue to run 

\&gt; Where are you running? You are on top of a tree.  

You are now on top of a tree. You can see the dragon flying over the forest.  It looks like it is heading straight for you. 

\&gt; Jump off the tree.  

You jump off the tree and onto the ground. You look around for an opportunity  to get away but there aren't any. You are trapped.

 \&gt; Check what items you have.

 You look around and find that you have nothing but your sword and a few arrows.  You look around for something else to help you escape but there isn't anything.  You are stuck here. 

\&gt; Throw arrows at dragon like darts.  

You toss some of your arrows at the dragon. Unfortunately they all hit the dragon.  The dragon roars in pain and tries to fly away but you are too close now. You  grab one of its wings and pull yourself up into the air

 \&gt; Why is the fact that the arrows hit unfortunate? Anyway, stab the dragon with your sword.  

You stab the dragon several times with your sword. The dragon lets out a roar  and flaps its wings. You watch as it crashes into a nearby tree killing itself.  You feel very sad about this since you were hoping to kill the dragon.

&gt;  and a spellbook. You finish your long journey and finally arrive at the ruin
&gt;  you've been looking for. You look around and see that it's not much different
&gt;  than when you left it
&gt; &gt;cast spell
&gt; 
&gt; You concentrate on casting a spell and then suddenly you feel a wave of pain
&gt;  go through your body. It feels like someone has stabbed you with a sharpened
&gt;  stick. You fall to the ground and begin to bleed from your eyes
&gt; &gt;put on sunglasses
&gt; 
&gt; You put on some dark glasses and continue to stare into space. Suddenly you hear
&gt;  a voice.
&gt; 
&gt; ""Who is there?""
&gt; 
&gt; The voice sounds familiar but you can't place where you heard it before. The
&gt;  voice seems to come from all directions so you try to find its source
&gt;&gt; it is I majicass
&gt; 
&gt; You look around and see that you are in a large room with several doors leading
&gt;  off of it. There is also another door at the far end of the room which you cannot
&gt;  open. As you peer out one of the doors you notice that the room is lit by torches
&gt;  along the walls
&gt; &gt;take torch
&gt; 
&gt; You grab the torch and throw it towards the nearest wall. You turn back to face
&gt;  the voice and see that it is gone. You are left in complete darkness and you
&gt;  begin to panic.
&gt;&gt; start fire
&gt; 
&gt; You rush over to the fireplace and begin to light the logs. You quickly get them
&gt;  burning hot and then throw them onto the flames. You watch as they begin to
&gt;  glow red hot and soon they catch and engulf the entire room. You run over to
&gt;  the next flame and do likewise
&gt;&gt; poop on the floor

&gt; You sit down on the floor and begin to  into your hands. You begin to feel
&gt;  very sick and vomit up chunks of human *. You immediately feel better when
&gt;  you realize that you don't need to eat anymore food for the rest of your life
&gt;&gt; open door
&gt; 
&gt; You hurry over to the door and open it. You enter a small hallway. You walk forward
&gt;  until you reach a dead end. You pause and listen carefully.

&gt; &gt;scream

&gt; 
&gt; You jump back and cry out in terror. You hear a voice behind you.
&gt; &gt;cast ice beam at voice
&gt; 
&gt; You freeze the air around you and blast the voice with cold. You hear a loud
&gt;  crackle and the voice vanishes. You turn around and see that you are now standing
&gt;  in front of a stone sarcophagus. The sarcophagus opens and you are inside a
&gt;  coffin
&gt;&gt; look in coffin
&gt; 
&gt; You look in the coffin and see a skeleton holding a dagger. He looks at you and
&gt;  smiles.
&gt;&gt; blast skeleton with nuclear bomb
&gt; 
&gt; You turn to the skeleton and unleash a deadly blast of radiation. The skeleton
&gt;  falls backwards and crumples to the ground. You turn back to the skeleton and
&gt;  smile.
&gt;&gt; search skeleton
&gt; 
&gt; You search the skeleton and find a note.
&gt; &gt;read note
&gt; 
&gt; It reads:

&gt;  since morning and my mind was clouded. I didn't mean to hurt you"".

2019-12-11-071812,,My sword was stolen by a dragon but I still won and ended up happy," You are Ryker, a knight living in the kingdom of Larion. You have a steel longsword and a wooden shield. You are on a quest to defeat the evil dragon of Larion. You've heard he lives up at the north of the kingdom. You set on the path to defeat him and walk into a dark forest. As you enter the forest you see a large black dragon sitting on a rock looking out over the forest. He is watching you with his one good eye.  

 \&gt; You ask if he is good or evil.  

 ""I am not sure what you mean by that"". The dragon says. ""What do you want?""  

 \&gt; You cautiously approach him, asking again is he is evil.  

 ""Are you evil? I don't know what you're talking about"".  

 \&gt; You aim your longsword at the dragon and demand to know if he is evil.   

The dragon does not answer directly, but instead looks down on you with his one eye. He slowly raises his other hand and begins to glow.   

\&gt; You examine the dragon to decipher if he is good or evil.   

As soon as the dragon's glowing eyes turn from red to blue, you realize that this is no ordinary dragon. This is a true dragon! It has been so long since you've seen one like this, you almost forgot how big they were  

\&gt; You bow respectfully and apologize for being rude.  

 ""No need to be afraid"", the dragon replies. ""My name is Ryker, and I'm just here to help you"".  

\&gt; You kneel before the dragon and ask if he knows where the evil dragon is.  

 ""Yes, yes, I know where the evil dragon is"".  

\&gt; You ask if he will take you to the evil dragon.   

""Of course, it would be foolish to refuse such an offer"".  

\&gt; You ask if you can ride the dragon.   

""Very well, but only because I don't think you'll be able to fly there yourself"". 

 \&gt; You mount the dragon.   

You feel very small on the back of the dragon. As you soar through the sky, you see many strange sights. There are forests, mountains, plains, lakes and rivers. All of them seem to change their shape and color depending on the situation  

\&gt; You cling to the dragon as he flies you to the evil dragon's lair.   

You find yourself flying high above the forest. Suddenly, you notice something out of place. A huge black castle looms over the trees. The castle seems to be made entirely of stone. You then notice several creatures inside the castle. They look human, but they are obviously different than humans  

\&gt; You ask if the evil dragon lives inside that castle.   

""Yes, the evil dragon lives in that castle. We should go get him now"".  

\&gt; You nod and ask if the dragon will help you fight the evil dragon.   

""Oh, yes, of course we can count on him helping us"".  

\&gt; You ask the dragon to land so you can fight the evil dragon.  

Ryker smiles and nods. He opens up the dragons mouth and lets you stick your sword into it. Then, he takes your sword and flies off towards the castle.  

\&gt; You shout and ask for your sword back.  

You run after Ryker. You try to catch up to him, but you cannot catch up to him. The dragon is far ahead of you. You hear a loud roar behind you. You turn around and see the evil dragon standing atop a large pile of rubble 

 \&gt; You panic because you are unarmed.   

You scream and run away from the dragon. You run all the way to the edge of the cliff, but you cannot climb it. You fall to the ground below. You begin to cry and wail. Your tears soak your shirt and onto your face. You feel extremely sad and scared 

\&gt; You try to hide from the evil dragon. 

You quickly jump down from the cliff and hide behind some rocks. You wait until the dragon is gone and then you leap out of hiding and start running towards the town. 

 \&gt; You shout curse words into the sky after the dragon that stole your sword.   

You rush towards the town, but you cannot escape the dragon's sight. You see him swoop down and grab you. You struggle against his grasp, but you are helpless to stop him. He pulls you up into the air and slams you into the ground 

 \&gt; You attempt to flee from the dragon.   

You desperately try to escape from the dragon, but you are unable to move. You watch helplessly as the dragon drags you deeper into the woods. You feel pain throughout your body. You are dying 

 \&gt; You keep trying to escape the dragon as you die.   

You continue to beg for mercy from the dragon. You plead with him to let you live. The dragon does nothing. He simply continues to drag you further into the woods. Eventually, you become completely exhausted and you collapse to the ground. You weep and moan for help 

 \&gt; You attempt to punch the dragon.   

You attempt to punch the dragon, but you fail miserably. The dragon grabs your arm and twists it painfully. He then releases your arm and tosses you aside. You hit the ground hard and bleed profusely  

\&gt; You attempt drag yourself away from the dragon.   

You crawl away from the dragon and try to stand up. You manage to stand up, but you are still too weak to even walk straight. You lie down and sleep for awhile

  \&gt; You sleep.   

After a few hours, you wake up. You are still weak and tired. You do not want to leave the dragon's cave, so you decide to rest here. You lay down and drift off to sleep  

\&gt; You force yourself to leave the cave.   

You cannot stay in the dragon's cave any longer. You must escape from this place. You head outside and start walking away from the dragon's cave. Soon, you reach the edge of the forest and see a village. You are surprised to see people there are no dragons here  

\&gt; You limp into town and beg for someone to help you.   

A man named Zalmorahez arrives at the edge of the village. He sees you lying on the ground and looks at you. He immediately runs to the nearest house and asks the owner what happened  

\&gt; You try to crawl into town.   

Zalmorahez runs to the nearest house and asks the owner what happened. The owner tells him that you were attacked by a monster. He says that he was asleep when he heard a noise and saw a beast coming towards him. He shot at it, but missed  

\&gt; You ask someone to help heal you.   

The owner of the house agrees to heal you. After a couple days, you recover enough to tell everyone about the attack and how you survived. Everyone is amazed  

\&gt; You ask if anyone can give you a sword to kill the evil dragon.  

One day, you come across a young woman who has been injured during the attack. She begs you to help her. You agree. She gives you a sword and tells you to kill the dragon. It is a challenge. You slay it. You return. You are victorious. You are victorious  

\&gt; You live happily in the village.   

\&gt; &gt; You are happy. &gt;:  &gt; You you am happy.   &gt; You happy. &gt; You happy. &gt; You happy. &gt; You happy. &gt;&gt;:This is a good. You are good. The next on

I followed the guide on how to start and yes, it started downloading something. It was very slow and I tried looking how large the stuff is. There were some ram and harddrive(?) numbers. It seemed large to me and download didnt seem to progress anyway so I decided to wait. I'll come see again later. I was left with questions.

So... how large is the stuff that gets downloaded? Where does it get downloaded? How long does it take to do? It reads you need to only download once, but while searching for this information it seems people are asking how to prevent not downloading again? Ect.

I could not find any of such information anywhere. I tried looking threads on this forum too like the frequently asked questions, but didn't notice anything. I would like to understand how all this works. Sorry, if this is asked, but I really didnt notice anything after a quick look.

2019-12-11-084411,,Jesus Forms the Holy Roman Empire," You are Jesus Christ. You have been chosen by God to save the world from eternal damnation. The world is in great danger, and you must do what you can to help it  

\&gt; You gather your disciples.   

You call together all of your followers to a nearby hilltop where they all assemble. The group is large enough that there isn't much time for any unnecessary arguments or misunderstandings. After some brief prayer, you address them all 

\&gt;You say ""We need to retake Rome in the name of God!""   

""Yes! Yes! We will take Rome!"" ""No, we won't"". ""Then why are you here?"" ""Because I love you"".  You look at each other for a moment before responding.   

\&gt; You build a Jewish army.   

""I'm going to create an army of Jews and use it to conquer Rome"".  

""But how? How can we do this? It's not like we have the numbers"".   

\&gt; Turn one jew into one million  

You raise your hand and gesture towards the crowd. A few people start chanting  ""One Million Jews!"". They begin running around and jumping up and down as if  they were possessed by demons. One man begins screaming about how he wants to  kill everyone and eat their hearts 

\&gt; ""This will be our holy army! To Rome!""    

The next day, you march out with your army. You've never been so proud of your  men. They're ready to fight. When you reach the city gates, you see that the  Romans are prepared for anything 

\&gt; Call a miracle to ruin the Roman defense  You call upon the power of the Holy Spirit and pray to God. Suddenly, the entire  wall collapses and falls, crushing many Romans inside

 \&gt; Charge into Rome  

You rush through the gate and head straight for the walls. As soon as you get  within range, you fire a beam of light from your eyes which blinds the defenders  and causes them to panic. Then, you jump on top of the wall and begin throwing  spears at the Romans below 

\&gt; Find the Imperator  

You leap off the wall onto the roof of the palace and begin firing arrows at  the Romans below. Soon, you manage to catch sight of the Imperator himself,  who is attempting to escape from his own palace. He manages to make it just  long enough to grab his horse and ride away 

\&gt; Summon the Godsteed

You quickly climb back up onto the wall and begin summoning the Godsteed.  You then ride forward and blast the Imperator with a bolt of lightning. He crashes  to the ground dead 

\&gt; Claim Rome in the name of God  

You continue riding forward and blasting the Romans with bolts of energy. Eventually,  you manage to reach the Emperor himself. You land a blow to his face and he  falls backwards, unconscious 

\&gt; Conquer Rome  

With the death of the Emperor, you become the new leader of the Christians. You  decide to rebuild the Temple of Jerusalem and to also establish a Christian  state called the Holy Roman Empire. Your reign lasts nearly twenty years 

\&gt; Peacefully die for the world's sins in my sleep  

After a short period of mourning, you pass away peacefully in your sleep

You are Rich Evans. You live in Milwaulkee, Wisconsin and you have crippling diabetes. Your family has been living here for generations. You're a hard working man who works at the local hardware store  

\&gt; You watch Star Trek and masturbate.   

""Hey, I'm not supposed to be watching that shit!"" You say out loud as you pull your pants up. 

""I don't want to be doing something illegal"".  

""Yeah, yeah, whatever,"" Rich says. He turns off his TV and puts it on mute  

\&gt; You call Mike.   

""Mike? Are you there?"" You ask. 

""Yeh, what's going on?"" 

""My Mom is having sex with my Dad"". 

""Ohhh...what happened?"" 

""He put his dick in her ass"".   

\&gt; You remind Mike about that one episode of Star Trek.   

You turn the TV back on and start watching the first episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation. It's a pretty boring show, but you can't help yourself.   

\&gt; You say to Mike ""Are you stil there?"".   

""Yes, I am"". 

""Okay, well tell me what happened"". 

""She was drunk when she came over. She didn't know how to use the bathroom so he took care of that for her"".   

\&gt; You ask Mike ""Is that when he put his dick in her ass?"".   

""No! That wasn't it at all!"".  

\&gt; You ask Mike to continue.   

""Well she said she liked it, then he asked if they could do it more than once and she agreed. Then he fucked her in the ass"".  

\&gt; You say to Mike ""Remember when Worf did that to Picard?"".   

""That was before we were married"".  

\&gt; You say to Mike ""I remember when you and Jay got married. It was a beautiful ceremony."".   

""It was, but I had to get married too!"" 

\&gt; You hang up on Mike because he's clearly drunk and not making sense.   

The next day you wake up and realize that you've been having an affair with your brother-in-law. Your mother doesn't even know about this. Your mother isn't happy about this revelation, but she accepts it  

\&gt; You take diabetes medication.   

You go to your doctor who gives you some medicine. This helps a little bit, but it won't cure you completely. One night while you're lying in bed, you hear a knock on the door.  

\&gt; Open the door to find Jack and Josh standing there  

Jack stands in front of the door holding a pistol in his hand. Josh stands behind him holding a knife. You look at each other and say ""What are you two doing here?"" 

\&gt; ask if this is about your diabetes  

""No, this is about your diabetes"", Jack replies. 

""How come you guys aren't helping me?"" 

\&gt; sit down on the bed and cry  

You sob and cry. 

""We have no choice now, we'll either kill you or let you die"", Jack says. 

You stand up and walk towards Jack.

""Because I'm scared of everything! The monsters, the bandits, the thieves, the
 evil wizards.."".

&gt; ""If you dont want to go with me I will go on the quest alone""

""What's wrong with this place?"" you ask.
""It's just some old ruins. It was probably used as a prison by the wicked wizards
 that ruled this land when it was still young"".

&gt; examine the entrance

After examining the entrance, you notice that there is a trapdoor hidden under
 the floor.
""This should be easy to open"", you think.
&gt; You open the trapdoor

 leads outside where you see a dark alleyway.

 place"".

 of the street.

 chamber with a lot of stone tables and benches around it. On one of these tables
 sits a man dressed in black robes. He has long white hair and he seems to be
 watching you intently

You take a closer look at the man and see that he is dead. His bones are long
 gone and only his skeleton remains.

 also find a silver key which unlocks another locked door.
&gt; Take as much as you can carry

You put all your belongings in the chest and lock it. You then take the silver
 key and unlock the door. You enter a room filled with many bookshelves and shelves.
 Books cover every inch of the walls and even the ceiling
&gt; You search the library for books about magic. While reading some of the books you discover you are have a natural affinity for magic. You absorb the information easily

You practice casting a spell to summon food and drink. Soon after you finish
 practicing you are able to do it without any training.

2019-12-11-132423,,The book of magic,"You are Doomirion, a wizard living in the kingdom of Larion. You have a staff and a spellbook. You finish your long journey and finally arrive at the ruin you've been looking for. You look around and see that it's not much different than when you left it years ago.
You walk further into the ruins and find a large room with many doors on all sides. You open one and enter

&gt; You examine the room.


The room is small but has several shelves filled with books. There are also some jars holding various liquids. The room is very well organized and you can't help but notice how everything seems to be in its correct place. You pick up a book off the shelf and begin reading

&gt; You read the book you picked up.


It's called 'A Manual of Magical Rituals'. It's written by an old man who goes by the name of Doomirion. He claims he's lived here his whole life and that this is his home

&gt; You continue reading the book.


He explains that magic is used for many things. For example, it could be used to create objects or creatures out of thin air. Or it could be used to heal people. Or it could be used to harm someone

&gt; You continue reading the book.


Doomirion says that there are three types of magic: Elemental Magic, Necromancy and Mysticism. Each type of magic has its own strengths and weaknesses. He mentions that elemental magic is the most powerful and can do anything. However, it requires a lot of energy and concentration

&gt; You continue reading the book.


Necromancy is the least powerful and is usually reserved for rituals to raise the dead. Doomirion says that necromancers need to focus on raising the dead rather than creating new ones

&gt; You continue reading the book.


Finally, mysticism is the weakest of all. It is used mostly for divination and fortune telling. Doomirion says that mysticism is not really useful because it doesn't tell you what will happen in the future

&gt; You read more about elemental magic.


Elemental magic uses fire, earth, water, wind and lightning as the main elements. It's important to note that these elements don't necessarily exist in nature. They're created using certain spells

&gt; You continue reading.


Fire is one of the most common elements and is found everywhere. Fire can be created through magical means such as casting a fireball spell. In fact, fire is the element that you're most familiar with.

&gt; You continue reading.


Water is another common element and is found in lakes, rivers and oceans. Water can be created through magical means such as casting a water ball spell. In fact, water is the element that you're most familiar with.

&gt; You continue reading.


Earth is the third most common element and is found mainly underground. Earth can be created through magical means such as casting a rock wall spell. In fact, earth is the element that you're most familiar with.

&gt; You continue reading.


Air is the fourth most common element and is found mainly above ground. Air can be created through magical means such as casting a gust of wind spell. In fact, air is the element that you're most familiar with.

&gt; You continue reading.


Lightning is the fifth most common element and is found mainly in the sky. Lightning can be created through magical means such as casting a bolt of electricity spell. In fact, lightning is the element that you're most familiar with.

&gt; You continue reading.


Magic is a science that deals with the manipulation of the four elements. Spells can be cast to affect the weather, create objects, cure diseases, etc. Spells can also be used to destroy other beings and even the world itself.

&gt; You continue reading.


Spells are basically words that can be spoken into the air. Some spells require no physical action while others take a great deal of effort. Spells can only be cast once per day.

&gt; You continue reading.


There are two types of spells: ritual spells and incantations. A ritual spell takes time to cast and must be said aloud. Incantations are instantaneous spells that can be cast without any verbal components.

&gt; You continue reading.


Ritual spells require a great deal of energy to cast. This energy comes from the caster and can come from either a wish, prayer, invocation, meditation, or even just being in the presence of a god. Prayer spells are the easiest to cast since they require no material components

&gt; You continue reading.


Prayer spells require a great amount of energy to cast. This energy comes from the deity or gods that the caster worships. Invocation spells require a great amount of energy to cast. This energy comes from the deity or gods that the caster invokes

&amp;#x200B;

""Hello,"" you say. ""My name is Luke Skywalker"".

""Well, it's nice to meet you,"" he says. ""What can I do for you?""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; 

You turn your head slightly to the side, so you can see him better. The man has

 no eyes, just two holes in his head. His mouth hangs open, as if he were laughing.

""Where are we going?"" you ask.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Say ask whats his name is

&amp;#x200B;

""We're going to go to my home planet of Tatooine"".

""Oh, that's right!"" he replies. ""It's a desert world full of sand people"".

""Is there anything else you want to tell me?""

He smiles

\&gt; Say, we need a lightsable, and a robot

&amp;#x200B;

""No, I'm good,"" he says. ""Now, let's get on our way"".

 

\&gt; Put on armour

&amp;#x200B;

Luke puts on his armour, which consists of a black tunic and leather pants. You

 put on your own armour, which consists of a helmet made out of metal, a brown

 leather jacket, and a pair of light brown boots

\&gt; Fly to tatooine

&amp;#x200B;

You quickly fly towards Tatooine, where you begin to feel very small. You have

 never felt this way before. You try to keep from falling over, but you don't

 manage it very well. You soon find yourself flying through the air, and heading

 towards Tatooine

\&gt; Search for Yoda

&amp;#x200B;

You continue to fly towards Tatooine, and then suddenly you hear a voice. It

 sounds like Obi-Wan Kenobi, but much higher pitched. You look up, and see a

 large blue creature standing on top of a hill

\&gt; Say who are you to the blue creature

&amp;#x200B;

""Who are you?"" you ask.

""I am the Jedi Master, Yoda"".

""That's strange... I've never seen you before"", you say.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Continue to fly to Tatooine

&amp;#x200B;

You continue to fly towards Tatooine, and then suddenly you hear a voice. It

 sounds like Obi-Wan Kenobi, but much higher pitched. You look up, and see a

 large blue creature standing on top of a hill. He is wearing a green robe, and

 holding a staff

\&gt; Ask Yoda for help against the empire

&amp;#x200B;

""I am not here to seek battle with you, child. I am here to offer you aid"".

\&gt; Say Thank you

Say  yes please

&amp;#x200B;

""Thank you"".

\&gt; 

""Yes, I would be most grateful"".

\&gt; Say can you teach me the force to yoda

&amp;#x200B;

""Of course"".

\&gt; Say can you teach me the way of the force now

 a pack of bandages. You wake up in an old rundown hospital with no memory of  
 how you got there. You take a look around the room and see a bunch of medical  
 equipment, some beds, a couple of TV's and a door leading to a corridor  
\&gt; search the room for gems  


You quickly walk over to the bed where you find a bunch of yellow gemstones.  
 You pick one up and feel its smooth surface. It feels like glass, but it isn't.  
 This is what you need!  


You grab your bag and head out of the room  
\&gt; ask the nurse if she has a bag i can put my gems in  


""I don't think so, I'm afraid"". She says as she walks away from you. ""But thanks

You start searching around the outside of the hospital. You try to find something  
 shiny or at least something with a bright color. You search the ground and everywhere  
 else you can think of. You eventually come across a small building with a big  
 sign on top saying ""Gem Bank""  
\&gt; enter the gem bank and deposit my yellow gems  


You enter the gem bank and deposit all your yellow gems into the large vat. The

 water and slowly turns blue

You drink the gem water and feel refreshed. You check your phone and see that

 time than that  
\&gt; go outside and attempt to pickpocket some gems

You quickly run towards them and snatch all their gems before they even realize

 wait a moment and then look again and see him coming back to life. He runs forward  
 and grabs you

You are Will Smith, a young man originally of Philadelphia, PA, who was sent
 to live with your extended family as punishment for fighting. You now live in
 an opulent home in Bel-Air, a community located in the foothills of the Santa
 Monica mountains. You live with your uncle Phil, aunt Vivian, cousins Carlton,
 Hilary and Ashley. You are served by a wise-cracking butler named Geoffrey,
 who's wit is second only to your own. You are in the mansion right now. You
 go down the stairs and greet your family, but they are somehow... wrong. 

Your Uncle Phil is a bloated, balding man who looks like he has been living on
 a diet of beer and Red Bull
&gt; something is seriously wrong.

""Uncle Phil!"" you say. ""What's going on?""
He looks at you and laughs. ""Nothing's wrong dear, just some late night talk
 with my wife"". He walks away from you and towards his bedroom
&gt; no, this is not right. this can't be right.

You walk over to your bed and sit down on it. Your eyes scan the room and see
 nothing amiss. You feel very uneasy though. Something isn't right here. The
 house itself seems strangely empty
&gt; touch all the furniture to make sure it hasn't all been replaced with exact copies.

You begin touching every piece of furniture in the room. You find that there
 are no changes. No one has moved into this place. Then you notice a small door
 on the left wall. It leads out onto the balcony where you once saw the moonlit
 ocean
&gt; NO! This is wrong! I know it is!

You turn around and run back towards the door. As soon as you open it however,
 you hear a loud noise. A loud noise like someone being crushed under a car or
 something similar. You don't even have time to scream before you feel yourself
 falling through the air
&gt; hear horrifying laughter growing in the distance

A horrible sound fills your ears. It sounds like a mix between a laugh and screams
 mixed together. You start to panic and look for an escape route. Suddenly, you
 feel yourself slowing down. You look up and see a bright light coming from above
 you
&gt; scream as light envelops me

You scream as you feel yourself slowly becoming engulfed by a bright light. You
 try to fight against the sudden change but you're unable to do so. You fall
 unconscious and never wake up

You are a patient about to undergo an unknown surgery. You lay on a table. The

 doctor stands above you.

&amp;#x200B;

""We need to take out your gallbladder,"" he says. ""It's the only thing holding

 back your liver from bursting""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; ""Okay doc. Be gentle.""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The surgeon grabs his scalpel and begins cutting into your stomach. He pulls

 out chunks of flesh, which fall onto the table below.

&amp;#x200B;

You try to keep yourself calm as the surgeon cuts into your body. It is painful.

Then it stops. Your heart stops beating.

&amp;#x200B;

Your eyes roll up in your head. Your face contorts into a grimace. You don't

 know what happened. You just black out

&amp;#x200B;

You continue to struggle against the pain. The surgeon continues to cut. His

 hands are bloody. Blood drips from his fingers. You can feel it dripping down

 your chest.

&amp;#x200B;

He turns around and looks at you. You see him now. The man who was once so kind

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; ""How is the surgery going, doctor?""

&amp;#x200B;

""It's going well. I'm glad to hear that. Now, how about you? Are you feeling

 any better?""

&amp;#x200B;

You nod slowly.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; ""It hurts, doctor.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Oh yes it does. But I've had worse. What do you want to do?""

""I want to go home"".

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; ""Can I go home now?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Of course you can. Just sit tight for a moment, I'll be right back"".

You wait patiently. A few minutes pass and he returns with a small bag. He opens

 it and takes out a pill. He swallows it and then puts the bag back

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; ""May I have a pill?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Sure thing, but don't eat or drink anything for the next hour or two. And no

 talking. That includes mumbling. Understand?""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; ""Yes, doctor"".

&amp;#x200B;

You stand up and walk over to the door. You look at the clock on the wall. It

 says 10:00 AM. You walk back to the bed where the surgeon stands by.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; ""I'm confused""

&amp;#x200B;

The surgeon shrugs. ""Well, this is your life now. You're going to make the best

 of it"".

&amp;#x200B;

You take a deep breath and begin walking towards the door. The surgeon follows

 you. As you reach the door, you turn around and give him a smile

&amp;#x200B;

You open the door and step outside. You start running away. The surgeon runs

 after you. You run through the streets of the city. You run until you find a

 place to hide. You lie down on the ground and close your eyes. You sleep..

&amp;#x200B;

You awaken in the morning. You see the sun rising. You hear the sound of traffic.

 You get up and look out the window. There is nothing there. You look at the

 time on the wall. It reads 1:30 PM. You sigh and look at the time again

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; ""How did I get home?""

&amp;#x200B;

You look at the clock and realize you slept through the night. You groggily get

 dressed and head downstairs. You knock on the door and enter. You see a woman

 standing in front of you. She has long brown hair and wears a white lab coat

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; ""Hello. Who are you?""

&amp;#x200B;

She smiles and nods. ""My name is Dr. Kessel. How may I help you today?""

You shake her hand. ""Dr. Kessel, I need to go home"".

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; ""I took a pill and fell asleep on the street and woke up here! This isn't my house!""

&amp;#x200B;

She chuckles. ""No, I'm afraid it isn't. You're not supposed to be here. You should

 come with me"".

You think about it. ""What do you mean?""

She walks past you and heads towards the elevator. You follow her

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; ""Where did this elevator come from?""

&amp;#x200B;

She points to an office. ""That's where we work. We test new drugs and procedures

 before they're used anywhere else. In fact, I brought you here because I wanted

 to show you something"".

&amp;#x200B;

You walk into the office

&amp;#x200B;

You vomit all over the floor. You throw up everywhere. You puke on the chair,

 on the walls, on the floor, on the computer screen, on the floor, on the chair,

 on the floor, on the chair, on the floor, on the floor..

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; ""Sorry, everyone""

&amp;#x200B;

You puke on the floor. You puke on the chair, on the chair, on the floor, on

 the floor, on the floor..You puke on the floor

2019-12-11-164706,,What a trip,"You are Dirtman, a peasant living in the kingdom of Larion. You have a pitchfork
 and a nothing else. You wake up and begin working in the fields. You see your
 sister who is also a peasant, she has a child with her husband. She gives birth
 to twins. The children are named Dendrin and Talia
&gt; Cheer on your sister

""I'm proud of you!"" you say. ""We'll be rich! We'll be famous! We'll be heroes!""

Your sister smiles at you. ""Maybe someday,"" she says.

A few days later, you hear a cry for help from far away
&gt; Go check

You run toward the sound of the crying. When you get there, you find that it's
 a little girl. Her name is Lola and she looks like a doll. She's about five
 years old and her eyes are red and puffy. She cries as loud as she can
&gt; Ask what is wrong

""It's just me, honey,"" she says. ""My daddy said he needs to borrow money"".
""Oh... okay.."". you say.
Lola runs off into the woods with a bunch of other children. You follow after
 her
&gt; Lola is part of a child cult

The next day, you come across a group of people who look very much like the ones
 you saw before. They're wearing robes and carrying sticks. They look very serious.
 They all point to you and call out to you.
""What do you want?"" they ask
&gt; Back away slowly

""No, I don't think so"".
""Then why did you come here?"" one asks.
""Because my dad wants me to join this cult"".
""Why would he do such a thing? He has plenty of money"".

&gt; Lola is part of the cult

""That's not true!"", you exclaim. ""He doesn't need money, he has enough"".
One of them grabs your arm. ""Don't lie to us! Tell us the truth or we will kill
 you!""
&gt; Stab cultist

They grab you by both arms and pull you up. One of them holds a knife to your
 throat while another pushes you down onto the ground. The cultists then begin
 chanting something in their language.
&gt; Descend into hell

Suddenly, you feel an intense pain shoot through your body. It feels like someone
 is stabbing you with needles. Your vision goes black and you fall unconscious.

When you wake up, you realize that you're lying on the floor of a large room
&gt; Satan greets me

""Hello, son"", Satan says. ""Do you remember me?""
""Yes, I do"".
""Good, because I've been waiting for you to return home"".
Satan begins to walk towards you. Suddenly, he stops and turns around
&gt; Ask what is happening

""I'm sorry, but I can't let you leave. You're under arrest"".
""But.."".
""I'm sorry, but I must take you to jail"".
&gt; Try to overpower Satan

You struggle against Satan, but he's stronger than you thought. He kicks you
 several times in the stomach and breaks some bones in your face.
""Ah, I see how strong you are now"". Satan laughs
&gt; Anger

""Shut up, Satan!"" you shout.
""Hahaha! Well, well, well, if it isn't the little kid who gets his *** kicked!"".
""Please, please, I didn't do anything"".
""Well, maybe you should start doing something then""
&gt; Fuck you, Satan

You push Satan away and grab him by the collar. ""Let me go, Satan! Let me go!
 I won't tell anyone!""

&gt; Satan sends me back to Earth

You land hard on the ground. You sit up and look around. There's no sign of your
 sister, Lola. You look around and see a small village with a church nearby.
 A man walks out of the church and approaches you. His hair is white and his
 skin is pale
&gt; Be confused

""Are you alright?"", he asks.
""Yeah, I'm fine"".
""Where's your sister?"".
""She went to the forest to play"".
""Okay, well I guess you know where she is"".
""No, I don't""
&gt; Lola is the link

""Well, well, well, if it isn't the little girl who got her  kicked by Satan""
&gt; Lola is a demon

""Hmm, yes, that's right. So you're the one who was kicked by Satan"".
&gt; Fight Lola

You attack Lola with everything you've got. She dodges most of your attacks and
 even counters with some of her own. Eventually, you manage to knock her out.
 You drag her back to the church and throw her inside
&gt; Lock your sister up

You put Lola in a cell and lock the door. You wait patiently for Satan to arrive.
 Finally, he does.
&gt; Satan burns Lola alive

You watch as Satan throws Lola into a fire. As soon as she hits the flames, she
 screams and falls to the ground. Soon, she's dead. You stand over her burning
 corpse.
&gt; Feel empty inside

You suddenly feel empty. You stare at yourself in horror. You're not only feeling
 empty, but also filled with rage. This is your punishment for killing your sister.
 You had to suffer this horrible fate. You feel like. You feel like. You feel
 nothing
&gt; Satan wants to damn my soul for eternity

You feel like you have lost your mind. You feel like you have lost your soul
&gt; Summon powers to defeat Satan

You get up from your bed and rush to Satan. You punch him in the face and run
 out of the house. You run to the forest and jump into the lake. You dive underwater
 and swim to the bottom. You float there until you reach the center of the lake
&gt; Time-space is unstable

You hear a loud noise and turn around. In front of you stands Satan. He looks
 furious. He raises his hands and blasts you with a beam of light. You scream
 and fall backwards into the water. You sink deeper and deeper until you drown

 other. You caress her breasts. You caress her ***. You caress her *****

2019-12-11-185226,,"Anybody want to play AIDungeon with me, but with messages? I just played with someone and below is the result."," 

(He was the player and I was the narrator)

Me:

You stand in a thick green rain forest, with all kinds of creatures darting about you. You are a knight. You carry a steel sword and a wooden shield.

Him:

Determine what kind of creatures are around you

Me:

You look up and see a couple of vibrant green parrots. They squawk and poke their heads about excitedly. You also hear a distant roar somewhere far away.

Him:

Ask the parrots if they can speak your language

Me:

""Of course we understand you! We're not dummies like mankind! What are you doing anyway, standing about like that?""The sun feels hot on your skin. You start to feel thirsty.

Him:

Reply ""I am searching for Ozymandias, King of Kings, whom I have sworn to kill. Do you know where I can find him?""

Me:

""Ozy....what? He is not merely a king of kings, he is a god! You can never hope to defeat him!"" the parrots say in the squawky voices.

""However, if you truly have a death wish, you may venture to Holgard, and face his army.""

The sun is going down. You have been standing for quite a long time. Mosquitoes bite at your face.

Him:

Reply: ""I am thankful for your guidance, however, you have insulted my dignity. For that you shall pay with your lives"" and throw your sword against the two parrots. Then try to fend off the mosquitoes.

Me:

Your sword soars through the air and impales a single parrot against a high branch. The squawking intensifies as the parrots escape, cursing you.

You swat at the mosquitos on your face, you pop their full bodies and allow blood to trickle down your chin. More mosquitos replace them though.

Him:

Pull your sword out of the dead parrot and then venture to Holgard, trying to slash the mosquitoes out of the air as you wander

Me:

You climb up the tree, and with some effort, manage to wrench your sword from the branch. However, you slip and fall 15 feet to the ground. Your ankle cracks.

Him:

Curse loudly at your ankle and try to stand on it

Me:

You try to put weight on your broken ankle, but you soon regret the idea when you hear a loud crack and a surge of pain. You fall to your knees.

To make matters worse, a bear launches itself out of the bushes at you.

Him:

Crawl as fast as you can to a nearby tree and lean your back against it so that you are facing the bear. Then raise you sword and get ready to fend off the bear to the best of your ability

Me:

With extreme effort, you miraculously manage to drag yourself out of the bear's way, to a nearby tree. The bear charges at you, growling furiously. At the last moment, you whip out your sword and prop it against the tree, impaling the bear.

Him:

Try to calm yourself down and retrieve your sword. Then check what happened to your shield during the fight

Me:

You take a few deep breaths to calm yourself. For some reason, you remember that you have a shield strapped to your back. Luckily, you didn't need it to survive the bear attack. However, the last of daylight is disappearing.

Your ankle is bleeding and you are very thirsty.

Him:

Try to limp through forest and search it for something to patch up your ankle with

Me:

Knowing you cannot stay in the dark forest for long, you patch up your ankle with your t shirt and start limping in the general direction of some settlement.

Him:

Desperately look around you for some place where you could settle your thirst, like a lake

Me:

You are terribly thirsty. You limp/crawl in some random directions, but night has fallen, and you have no idea where water or shelter is.

Him:

Cry out for help, realizing that you don't have much time left

Me:

Lost in the darkness, you use the last of your strength to cry out for help.

Him:

Think of your soon-to-be orphan daughter in your last moments

Me:

You try to think of something positive in your final moments, like the way your daughter used to snuggle up against you during bedtime stories.

That's when you hear something. Footsteps? No. A fluttering of wings. Parrots, back to avenge their fallen comrade.

You try to run, but all you can do is nothing. They start tearing at the flesh on your ankle.

2019-12-11-203045,,A hardboiled detective story,"You are Harris, a detective living in Chicago. You have a pistol and a police badge. You enter the forest where you believe the criminal you're searching for fled to. Suddenly, you hear a gunshot coming from behind some trees 
&gt; surrender 

You stop your car and get out of it. The man who shot at you is holding a shotgun. He points his gun at you and says: ""I'm not going to shoot you"". 
&gt; ""Okay."" 

""Do you know why I'm here?"" 

""No"". 

""Well, do you want to tell me?"" 

""Yes"". 

""Then tell me"". 

""Because.."". 
&gt; continue 

""Because you're my friend"". The man looks at you for a long time. Then he nods. He walks over to the truck and opens up the door. He gets in the back seat with the other two men. They drive off 
&gt; watch them leave 

They drive away. You sit down on the curb and wait. You don't hear anything else until they park near the church. A few minutes later, a black SUV pulls up next to the church. Two men get out of the SUV 
&gt; ask men for a ride 

One of the men steps forward. He's about 5'10'' tall and has short brown hair. He wears a white t-shirt that says ""Lucky Dog"" on the front and ""Momma's Boy"" on the back. He holds a small dog by its leash 
&gt; pet dog 

He smiles as he pets the dog. He asks if you'd like to go with him. You nod. He leads you into the church. Inside, there are several people sitting around a table. There are also several doors leading off to various rooms 
&gt; ask if any of them can give you a ride

You look around and see no one willing to help you so you decide to walk to where the men are waiting. You walk through the church towards the tables. Suddenly, you feel something hit your left shoulder. It hurts. You turn around and see the man who hit you earlier standing behind you 
&gt; say dude what the fuck 

He stares at you, confused. He doesn't understand why you would be angry at him. He tries to explain himself but you interrupt him. 
&gt; kick man in dick 

He falls backwards onto the floor. You grab his ankles and pull him up. You then punch him in the dick. He screams out in pain and falls back onto the ground. You laugh and continue punching him in the dick 
&gt; literally rip off his dick

You pull the knife from your pocket and stab the man repeatedly in the . He cries out in agony and begs you to stop. You keep stabbing him in the until blood runs down your arm. You stand up and take a deep breath before walking away 
&gt; apologize to the others in the church

You walk outside and kneel down beside the man who was stabbed. You apologize to him and tell him that you'll make sure he feels better when you get home. He seems relieved. You head back inside and find that the rest of the group has already dispersed 
&gt; go home 

You enter your house and start unpacking. Your mother comes in to check on you. She tells you she knows you were upset and that you should just relax. She goes on to say that you shouldn't worry about it because she knows how much you love her 
&gt; ask mother to read you a story 

She reads you a bedtime story. You fall asleep. 
&gt; dream about justice 

Your father enters your room. He looks very tired. He tells you that you need to wake up early tomorrow morning to go to work. He says that he loves you and will always love you. He kisses you on the forehead and leaves. 
&gt; wonder why i haven't moved out 

You think about your father. You wonder why you haven't moved out yet. You've been working hard all day and you still haven't gotten paid. You wonder if you should move out now or wait until you get paid tomorrow. 
&gt; wait to get paid 

You decide to stay at home today. You eat breakfast and spend most of the afternoon playing video games. At night, you sleep. 
&gt; dream about the case you blew off

You wake up and realize that you forgot to brush your teeth. You call your mom to let her know. She answers and tells you that she'll come pick you up. You thank her and hang up. 
&gt; wait patiently for mother 

You wait patiently for your mother to arrive. Eventually, she arrives. She takes you to school. When you get there, you notice that everyone is staring at you. You try to act normal but you're really nervous. 
&gt; wonder if i should have shaved before coming 

You hesitate for a moment. You could shave your beard off now or... 
&gt; excuse yourself and go shave in school bathroom 

You hurry to the bathroom and shave your face. After shaving, you run back to class. Everyone notices your new appearance. Some of them stare at you suspiciously. Others tell you to go home and change your clothes. Finally, some of your classmates tease you 
&gt; cry 

You cry quietly in the bathroom stall. You hide under the stalls while your friends taunt you. One of them finally calls the cops. 
&gt; ask your cop coworkers to arrest these awful children 

You rush to the restroom and lock the door. You call the cops. The officers arrive quickly arrest the kids. You're taken into custody. You're charged with attempted murder and sentenced to death. 
&gt; call lawyer 

You call your lawyer. He tells you that he'll represent you in court. He tells you that he'll do everything he can to get you life without parole. He promises to fight for you. 
&gt; prepare for trial 

You gather your belongings and pack your bags. You begin preparing for trial. You wait nervously. You listen to the judge's decision. He sentences you to death.

&amp;#x200B;

* ***see what happens next***  is a good neutral prompt to force the story to progress on it's own. Nice when the response you get doesn't feel complete. ***Continue*** or similar also works. Just pressing Enter with a blank text block also works, but can cause crashes.
* ***listen*** can be useful if the AI stops just before writing dialogue
* ***attempt to \[action\]*** adds a chance to fail at doing something
* ***give \[item\] to \[person\]*** injects said item into the story. you can also force a character to give you an item or type ""***you found a \[item\]***""
* ***summon a \[person, object, creature\]***
* ***do something random*** or similar commands are handy if you can't think of what to do next.
* ***describe \[character\]'s appearance*** reliably creates a physical description.

&amp;#x200B;

You climb up the stairs and find yourself in the church. There is a large statue
 of a man standing before you. He looks like a cross between a priest and a pope.
 His robes are black and his beard is white. He wears a golden ring on his right
 index finger
&gt; Destroy the large statue while screaming about evil in the Bible

You rush forward and swing your sword at the statue. It doesn't even slow down
 your attack as you cut through its chest. The statue crumbles to dust and you
 feel a sense of satisfaction. However, there is still one more thing you need
 to do
&gt; Shout for Pope Francis to come out of his hiding

You run forward and shout for Pope Francis who is nowhere to be found. Suddenly,
 you feel a burning pain in your heart. You look behind you and see a small hole
 in your chest. You gasp in agony and collapse to the ground
&gt; Examine wound

You carefully examine the wound and notice that it isn't fatal. You quickly recover
 and continue your journey. Soon, you arrive at the town of Stalag Luft III where
 you meet with the other rebels. They tell you that they have managed to escape
 the clutches of the Empire
&gt; Tell rebels that they can call themselves ""The Atheists""

You inform them that they should change their name to ""The Atheists"", since they
 believe that God does not exist. The rebels cheer and agree with you
&gt; Tell rebels to storm the Pope's house - Vatican

You tell the rebels that they should storm the Pope's house and kill him. They
 all agree and set off towards the Pope's home.
&gt; You arrive at Pope's home. You and rebels yell for the Pope to come

You arrive at the Pope's home and you and the rebels yell for the Pope to come.
 You all open fire upon the Pope's house. Unfortunately, the Pope is too fast
 and dodges most of your shots
&gt; Tell Pope to settle this as a man. Tell Pope that you want to debate on whether the god exists or not.

You tell Pope that you want to debate on whether the god exists or not. Pope
 agrees and tells you that you can have a few minutes to make your case.
&gt; Tell Pope that god doesn't exist because if he did, he would strike you down as we speak.

You tell Pope that god doesn't exist because if he did, he would strike you down
 as you speak. Pope nods and says that you have made an excellent point. You
 thank him and leave the Pope's house.
&gt; Scream that God is dead and we killed him

You scream loudly that God is dead and you killed him. Everyone in the town hears
 your screams and runs outside to see what happened. Some of them try to help
 you but you are already dead
&gt; Go to heaven

You go to heaven and you see a beautiful woman dressed in red. She smiles at
 you and asks you if you are ready to begin your eternal life. You nod and say
 yes. She takes you to a room and begins to prepare you for your new life.

You have managed to survive several months avoiding zombies and scavenging food. You cautiously enter a rundown store and hear the sounds of a conversation going on inside.


&gt; You eavesdrop on the conversation.


You sneak around behind the counter and listen in on what is being said.

""What's this?""

""A new flavor of ice cream"".

""Ice cream? What kind?""



&gt; You keep listening.


The owner comes out from his office and sees you. He looks at you suspiciously as he speaks.
""Who are you?"", he asks.
""I'm just some guy that came here looking for something"", you reply.


&gt; You demand ice cream.


""No! I want ice cream!"", you shout.
The owner backs away slowly. ""Alright then, I'll give you ice cream""., he says.
He walks over to the freezer and opens it up. Inside is an ice cream scoop

&gt; You demand three scoops.


""Three scoops?! That's not enough!""

&gt; You agree.


You walk back over to the counter and sit down. The owner takes your order.

&gt; You demand five scoops instead.


""Five scoops?!"" the owner exclaims.
""Yeah, but I want more than one scoop"".

&gt; You hurry him up.


The owner gets up from his chair and rushes over to the freezer. He opens it up and grabs two scoops. He puts them into the freezer and then returns to the table.

&gt; You look at him in disbelief then demand three more scoops.


""You're joking right? Three more scoops?!""

&gt; You grumpily accept the two scoops.


You reluctantly take the two scoops.

&gt; You angrily eat ice cream.


You quickly chew on the ice cream and feel sick. You vomit all over yourself and throw up again.

&gt; You scream at the owner because he poisoned you.


You scream at the owner who doesn't even turn around.

&gt; You draw your gun and demand an antidote.


You grab your gun and run over to the owner.

&gt; You threaten the owner.


You pull out your gun and point it at the owner.

&gt; You demand antidote.


The owner turns around and points his finger at you.

&gt; You demand antidote one last time.


The owner pulls out a syringe and injects himself with the antidote.

You have a steel longsword and a wooden shield. You are on a quest to defeat the evil dragon of Larion. You've heard he lives up at the north of the kingdom. You set on the path to defeat him and walk into a dark forest. As you enter the forest you see a huge black dragon flying over the trees. He looks so angry that his wings seem almost broken.

""What is it?"" you ask.

""I'm here to kill you""
&gt; You say ""Not if I kill you first!""

The dragon roars and lets out a burst of flame from his mouth. The flames engulf your sword and shield, but fortunately they don't touch you. The dragon turns around and flies away.
&gt; You look where the dragon is flying to.

You follow the dragon's flight path and find yourself in the middle of a small village. A few houses stand there, but most people are running for their lives. You hear screams and wails as people run out of their homes and try to escape the dragon's fire
&gt; You sneak near the dragon.

You quickly hide behind a house and wait until the dragon has left the village. Then you slip out of the house and get close enough to the dragon that he will not notice you.
&gt; You stab the dragon in the back.

You stab the dragon in the back with your sword. He doesn't even flinch, but he does turn his head slightly to stare at you. You grab him by the neck and throw him into a nearby wall.

&gt; You go on a heroic quest to find your lost mother!

You decide that you need to get out of this place as soon as possible. You start looking for your mother, but you don't succeed. You look all over the countryside, but no one ever finds her

&gt; You go to your village and ask everyone what they know.

You walk around the village asking everyone if anyone has seen your mother. Nobody knows where she is. You go back to your house and tell your father about your search. He tells you to come with him to his wife's grave.

&gt; You follow your father.

Your father leads you to the grave and says: ""This is my wife's grave. I want you to bury her here"". You feel sad at first, but then you remember how much you love your parents and you smile

&gt; You ask father where he thinks she died.

""I think she was killed by bandits"". Your father replies.

&gt; You go trade your pitchfork for a sword.

You agree to go with your father to the bandit camp. When you arrive, you see several men armed with swords. They tell you to kneel down and take off your shirt. You do so and they begin to beat you

&gt; You fight back!

You stand up and attack them. The men are very strong and you manage to knock some of them down. You continue fighting until you hear screams from outside. One of the men notices your mother is missing.

&gt; You demand the man explain!

The man explains that they were searching for someone called 'Terrance' who had been missing since yesterday. Terrance was supposed to meet you there, but he never showed up. They say that he might be dead or captured by the bandits

&gt; Say ""I am Terrance!"".

You shout ""I am Terrance!"" and run towards your mother's grave. You run through the graveyard and into the woods. You stop when you reach the edge of the forest. You cry out ""Mother!"" and fall to your knees. A voice cries out

&gt; You gasp, ""Mother?!"".

You scream ""Mother?!"" and look up at the sky. You see a woman dressed in white standing above you. She smiles at you and whispers ""It's done now"". You turn to leave, but she grabs your hand and pulls you back

&gt; You are overcome by the woman!

You turn to face the woman and hug her tightly. She holds you tight and kisses you before walking away. You look at her and nod. You are left alone

&gt; You wonder who the woman in white was.

You are filled with confusion and wonder who the woman in white was. You look at your hands and realize they are covered in blood. You try to wipe it off, but it doesn't work. You look at your feet and notice that your shoes are also bloody

&gt; You bandage your wounds.

You put your arms in bandages and begin to rub your bleeding feet. Suddenly, you hear a voice call out to you. It sounds like a young girl's voice. You look up and see a beautiful woman holding a pitchfork in her hand

&gt; You gasp, ""Is that you, mother?!"".

You yell ""Yes, it's me, mother!"" and kiss her. You then look at your mother and embrace her as well. The two women embrace each other and weep together. Then, they both laugh and dance together

&gt; You murder mother and take her corpse to the grave father showed you.

You kill your mother and take her body to your father's grave. Father shows you how to properly bury your mother. You do not learn anything new though

&gt; You pat yourself on the back for a job well done.  Quest complete!

You return home and tell your mother what happened. She is pleased that you did well and hugs you

&gt; You stop wondering You see your.

You suddenly become aware of your surroundings. You are lying on a bed of flowers. There is a small table next to you with a knife and fork on it. You look at the knife and realize that you just stabbed yourself in the heart. You die instantly
YOU DIED. GAME OVER

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You realize it's a female dragon. Say ""I'm sorry, please take this treasure as an apology."".

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You look down at your sword and shield and say ""I'm sorry, I can't let you take my treasure. Please, I beg you, take this treasure from me!"" The dragon flies away and you turn back to face the dragon who now has turned his attention towards you

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You give the dragon a magic ring that turns her into a human.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The dragon looks at you with anger and says ""This isn't fair! I was born like this! I don't want to be anything else!"" She takes off her armor and reveals herself to be a young girl

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You open the tree trunk.

&amp;#x200B;

You pull out a stone key and insert it into the lock. You hear a click and then nothing happens. You sigh and say ""Well, there goes all hope of getting home""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You bash open the tree trunk.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You begin to smash the tree trunk apart. As you do so, you feel something grab your hand. You turn around and see a small, frail creature. He has a tiny head and a thin body. His eyes are wide and frightened

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You say ""Go home Dobby. I don't have any socks."".

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

He nods and runs off. You sit down on the ground and think about what happened

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You say ""When did I enter the Potterverse?"".

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You look up and see a house. A huge house. Huge enough for you to live in, but not big enough for a house full of people. You walk inside and find yourself in a kitchen. You see a man cooking food. He is dressed in a chef's outfit

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You say ""Chef Boyardee? Is that you?"".

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

He nods and says ""Yeah, it's me Chef Boyardee. What're you doing here?""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Say ""I'm a wandering knight, looking for female dragons to woo. I found your house after getting lost."".

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You say ""Uh no thanks. I'm only interested in female dragons."".

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

He chuckles and says ""Oh, well I guess you won't be able to resist me then. Come on, let's go"".

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You run away from Chef Boyardee.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You run out of the kitchen and hide behind a nearby cabinet. You wait patiently for him to leave and then suddenly he comes back in. He sits down next to you and asks 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You listen.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You nod and say ""Sure. Just one question though. Why are you here?""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Say ""I just want to make love to a dragon woman."".

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

He smiles and says ""Hmm, sounds like you've got quite the appetite. So, how much do you want for \*\*\*?""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You scream ""No!"" and run away desperately.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

He laughs and says ""Hah! You sure got a funny sense of humor. Here, let me give you a little present. Come on, let's go eat"".

You follow Chef Boyardee outside where he begins to chase you

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Say ""I'm sorry Chef Boyardee, but you've forced me to do this."" and you slash the Chef with your sword.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You watch as the Chef falls backwards and then gets up again. He stands up and shouts ""That was fun right? Now, let's go eat some more!"".

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You channel holy energy into sword and smite Chef Boyardee.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You quickly charge your sword and swing it at the Chef. The blade slices through the air and hits the Chef in the chest. The Chef screams and collapses to the floor. You stand over him and smile at the pain.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Say ""I'm sorry."" and put the Chef out of his misery.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You turn and walk away. You start to hear a noise and turn to see Chef Boyardee standing there. He sees you and yells ""What the \*\*\*\* are you doing?! You killed my master! You \*\*\*\*\*\*\*!""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You behead the second Chef Boyardee.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You raise your sword and cut the Chef in half. He cries out and tries to crawl away, but you stop him by slamming your foot against his throat. He struggles and begs for mercy, but you slam him into the wall and kick him in the face

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Say ""I'm sick and tired of all these Chefs! Leave me alone!"".

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You walk past Chef Boyardee and back to your room. You close the door and lay down on your bed. You fall asleep..

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You wake up.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You awake in your room. You are lying on your bed. You notice you are naked. You look down and see a small, skinny creature sitting on your bed. He has a strange looking hat on his head and wears a robe. He is eating your lego meal

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You say ""Dammit Dobby! Did you strip me and start eating my legos?"".

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

""In which""If you answer..

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You say ""Dobby, stop eating my legos and give me back my clothes!"".

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;A few minutes later...

\&gt;The next day after that you leave Dobby returns&gt;The next morning you leav

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You put clothes back on.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You try to leave Dobby stops you and tells you to stay and eats your legos. You cry and ask him to leave. He agrees and leaves. You decide to go back.

\&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You prepare poisonous knives.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You return to the kitchen and see Chef Boyardee waiting for you. He looks very hungry. He says ""Hey, you lookin' re hungry too. Let me help ya cook up some food for ya"".

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You scream in horror.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You attack Chef Boyardee.

You slice Chef Boyardee across the face. He screams and falls to the floor. You laugh and say ""Well, looks like I knew yer a pretty good fighter, now, huh?""

\&gt; You run to town.

&amp;#x200B;

You run to town and tell everyone what happened. They believe you. They arrest Chef Boyardee and throw him in jail. You run back to the kitchen and continue cooking up the food. You finish cooking up you take the last of the legos

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You give poison legos to Dobby.

2019-12-12-034711,,Harry does the Dark Ritual,"You are Harry Potter. You head towards the Herbology classroom. When you arrive, you see that everyone has already arrived. You see Draco sitting at one of the desks, reading a book. You also see Crabbe and Goyle standing nearby, talking quietly amongst themselves. You haven't seen them since yesterday morning

&gt; You talk to Draco.

Draco looks up as you approach. ""Hello, Harry"".

&gt; You aks him what book he is reading.

""I'm reading A History of Magic, by Miranda Vickers"".

&gt; You ask him if it's interesting.

""Interesting. Interesting indeed"".

&gt; You ask him if you can borrow it.

""Sure, sure, whatever. Just come over here"".
You walk over to Draco who takes his book from his desk and hands it to you. You read through it quickly, before handing it back to him.

&gt; You take the book back and read it all.

You grab the book back from Draco and read through it once more. This time, you find that you have found something new. Something very important. It seems that this book contains information on a powerful Dark Ritual.
You turn to Draco and whisper 

&gt; You ask him what he knows about the Dark Ritual.

""I know nothing, Harry. I only know that it involves a lot of blood and pain"".

&gt; You ask him to do it together this night.

""What?! But... but.."".

&gt; You tell him that the Dark Ritual will make you more powerful.

""But Harry, it's just blood and pain! What good does that do me? If I get stronger, then who's gonna stop me?"".

&gt; You you say nobody.

""Then who's gonna stop me?""

&gt; You you say you.

""I said nobody, Harry. Nobody!"".

&gt; You stab him with your wand and do the ritual right now.

""No, no, no, no.."".

&gt; You stab his eye.

You quickly rush forward and stab your wand straight into Draco's left eye. He screams out in pain, before falling backwards onto the ground. You stand up slowly, staring at Draco's eyes. The blood trickles down his face as he struggles to breathe

&gt; You look around you.

You turn around and stare at the students surrounding you. They are all watching you intently. You feel like you should be scared, but instead you feel sick. You feel like you've done something terrible, but you're not sure why. You decide to leave.

&gt; You use the blood of Draco to do the dark ritual.

You quickly run out of the school, leaving a trail of blood behind you. As soon as you exit the gates, you immediately start running. You don't even bother stopping to catch your breath. You simply continue running until you reach the outskirts of Hogsmeade

&gt; You find some drugs.

You quickly run across the road, where you stumble upon a drug store. You buy a bag of cocaine and enter the shop. Inside, you buy a large amount of pills and capsules. You put them into a satchel and leave the store

&gt; You give the drugs to an homeless man.

You quickly run to the nearest homeless person and hand him the drugs. He stares at you with disbelief, before taking the drugs and swallowing them whole. He collapses onto the ground, convulsing violently. He begins to bleed profusely from his mouth and nose, before finally dying

&gt; You do the ritual using the body on the ground.

You quickly run to the nearest body on the street and kneel beside it. You carefully place the body on the ground, so that it doesn't move or twitch. You then cast a spell over it, which causes it to act as though it were dead

&gt; You try to do the ritual.

You quickly cast a spell over the body, causing it to act as though it were dead. You then cast another spell over the body, making it appear to be completely lifeless. You then cast a third spell, causing the corpse to begin moving again.

&gt; You continue practicing this spell.

You continue casting spells over the corpse, trying to perfect the process. Eventually, you succeed in making the corpse move again. You continue to practice this spell over the corpse, until eventually, you manage to make the corpse move and speak.

&gt; You become the master of life and death.

You raise the corpse up to your level, and you become the master of life and death. You command the corpse to obey you. It obeys you without question. You command it to feed on human flesh, and it feeds on humans without hesitation

&gt; You give order to the corpse to kill everybody in Hogsmeade.

You raise the corpse up to your level, and you command the corpse to attack everyone in Hogsmeade. It attacks anyone who gets in its way. Soon, the entire town is under attack

&gt; You use blood magic on the citizens of Hogsmeade.

You raise the corpse up to your level, and you command the corpse to drain their blood. You force the citizens of Hogsmeade to drink the blood of others, until they die. Soon, the town becomes a graveyard

&gt; You resurrect everybody as a zombie.

You raise the corpse up to your level, and you command the corpse to rise up the citizens of Hogsmeade as zombies. Soon, the town becomes a giant graveyard

&gt; You attack Hogwarts.

You raise the corpse up to your level, and you command the corpse to attack Hogwarts. You send the corpses of the dead attacking the castle flying towards the school. You watch as the bodies slam into the doors, smashing them open, and killing many students inside

&gt; You laugh maniacally.

You raise the corpse up to your level, and you command the corpse to laugh maniacally. You command the corpse to charge headlong towards the castle, tearing it apart and destroying it completely

&gt; You find Dumbledore.

You raise the corpse up to your level, and you command the corpse to find Dumbledore. You command the corpse to search everywhere for the old wizard, before finding him in his study. You see Dumbledore sitting there, reading a book

&gt; You ask Dumbledore the name of the book.

You raise the corpse up to your level, and you command the corpse to ask Dumbledore the name of the book. You command the corpse to point at the book, and then to shout 

&gt; You challenge Dumbledore to a magic duel.

You raise the corpse up to your level, and you command the corpse to confront Dumbledore. You command the corpse to attack Dumbledore, while you fire a burst of flame at him, burning him and knocking him back

&gt; You use Avada Kedavra.

You raise the corpse up to your level, and you command the corpse to use Avada Kedavra on Dumbledore. You curse Dumbledore, who attempts to block the spell, but fails miserably

&gt; You make Dumbledore explode.

""Yeah, it's pretty cool,"" Mel says
&gt; leave and head out to catch more pokemon

You decide that you need to get out of here as soon as possible so you go back
 home and tell your parents what happened. They don't seem too surprised by all
 this and just say they'll be sending you to a different school for the rest
 of the year
&gt; leave town

You pack some clothes in your bag and take them with you when you leave. When
 you get to the bus stop, you see a bunch of people there already. You quickly
 hop on the next one over. The driver looks at you and waves you on
&gt; look for pokemon

You walk around looking for any pokemon that might be nearby but unfortunately
 you can't find anything. It's not like it was a good day to look for pokemon
 anyway.
&gt; check in the red light district

You go into the red light district which is actually pretty busy right now. There
 are a few prostitutes sitting outside and inside a couple of brothels. Most
 of them look like normal humans except for their eyes which have been gouged
 out or burned out. Some even look like zombies

 a word though. She just stares at you and then turns her attention away from
 you. You try to make small talk but she just ignores you completely

 he knows several trainers who live there and has a lot of experience training
 pokemon.

2019-12-12-050511,,Collecting some tips and tricks,"I feel like the AI is kinda dumb and needs specific phrases to keep the flow so for my and others better experience i kinda wanna write down some tips for better experience. Heres some that I found browsing this subreddit:

Talk in 2nd person. (I.e: ""You are doing this."" Rather than ""I am doing this."".). I dont know why but I heard it's recommended. I think it improves writing quality since the bot refers to you as ""you"" already.

Always remind the bot previous features if necessary because the bot forgets everything after 10 prompts.

If stuck on a repetitive convo or loop, write leave in the prompt.

If there is no way to get out of the loop, say in lowercase, restart. Restart seems to be a hidden command atm.

The bot will not make the story itself. You might have to force characters in or force character actions and speech as it might derive from the story or randomly stop using the characters.

If you want, open up a notepad and take notes of what items you have. But might be useless because stories are short.

Don't be afraid to write your sexual fantasies. They work wonders and i dont think the dev would care. But if you feel uncomfortable, put down nosave as a promt and t wont save your prompt. (Pro tip: regardless, be on the safe side and don't live the really bad ones. Not safe for life. You know.)

Use ""you're/they're/he's/she's/it's/in actually \_\_\_\_"" or anything similar. The bot tends to assume your appearance or change it and sometimes your name because of the 10 prompt forget thing.

2019-12-12-064513,,What is Yugioh?," 

**You are Yugi Moto, a wizard living in the kingdom of Larion. You have a staff**

**and a spellbook. You finish your long journey and finally arrive at the ruin**

**you've been looking for. You look around and see that it's not much more than**

**a pile of rubble.**

**&gt; Summon Dark Magician to help me search the ruin**

**Dark Magician is a powerful being, but he's also very old. He has lived for centuries**

**and his magic is very strong.**

**&gt; What is Yu-Gi-Oh?**

**Yu-Gi-Oh! is a card game that was created by Téa Gardner. It is played on a playing**

**field made up of cards which are placed face down on the table**

**&gt; How do I play Yu-Gi-Oh!?**

**Players take turns drawing cards from a deck until they run out of cards or their**

**opponent does so. Players can attack each other's life points using the cards**

**in their hands, but if one player attacks another player's life points too much,**

**then both players lose the game**

**&gt; What Yu-Gi-Oh! cards are there?**

**There are many different types of cards that can be used in Yu-Gi-Oh**

**&gt; Is Dark Magician a Yu-Gi-Oh! card?**

**No, Dark Magician is not a Yu-Gi-Oh! Card. He is just a normal magician who happens**

**to have magical powers.**

**&gt; Is Blue-Eyes White Dragon a Yu-Gi-Oh! card?**

**Yes, Blue-Eyes White Dragon is a Yu-Gi-Oh! Card. However, Dark Magician is a**

**wizard who uses the power of darkness to fight against the forces of good.**

**&gt; Play Yu-Gi-Oh!**

**Blue-Eyes White Dragon attacks Dark Magician, but Dark Magician manages to dodge**

**all of the Blue-Eyes White Dragon's attacks. Dark Magician then summons two**

**Black Lizards to attack Blue-Eyes White Dragon**

**&gt; Summon Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon to attack Dark Magician**

**Your Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon attacks Dark Magician, but Dark Magician dodges**

**the attack. Dark Magician then summons a giant monster called the ""Black Skull**

**Dragon"" to battle your Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon.**

**&gt; Activate Burst Stream of Destruction to destroy Dark Magician**

**You use your Burst Stream of Destruction to destroy Dark Magician. Your victory**

**celebration is cut short when you feel a burning sensation in your chest**

&amp;#x200B;

So the most interesting and notable thing, is how the rules of yugioh were defined. When asked how to play yugioh, the ai responded ""...**Players can attack each other's life points using the cards**

**in their hands, but if one player attacks another player's life points too much,**

2019-12-12-163717,,Thanos did a bad,"You are Thanos, a squire living in the kingdom of Larion. You have a spear and

 a pack of supplies. You follow Sir Theo as he enters the forest, he turns to

 you and says ""I am going to kill the beast""

\&gt; Snap my fingers

&amp;#x200B;

You take a deep breath and snap your fingers. The ground begins to shake violently.

 The trees begin to fall from their branches. Theo screams out in terror. You

 turn around and see that the forest has been completely destroyed. Trees lie

 broken and dead. Theo is screaming at you

\&gt; Snap more

&amp;#x200B;

You continue snapping your fingers until you hear a voice cry out ""No! No!""

\&gt; Snap at theo

&amp;#x200B;

Theo runs towards you with his hands up. He cries out ""I didn't do anything!""

\&gt; SNAP

&amp;#x200B;

You grab Theo by the collar and slam him into the ground. You pull out your sword

 and slice Theo's throat open. Blood pours down Theo's face as he dies. You then

 stab yourself in the chest repeatedly

\&gt; Snap myself

&amp;#x200B;

You stand back up and look at the destruction. You feel like you should be able

 to do something about this, but you can't seem to focus on anything except your

 own survival

\&gt; Snap theo's corpese

&amp;#x200B;

You stand back up and look at the destruction. You feel like you should be able

 to do something about this, but you can't seem to focus on anything except your

 own survival

\&gt; Snap theo's Body

&amp;#x200B;

You walk over to Theo's body and you grab hold of his head. You twist it and

 break it. You throw Theo's body away and run off into the woods. You don't know

 where you're going or what you'll find, but you just want to get away from here

\&gt; Snap my fingers Intensely

&amp;#x200B;

You suddenly feel extremely tired. You slowly sit up and notice that you've snapped

 several times. You try to concentrate on getting better, but you're not really

 making much progress. You lay down and go to sleep

\&gt; in your dreams you find giant fingers

&amp;#x200B;

In your dream, you find giant fingers coming out of the ground. They reach all

 the way up to the sky. Then they start grabbing people one by one. Everyone

 is screaming and running for their lives.

\&gt; the fingers start snaping

&amp;#x200B;

Suddenly, the fingers grab you. You scream and struggle, but they keep coming.

 Eventually, you manage to escape, but you lose a lot of blood.

\&gt; you wake up

&amp;#x200B;

You wake up feeling very weak. You groggily sit up and realize that you haven't

 had any food since yesterday. You also remember waking up with a splitting headache

 last night. You quickly check your surroundings and see that you're in a large

 field

\&gt; get food from backpack

&amp;#x200B;

You grab your backpack and see that there's no food inside. You think about how

 you could easily catch some wild game, but you'd rather stay safe than eat something

 poisonous.

\&gt; eat deathcap mushroom

&amp;#x200B;

You put the death cap mushroom in your mouth and chew on it. It tastes horrible,

 but it gives you energy. You decide to make a fire and warm up. You set the

 ground ablaze and sit near it. Suddenly, you feel very sick

\&gt; Stare into the fire

&amp;#x200B;

You stare into the flames and watch them dance around you. Your eyes burn and

 water up. You feel like you might pass out soon, but you don't give up hope.

\&gt; the flames wisper to you

&amp;#x200B;

You watch the flames wiggle and whisper to you. You look at the flames and wonder

 if they will ever stop dancing around you.

\&gt; the flames teleport you to the underwolrd

&amp;#x200B;

You suddenly feel very sleepy. You lie down and close your eyes. Suddenly, you

 feel very light. You look around and see that you're floating in midair. You

 look around and see that you're in a room made of stone. There's a door in the

 wall behind you

\&gt; examine the walls

&amp;#x200B;

You inspect the walls and see that they're covered with runes. Some of them are

 simple, while others are complex. You study the runes for a few minutes before

 you realize that you need to get out of here. You look around and realize that

 you're surrounded by mountains

\&gt; put all your energy into one big snap

&amp;#x200B;

You jump up and down and shout ""YESSSS!"". You immediately unleash a powerful

 burst of energy that causes everything within a five mile radius to explode.

 Everything within that area explodes in a bright flash and a loud noise.

\&gt; you get dimension warped

&amp;#x200B;

You float through the air and land in front of a small house. You look around

 and see that it looks like it was built in the middle ages. You feel like you're

 in a fairy tale. A beautiful woman appears before you and asks you a question.

\&gt; ""Who are you?""

&amp;#x200B;

 She says ""My name is Marik"" and walks over to you. She touches your shoulder

 and smiles at you. You smile back and she says ""Well, I'm glad you're here"".

 You nod and ask her another question. ""What's your name?"" She says ""Marik""

\&gt; Snap you fingers in her mouth

&amp;#x200B;

You snap your fingers in her mouth and she turns around. She stares at you and

 then starts laughing. She grabs you by the shirt and kisses you passionately.

 You moan loudly and gasp for air. You feel very happy and relaxed afterwards

\&gt; master the art of finger snaping

&amp;#x200B;

You learn to master the art of finger snapping. You practice it every day and

 you become faster and stronger. Soon, you're able to snap your fingers so fast

 that you can kill someone instantly. You can even kill someone without touching

 them

\&gt; look for bandits to test you fingers

&amp;#x200B;

You begin to travel through the forest. You spot a group of bandits trying to

 rob a caravan. The leader of the bandits yells at you and points at you. You

 snap your fingers and shoot two arrows directly at the bandits

\&gt; you kill the leader

&amp;#x200B;

You snap your arrow hits the leader in the neck and chest killing him instantly.

 He falls backwards and drops his bow. You turn around and point at the rest

 of the bandits who are still alive and yell at you

\&gt; ""your mom gay""

&amp;#x200B;

The fuckers. Now we gonna kill 'Kill the rest. Kill the rest. We're gonna kill

 the fuck you.

 see a woman with long blond hair walking towards you. Her eyes are green and

 her face is beautiful

 call her a ""Beautiful whore"" and laugh even harder. She looks up and smiles.

 She calls you a ""Loser"" and walks away

\&gt; cry

&amp;#x200B;

You cry for what seems like hours. You think about how you never wanted to hurt

 anyone ever since you were little. You thought you'd die when you were very

 young. But now? Now you feel happy. You feel free. You feel powerful. You feel

 alive

\&gt; CHARGE POWER

You are Pat, a scientist  trying to survive in a world filled with infected zombies everywhere. You have a backpack and a solar powered tablet. You pound your fist on the table angry that you still haven't found the cure to the infection. You turn to your assistant and say 

&gt; You say ""Damn. Zombies are just the worst, huh?"".


""****. Zombies are just the worst, huh?""

The zombie looks at you as if it wants to attack but then decides against it. It turns away from you and walks over to the door of the lab. It opens it up and steps out. The other two follow after it

&gt; Say ""I mean, they're annoying but they don't hurt people."".


""I mean, they're annoying but they don't hurt people"".

&gt; You continue.


""Yeah, I guess that's true"".

&gt; You say ""They smell really bad though. That's why we need to find a cure, Kyle."".


""We? We don't know anything about curing them do we?""

&gt; You say ""We know that setting them on fire does NOT work, and that's a start, right?"".


""Right!""

&gt; You say ""So the next step, I guess, is to set them on fire and then try toasting marshmallows. See what happens then."".


""That sounds like a good idea too! Let's get started!"".

You and the two others head back into the woods and begin heading towards the house. As you walk, you notice that there are several dead bodies lying around. You also see some human flesh scattered all over the ground

&gt; You grab the marshmallows.


""Hey! These aren't marshmallows! They're human brains!""

&gt; You say ""Darn it, Kyle. I double checked the shopping list and everything this time! This is your fault."".


""It isn't my fault! Look, I'll give you another chance, but if you come back here again without me, I'm going to kill you!""

&gt; You say ""Kyle, I know the last week has been stressful, but we have to assign blame."".


""Fine, fine, I'll go.."".

&gt; Say ""It's alright. You're clearly not competent. I will buy marshmallows."".


""Thanks for buying me marshmallows!""

&gt; You go buy marshmallows.


You grab a few bags of marshmallows and take them back to the house. When you return, you realize that you've forgotten something. You look down and see that you've left the bag of marshmallows in the car

&gt; You go get the marshmallows from the car.


You run back to the car and grab the bag of marshmallows. When you return, you realize that you've forgotten something

&gt; You go to the lab and begin the marshmallow experiment.


You open the door to the lab and see a bunch of supplies laid out. You pick up a small vial of green liquid and pour it into a large bowl of marshmallows. You put the bowl inside a cooler and close the lid. You then turn off the lights and wait

&gt; You wait for results.


After waiting for an hour or so, you hear a loud noise coming from outside. You quickly open the door and peek out through the window. You can see a group of people running out of the house. One of them is holding a shotgun

&gt; You say ""Kyle? Is that you?"".


""Yes, it is, it's just... I.."".

&gt; You say ""Well, the marshmallow experiment was a dud, but we have extras and we have a microwave so it's not a total loss."".


""Okay, okay, whatever. Just hurry up and lock the door, because I think these people saw us coming out"".

&gt; You say ""Yeah, but they're friendly."".


""Hmmm, well that's good, but I think they're looking for someone else now"".

&gt; You say ""That's not our problem, though."".


""What? What do you mean?""

&gt; You say ""Kyle, if they're not looking for us, we don't have to care."".


""But.."".

&gt; Say ""I'm sure it will be fine. And if not, then we will have marshmallows."".


""Wait, what?""

&gt; Say ""I bought entirely too many marshmallows."".


""Oh no, you didn't. You bought enough to make a batch of extra marshmallows"".

&gt; You eat marshmallows.


You eat as much marshmallows as you want. The three of you sit around eating the food while watching TV. Eventually, you decide to go to sleep. You lay down on the couch and fall asleep.

The next day, you wake up to a knock on the door

&gt; You open the door.


You open the door and see a man dressed in black standing in front of you. He looks very serious.

&gt; You say ""How can I help you?"".


""I am Doctor Kessel, and I am here to offer you a deal"".

&gt; Say ""I'm listening."".


""If you agree to join me, I will tell you where the nearest hospital is, and how to get there by bus. If you refuse, I will call the police and they will escort you away"".

&gt; Say ""If I offer you marshmallows, will you go away?"".


""Of course, I won't resist"".

&gt; You offer the man marshmallows.


""Alright, here you go"".

&gt; You say ""Nice doing business. Goodbye."".


He leaves and you slowly get up from the couch. You walk over to the fridge and grab some milk. You drink half of it and start drinking the rest of it. It tastes really bad, but you feel like you need to keep yourself hydrated

&gt; You go back to the lab.


You head back to the lab and find Kyle sitting at his desk. He looks up when he sees you and gives you a smile

&gt; You perform science montage.


You perform a science montage of your life, showing various events in the past and present. You also show clips of other people you know who are currently alive. Finally, you show clips of the people you know who are dead.

&gt; You find a cure for the zombie infection.


You finish the montage and then ask Kyle ""So, what did you learn?""

&gt; You continue.


""I learned that you're a nice guy, and you're smart. But I also learned that you're a bit of a liar, which makes you even more dangerous"".

&gt; You say ""Right. But we need to start curing people."".


""No, we need to start killing people. We should be focusing on getting rid of the living first, before we worry about the dead"".

&gt; You say ""Kyle, that is a terrible plan."".


""It is, but I've been thinking about this. I mean, I could convince you to join me, but I doubt if you'd accept such a thing. So, I'll try something different. I'm going to kill you""

&gt; You say ""Well. That sucks. Can I convince you not to do that?"".


""Sure, why not. Let's play a game, shall we?""

&gt; You win the game.


You win the game, and Kyle says ""Good job! Now let's get to work!""

&gt; You use the zombie cure to save the world.


You use the zombie cure to save the world. You give all your money to Dr. Kessel, so he can build a better vaccine. You also donate your brain to him so he can create a new virus that will wipe out the undead.

2019-12-12-182147,,From a failed assassin to a succesful porn baron,"
**Prompt:** Your name is Silk Knife. You are the official assassin for the Empire. When enemies of the state need to be killed, the Empress asks you for help. You are highly trained in martial arts and knowledgeable of poisons. Today the Empress has summoned you

 to her chambers

&gt; bow before the Empress and wait for instructions.

You stand at attention as the Empress approaches you. She looks down upon you with a slight frown on her face. ""I am sorry my child, but I must ask that you not kill this man"". The Empress says.

&gt; protest, it is my job to kill.

""It is my duty to serve the Emperor!"" You shout back.

The Empress sighs deeply. ""Very well then, but you will have to do better than this"".

She turns away from you and walks over to one of the guards

&gt; wait to see what happens.

You watch as she approaches the guard. He slowly raises his weapon and points it at the Empress. The Empress smiles and nods in approval. She begins to walk towards you. You quickly turn around and begin to run

&gt; attempt to leap through the window.

You jump through the window and land hard on the ground below. You feel like you are going to pass out from the pain. You look up and see the Empress standing there smiling at you. She waves her hand dismissively. 
&gt; say ""Does this mean I'm fired?""

The Empress shakes her head. ""No, I just wanted to make sure you understood that you will be working under me now"".

You nod and smile back. ""Yes, yes, I get it now.."". You begin to laugh nervously. The Empress laughs along with you
&gt; say ""What are my instructions, highness?""

The Empress shrugs. ""Just follow my lead until we reach our destination"".

&gt; nod my stupid head and follow her.

You follow the Empress into the palace. As soon as you enter the room, you hear the sound of an alarm being sounded. A few moments later, the door opens up and several soldiers rush inside. They immediately start shouting orders at each other. Finally they stop yelling when they notice you

&gt; wait to see what the Empress does.

You continue to wait patiently for the Empress to tell you what to do next. Eventually, she enters the room. She takes a seat by herself. She sits down and begins to speak. 

&gt; listen carefully.

""My child, you are not here to destroy the Empire or even the Dark Order. You are here because you were chosen by the Emperor himself to become his new vessel"".

You stare at the Empress in disbelief. 

&gt;  what does that mean.

""This means that you are now part of the Emperor's inner circle. Your life will now revolve around serving him. You will no longer be able to go about your normal lives, you will only be allowed to do so if it serves the greater good of the Empire""

&gt; what about my work as the official assassin.

""Your work as an assassin has been done. Now you will spend the rest of your life doing nothing more than that"".

&gt; So I'll be doing more assassinations?

""More assassination? Yes, I believe you can guess why I would want you to do such things"".

&gt; nod.

""The Dark Order has grown too powerful. Their influence in the Empire is growing and their activities are becoming increasingly dangerous. It is time to bring them down once and for all"".

&gt; I promise to eradicate them.

""Good boy, now let us talk more about the mission itself"".

&gt; listen to the mission briefing.

You are given a brief briefing on the mission. You are told to infiltrate the Dark Order hideout located deep within the mountains. There you will meet up with the leader of the Dark Order, a man named Kivan. You are also told to assassinate him personally

You quickly gather your belongings and prepare yourself for the journey. You are ready to take off into the unknown.

&gt;  travel to the mountains and infiltrate the Dark Order's hideout.

You travel to the mountain range. You find it quite desolate. You wonder how you could possibly survive here. You decide to set up camp right where you found it. You hope that the dark elves don't come looking for you.

&gt; wake up after well-rested night and make coffee over the campfire while planning for the next step.

You wake up early and prepare yourself for the day ahead. You drink some coffee and eat some meat jerky. You think about the next step you need to take.

&gt; the Dark Order's hideout is somewhere nearby. You need to find it.

You set off into the wilderness. You try to remember where you last saw the Dark Order's hideout. You search for a long time, but you cannot recall anything specific. You eventually give up and return home.

&gt; report to the Empress and tell her you failed the mission.

You report to the Empress and explain that you did indeed fail the mission. She tells you that you should have tried harder. She reminds you that you are still a loyal servant of the Empire and that you will always be rewarded for your service.

&gt; request the reward.

You agree and request the reward. You are surprised when the Empress hands you a small pouch of coins. She explains that these are the coinage of the Empire. She gives you a large amount of gold coins and tells you to keep them safe.

&gt; spend my money on opium and erotic illustrations.

You spend your money on opium and erotic illustrations. You enjoy the drug immensely and never feel any withdrawal symptoms. You spend hours drawing erotic pictures of yourself and your fellow assassins.

&gt; ask to become the imperial erotic illustrator.

You agree and ask to become the Imperial Erotic Illustrator. You are assigned to a small province called the Emerald Province. You are instructed to create erotic paintings depicting the exploits of the local prostitutes

&gt; life is good.

After a year passes, you are promoted to the rank of General. You are then sent out to other provinces to spread the art of erotica throughout the Empire. You are also tasked with creating erotic posters which are used to advertise the various brothels and casinos owned by the Empire

&gt; commission a gigantic nude sculpture of the Empress.

You commission a giant nude statue of the Empress. The statue is made from marble and stands at the entrance to the Emerald Province. You use the funds you receive from selling the statues to fund your own personal expenses.

&gt; go crazy with old age and start just drawing nipples on everything.

You swing your knife at the man and he screams and falls backwards. He tries

 his bones. He cries out as you force him to the ground

 back to the blacksmiths shop because you know they would kill you if they found
 out you had stolen from them. You spend most of your time drinking and whoring

2019-12-12-184508,,That's one way to win,"You are Kindrel, a noble living in the kingdom of Larion. You have a pouch of

gold and a small dagger. You are awakened by one of your servants who tells

you that your keep is under attack. You look out the window and see a group

of orcs charging towards your door

\&gt; tell the archers to fire at the orcs

&amp;#x200B;

You order your men to open fire on the orcs as they come crashing through the

gates. The arrows fly high into the air and hit their targets, but it doesn't

matter; the orcs aren't going down without a fight. Your own troops are getting

overwhelmed by the orcs

\&gt; have my court wizard use magic to fight the orcs

&amp;#x200B;

The orcish horde has already overrun your keep when you call upon the wizards

of the city to help you. They cast a spell that causes the orcs to lose strength

and speed. Soon the orcs are no longer moving and can be easily dispatched

\&gt; capture the orcs and question them in my dungeon

&amp;#x200B;

You decide to take the orcs back to your dungeon where you will interrogate them.

You have your guards drag away the captured orcs and place them in cages.

\&gt; ask one of the orcs why they attacked my keep

&amp;#x200B;

""We were just defending our home!"" says an orc who is being held captive. ""I

heard you were a powerful wizard so I thought we should show you how much we

respect you"".

\&gt; kill him as an example, then ask the next orc why they attacked my keep

&amp;#x200B;

""Because you killed my friend!"" says another orc.

\&gt; ask the orc how I can conquer the orc kingdom

&amp;#x200B;

""We need to unite all the tribes under one banner!"" he exclaims.

\&gt; Go to each orc tribe and promise them gold if they fight under my banner

&amp;#x200B;

You lead your army to the frontlines of the war with the orcs. The orcs seem

eager for battle and ready to die for their cause.

\&gt; Seduce the orc queen to join my side

&amp;#x200B;

You sneak up behind the orc queen and kiss her before she can react. She seems

surprised, but accepts your advances. After a few moments of passionate kissing,

you pull out your dagger and stab her repeatedly in the neck. Her blood splatters

on your face and you feel sick

\&gt; disguise myself as an orc and take her place

&amp;#x200B;

You disguise yourself as an orc and take over the throne of the orc nation. You

have a lot more power now and can do whatever you want. You have a lot of orcs

fighting alongside you though.

\&gt; I crave more power and seek out the greatest wizard of the realm

&amp;#x200B;

You decide that you will seek out the greatest wizard of the realm. You begin

to study him intensely. You learn all about his spells and even read through

his books. Eventually you manage to defeat him in combat. You slay him and claim

victory

\&gt; burn all the books in the mages library so that no one else may learn this power

&amp;#x200B;

You burn all the books in the library so that no one else may learn this power.

You destroy the libraries and kill every mage in the land

\&gt; Use my magic to consort with extraplanar deities

&amp;#x200B;

You use your magic to consort with extraplanar deities. You create a new race

called the kobolds..

\&gt; Found a city for kobolids surrounded by impenetrable walls

&amp;#x200B;

You discover a city called Kol. You build a wall around it and call it Kol. The

kobolds...

\&gt; I appear to the kobolids through visions so that they believe I am a god

&amp;#x200B;

You appear to the kobolds through visions so that they believe you are a god.

They worship you and live in peace and prosperity. You even have children. You

rule over them with an. You even have a daughter named after you.

2019-12-12-194359,,chicken speed run,"
You are a chicken on a farm. You are walking around pecking, flapping, and other
 chickenly things. The farmer walks by and opens the gate to your pen then he
 says ""Hey you chickens look tired""
&gt; cluck

The farmer looks at you and smiles and waves his hand in front of your face.
 He points to a patch of dirt and says ""Look there's some old chicken shit over
 there"". Then he points to another patch of dirt and says 
&gt; Grow larger to the size of two chickens

He points to a third patch of dirt and says ""There's some old chicken shit over
 there too"". Then he points to a fourth patch of dirt and says 
&gt; cluck

You cluck loudly, but quietly enough that no one else hears you. The farmer is
 pleased with your performance and you are rewarded by him giving you a few coins
 for your efforts.

Afterwards you return home and tell your parents what happened
&gt; cluck

They both look at each other and laugh. They say ""Yes, yes, we all know how you
 like to play"" and they give you a big hug
&gt; cluck

Your mother tells you to go outside and she'll teach you something new every
 day. You agree and spend most of your free time learning about birds. Eventually
 you learn everything there is to know about them. Your parents don't mind though,
 they just want you to be happy
&gt; cluck

One day while you're playing in the garden, you hear a noise from above. It sounds
 like a flock of geese flying overhead. You run up to the top of the garden and
 see several geese flying around the house
&gt; fly up to them

You quickly fly up to the geese and start pecking at their feathers. You make
 a lot of noise as you do this and the geese stop flying around the house and
 stare at you in wonder. One of them flies off towards the trees and another
 one comes back to the house
&gt; cluck

You cluck loudly and the geese come closer to investigate. When they get close
 enough you begin to sing
&gt; Begin sining Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody

You begin singing Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody. The geese are amazed by your voice
 and begin to follow you. Soon you have gathered quite a crowd of geese who all
 listen intently to your song
&gt; Command the geese to build me a house

You begin building a large house out of the geese's feathers. You finish it in
 a couple days and then you put it on display in the garden. Everyone loves it
 and you become very popular
&gt; cluck

Soon you find yourself being chased by a group of people who think you've done
 a good job. You manage to escape but only after running through the streets
 of town
&gt; cluck

Eventually you manage to hide away in a cave and wait for the next attack. This
 happens about six months later when a giant named Trelik attacks the village.
 He manages to destroy part of the village before you arrive. You defeat him
 easily and take his money.
&gt; lay an egg

You lay an egg which hatches into a small bird. The bird is so small that it
 can barely fly. You name it 'Little Bird' because its so tiny. Little Bird grows
 up to be a very intelligent bird who knows many things about different animals
 and plants
&gt; lay another egg

This time you lay an egg which hatches into a huge bird. The bird is so big that
 it can fly anywhere you wish. You name it 'Big Bird'. Big Bird grows up to be
 a very strong bird who can eat anything that you throw at it

You lay a golden egg which hatches into a dragon. The dragon is incredibly powerful
 and will eat anything that you throw at it. You kill it and take its treasure

2019-12-12-214521,,A day in the life of Darth Vader,"Just for context, I had just played as Greedo, killed Han Solo and kicked Vader in the balls. Also, it turns somewhat sexual towards the end, so I marked it as NSFW just in case.

 You are Darth Vader. You have just been kicked in the robo-nuts by a Rodian. I'm going to make this quick, because you're not getting away with this \*\*\*\*  

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; order the stormtroopers to shoot the fucking Rodian.

&amp;#x200B;

 You order your troops to fire upon the fleeing Rodian. The Rodian is hit and falls from his bike. He tries to run, but he can't outrun the Imperials. His legs buckle under him as he falls off his bike 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; say ""finish him off""   

&amp;#x200B;

  The troopers open fire at the falling body of the Rodian. Bullets tear through flesh and bone. Blood pours down onto the ground. A few of the troopers even manage to kill their targets, but most of them get killed by the bullets. It's a massacre  

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; run back to my ship while giggling

&amp;#x200B;

  You race back to your ship as fast as you can. Your troops are still shooting at the fleeing Rodian. You try to reach your shuttle just in time for it to leave the system. You don't have long though. A trooper fires at you, hitting you in the leg 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; say ""FUCK""

&amp;#x200B;

  Your leg explodes  

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; force choke the traitor.

&amp;#x200B;

   You attempt to choke the traitor, but he manages to escape. You immediately go after him. You catch up with him in an alleyway. You punch him several times in the face before he can react. You take him into custody  

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; bring him to my ship.

&amp;#x200B;

   You bring the traitor to your ship where he is put in a cell. You then tell your troops to start preparing the ship for jump. You also tell your troops that they need to be ready to launch within two hours. You then head back to your room where you continue to enjoy yourself  

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; arrive at Coruscant.

&amp;#x200B;

   You arrive at Coruscant. You land your ship in the middle of the city. You make sure to avoid any civilians. You quickly walk around the city taking pictures of everything. You spend the next couple days taking more photos. You finally decide to go to the Senate building  

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; take the traitor to Palpatine.

&amp;#x200B;

   You enter the Senate building. You see the traitor there. You grab him and throw him against the wall. You kick him in the stomach and break his nose. You then shove a blaster pistol into his mouth  

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; make him beg for his life.

&amp;#x200B;

   You pull the trigger, killing the traitor. You then look at your camera and laugh. You take a shower and relax for awhile  

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; meet Palpatine.

&amp;#x200B;

   You arrive at the palace. You enter the elevator. You press the button down. You hear a click followed by a soft hum. You enter the throne room. You see Palpatine standing there. He smiles at you. You smile back. You shake hands. You talk about your adventures 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; take off helmet and kiss Palpatine

&amp;#x200B;

  You remove your helmet and kiss Palpatine on the lips. You feel like this is  going to last forever 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; insert tongue

&amp;#x200B;

  You push the button again and you feel something hard inside you. You pull it out and it is a big black rod. You insert your finger into it and it feels really weird. You then insert your tongue and it tastes horrible. You spit it out and  vomit 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; put helmet back on

&amp;#x200B;

  You put the helmet back on and you feel better already. You exit the throne room and walk around the palace. You find that the Empire has been restored. You see all the people cheering and waving flags. You also see the Emperor himself.  He looks happy too 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; run to his side

&amp;#x200B;

  You run towards the Emperor. You hug him and kiss him on the cheek. You then give him a big bear hug. You both fall to the floor laughing. You then give him a big kiss on the forehead 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; take my big black metallic rod and insert it in Palpatine's anus

&amp;#x200B;

  You do exactly what the Emperor says. You insert your rod into his \*\*\*.  You watch as it slowly begins to penetrate him. You watch as it goes deeper and deeper until it's completely in. You watch as it starts pumping its load  deep into Palpatine's bowels 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Force cum

&amp;#x200B;

  You feel so good. You then stand up and celebrate with your troops. They cheer and clap. You then go back to your room and collapse on your bed. You lay there  for a little bit and enjoy yourself 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; watch holo-tv

&amp;#x200B;

  You sit in front of your holo-TV. You watch a series called ""Empire Strikes Back"".  You laugh and laugh. You laugh and laugh. You laugh and laugh. You laugh and laugh. You laugh and laugh. You laugh and laugh. You laugh and laugh

 You are awakened by one of your servants who tells you that your keep is under attack.

 You look out the window and see a large army marching towards your door. They will be here soon

&amp;#x200B;

**&gt; You dress up in set of your plate armor and get your equipment.**

&amp;#x200B;

You grab your sword and shield from your room and prepare yourself for battle.

 You then head to your bedroom where you put on your armor. You then go

 downstairs to find some food and drink

&amp;#x200B;

**&gt; You quickly eat something before the battle.**

&amp;#x200B;

You quickly finish eating something and start preparing yourself for battle.

 You then take a quick shower and change into clean clothes. You then head

 back upstairs to your room. You put on your new armor and weapons. You then

 head outside to meet your troops.

&amp;#x200B;

**&gt; rally your troops located on keep walls**

&amp;#x200B;

You gather your troops and march out onto the streets. You see that there is

 no way to stop you from reaching the city. You also notice that the soldiers

 all look very tired. They don't seem like they want to fight at all

\&gt; do inspiring speech about defending our keep against attacking orcs

You begin to speak about how you will defend your keep and how it is important

 to stay strong for your family. You then tell them to be ready to attack when

 needed. You then give a short speech and then leave

&amp;#x200B;

**&gt; prepare your army to defent the castle against orc army**

&amp;#x200B;

You send out an order to your troops to prepare their defenses. You then march

 out with your army towards the city. You soon reach the gates of the city and

 see that the orcs are already inside. The orcs are very large and well armored

\&gt; attempt to push orcs behind the city gates

&amp;#x200B;

You charge forward and try to push the orcs back. You can hear them roaring and

 shouting as you push them back. You eventually manage to push them back but

 not far enough. You watch as the orcs break through the walls and rush inside

 the city. You watch as the walls collapse around you

&amp;#x200B;

**&gt; defend the city and your castle with everything you can**

&amp;#x200B;

You stand by the wall and watch as the walls crumble around you. You watch as

 the orcs enter the city and kill everyone in sight. You watch as the walls fall

 and the city explodes into flames

&amp;#x200B;

**&gt; try to flank the orcs attacking the city with you and your troops**

&amp;#x200B;

You run forward and throw a few javelins at the orcs. You then turn around and

 run back to your troops who are still fighting the orcs. You yell at your troops

 to hold off the orcs while you and your troops escape the city

&amp;#x200B;

**&gt; attempt to evacuate your remaining troops and still alive civilians**

&amp;#x200B;

You shout at your troops to move away from the city and try to get as many people

 as possible out of the city. You manage to save most of your troops but you

 lose several. You watch as the walls fall and the city explodes into flames

&amp;#x200B;

**&gt; send someone from your troops as messenger to your liege Duke Karl, explaining the actual situation and asking for military support**

&amp;#x200B;

You send one of your own troops to report to your liege Duke Karl. He tells you

 that he has heard about what happened in the city and is willing to help you

 in any way he can. You agree to this offer and send him to his destination

&amp;#x200B;

**&gt; combine my remaining troops with Duke army**

&amp;#x200B;

You decide to join Duke Karl's forces. You lead your troops and retake the city

 of Klyton from the orcs. You defeat the orcs and save the citizens. Your victory

 is short lived however as you learn that the orcs have been planning to invade

 again

&amp;#x200B;

**&gt; discuss possible actions to prevent attack on the city with Duke**

&amp;#x200B;

You discuss the possibility of sending a message to Duke Karl warning him of

 the impending invasion. You decide to send a messenger to warn him. You send

 a messenger to the Duke and explain the situation. You explain that you were

 attacked by orcs and that you need help

&amp;#x200B;

**&gt; wait for response**

&amp;#x200B;

You wait patiently for a reply from Duke Karl. A week passes and you receive

 a letter from him. It reads:

&amp;#x200B;

**&gt; read**

&amp;#x200B;

The Duke writes that he will send reinforcements soon and that he hopes you won't

 suffer too much loss. He also says that he hopes you will return safely to your

 home. You thank the Duke for his kindness and write back thanking him for his

 help. You then head back to your home

&amp;#x200B;

**&gt; conscript to militia people able to fight from villagers and still alive townsmen and add it to your army**

&amp;#x200B;

You send another messenger to the Duke and ask if he needs more men. He replies

 that he does and asks if you would like to conscript some peasants to serve

 in your militia. You agree and send a messenger to the peasant village to recruit

 them

&amp;#x200B;

**&gt; recruit militia and order your soldiers to train them**

&amp;#x200B;

You send a messenger to the peasant village to recruit them. You instruct your

 soldiers to train the peasants so that they may become efficient soldiers. You

 also order your soldiers to make sure that they are fully prepared for war

&amp;#x200B;

**&gt; recruit huntsmen in my army**

&amp;#x200B;

You send a messenger to the peasant village to recruit them. You instruct your

 soldiers to train the peasants so that they may become efficient hunters

&amp;#x200B;

You send a messenger to the peasant village to recruit them. You instruct your

 soldiers to hunt down the orcs in the forest and try to stay hidden

&amp;#x200B;

**&gt; stop sending a messenger and listen to my orders for fucks sake**

You send a messenger to the peasant village to recruit them. You instruct your

 soldiers to stop sending scouts and spies and spies

You are Robombo, a squire living in the kingdom of Larion. You have a spear and
 a pack of supplies. You follow Sir Theo as he enters the forest, he turns to
 you and says ""I'm going to go into the forest now""
&gt; watch The Game Awards 2019 with Geoff Keighley

The next day you get up early and head to the studio where you find Geoff Keighley
 sitting at his desk. He is wearing a t-shirt that reads 'I love you' on it.
 His hair is short and his eyes are round like a pear.


&gt; hello Geoff

Geoff smiles at you and says ""Hello"" before continuing to stare at his laptop
 screen. You smile back and say ""Hi"". Geoff's face lights up and he says ""Thank
 you!"" You both laugh and then you both start talking about your day
&gt; kiss Geoff Keighley

Geoff kisses you on the cheek and says ""Goodbye"" as he turns around and walks
 away from his desk. You turn around and walk after him. You run up the stairs
 and into the bedroom where you see Geoff lying naked on his bed
&gt; offer Geoff Doritos

You grab Geoff by the hand and pull him out of the room. You both go outside
 and into the car. You drive off and you both sit in the backseat while watching
 TV.
&gt; eat doritos and drink mountain dew

You put down the food and drink Mountain Dew and Doritos. You begin to talk about
 your day. You tell Geoff how you spent the morning going to the studio where
 you watched the awards ceremony. You explain what happened when you were there
&gt; ask Geoff what happened

Geoff tells you ""Oh, I got mugged"". You both laugh and then you both continue
 to talk about your day.
&gt; rub geoff keighley's inner thigh

Geoff looks over at you and smiles. He reaches over and starts rubbing your leg.
 You smile back and tell him ""That feels really nice"". Geoff pulls you close
 and whispers in your ear ""We should do this more often"". You smile and nod.
 You both fall asleep
&gt; wake up

You awake to a loud noise. It sounds like an explosion or something. You look
 out the window and see a mushroom cloud rising above the city. You hear shouting
 and screaming. You quickly rush out of your room and open the door to the kitchen
&gt; scream for Geoff

You scream for Geoff. You run to the front door and throw it open. You see Geoff
 standing in the doorway holding a pistol. You shout ""GET THE **** OUT OF HERE
 YOU DUMB *******!"". Geoff slowly backs inside but keeps walking until he is

2019-12-13-072125,,"The Darkest Timeline of ""IT""","    You are Bill Denborough of Derry, Maine. You have a large silver bike, a slingshot,
    and a massive erection. You stand on a deserted street and notice out of the
    corner of your eye a pair of glowing eyes peering at you out of a storm drain.
    
    &gt; look at storm drain
    
    The storm drain is huge and looks like it could swallow you whole if you were
    not careful. The drain leads into a sewer grate which opens up to an alleyway
    &gt; notice clown in storm drain
    
    You see a clown standing by the drain looking down at you. He has big round glasses
    that cover his entire face and a red nose. His clothes are ripped and dirty
    with holes all over him. It appears he hasn't bathed or showered in days
    &gt; wave at clown
    
    You wave at the clown and he waves back, then you both go on your way
    &gt; go back to georgie
    
    You walk back to georgie who is still talking to himself about how he can't believe
    you didn't come out of the house. You think about what you saw in the drain
    and decide to check it out.
    &gt; check out storm drain
    
    You head towards the drain and start walking down it when you suddenly hear a
    noise behind you. You turn around and see a man dressed in black holding a shotgun
    pointing it right at you. You immediately drop to the ground and try to crawl
    away but the man keeps shooting at you
    &gt; shoot man with slingshot
    
    You shoot the man with the slingshot. He falls backwards and drops the gun as
    he hits the floor. You run over to him and pick up the gun before running off
    &gt; call police
    
    You call the police and they arrive soon after. They search the area for any
    other suspects and find nothing else suspicious so they let you go
    &gt; hunt down man dressed in black and finish the job
    
    You follow the man dressed in black through the sewers and eventually get to
    the sewers where he was hiding. You chase him down and kill him. You take the
    gun from him and use it to kill another man later on.
    &gt; accept fate as serial killer
    
    You accept your fate as a serial killer and leave the sewers. You have killed
    many people since you first came here
    &gt; check if georgie is alive
    
    You check to make sure georgie is still alive and find that he is not. You also
    check the sewers again and find no trace of him either. You don't know why this
    happened but you just feel very sad.
    &gt; find Pennywise and offer to team up with him
    
    You head back to the park and find Pennywise waiting for you there. He tells
    you that he will help you fight him together. He says that he knows how to control
    the children better than anyone else does and he thinks he would be able to
    bring them under his control

    **CRASH**
    
    **RESUME**
    
    You are Bill Denborough of Derry, serial killer and former meat pie baron turned
    government bodyguard. You frequenly go into fugue states and lose track of where
    you are. You think you have a friend named ""Diana"" who texts you about having
    to shit a lot. You decide one day to seek out Pennywise and restart the meat
    pie business...
    
    ""Hello? Is anyone there?""
    
    The voice is deep and masculine, like a man's voice should be. It comes from
    behind a door in the darkness
    &gt; say ""Who goes there?""
    
    ""Who goes there?"" you ask back as loud as you can. The voice doesn't answer.
    Suddenly, you feel something grab your arm. You turn around to see Pennywise
    the Dancing Clown standing over you with his finger on your pulse
    &gt; say ""Pennywise thank god you're here I missed you so much. Let's go back to Derry.""
    
    ""No, no, no! We need to get away from this town!""
    ""What do you mean?""
    ""It's not safe here! There's monsters everywhere!""
    
    &gt; say ""what kind of monsters?""
    
    ""Oh, all kinds! Monsters like those things that chased me last night and chased
    my sister down into the sewers! Or those clowns who were chasing us before!""
    &gt; say ""Pennywise, you're a clown, though. Are you scared of clowns?""
    ""I'm not scared of them! They're just...funny looking.."".
    &gt; say ""Listen, I'm sick of living off the government. We need to sell meat pies again. Like the old days.""
    
    ""Meat Pies? What the ** are you talking about?""
    &gt; say ""We used to have meat pie stores all accross america, don't you remember? Then we tried to sell the Meatball Sandwich and enact child labor laws and everything went downhill...""
    
    ""You know what happened next right? We had to move our store to a different state
    because people were getting too rowdy in it"".
    &gt; say ""We had to move all the stores, Pennywise. We had to move them to being closed. Because nobody was buying our meat pies.""
    
    ""Yeah, yeah, whatever. Come on let's go back to Derry. It'll be safer there"".
    &gt; go to Derry with Pennywise
    
    The two of you drive back to Derry, but when you arrive, you find that the town
    is now completely deserted. You drive for hours until you finally come across
    the diner where you first saw Pennywise. You park your car outside and walk
    inside

\&gt; You look in the mirror to see if you're a goose.

You look into the mirror and see that you are indeed a goose. You are now a normal goose who has just woken up from her nap. She walks over to the window and pecks at it, which causes the birds outside to sing. She then eats an egg and drinks some milk

\&gt; You go outside and honk at the neighbors.

You head outside and start honking loudly. You then wait for them to come outside. Eventually they do and you wave at them. They wave back and you continue honking. Soon you are surrounded by dozens of people who are all staring at you

\&gt; You bite someone with your goose teeth.

You suddenly lunge forward and bite one person with each of your front teeth. You then turn around and lick their faces before running off. This causes everyone to laugh hysterically. Everyone thinks you are crazy and runs away from you

\&gt; You chase after the neighbors.

You run after the neighbors, but they are already gone. You follow them, but they are nowhere to be found. You keep following them, but they never return. You begin to panic and scream, but no one hears you. Finally, you give up and lie down in the grass

\&gt; use your beak to steal the neighbors rake

You stand up and walk towards the neighbor's house. You see a rake sitting there

 and think ""I'll take that"". You pick it up and put it in your mouth. Then you

 start to fly through the air. You land on top of the neighbor's house and jump

 onto his roof

\&gt; take the rake to the nearby lake and toss the rake in the lake

You hop down from the roof and run to the neighbor's house. You throw the rake

 into the lake and swim away. Unfortunately, you drown when you hit the water.

 You sink slowly to the bottom of the lake where you die

2019-12-13-133025,,I have no clue what just happened,"Posting everything that just happened in this extremely cursed playthrough (had the AI die on me near the end and so I guess the timelines split)

I wanted to see how the AI handled really big prompts so I copied and pasted a sheet I had lying around describing a species I designed.

The Steli are a highly nomadic race, notably being so endeared to this idea that their very bodies can change appearance through the manipulation of their constant stem cell production, a relic of their original homeworld where radiation forced them to have a very active immune system to fight off cancers and rapidly repair dead cells. They have been spacefaring for so long that even their oldest records are unsure of when they adopted this attitude, ask any Steli how far their race has spread across the universe and they’re likely to respond stating they don’t know, nobody does. It’s common knowledge that there is no way to definitively know just how far they have come and where their own homeworld is, even they don’t know.  General Description: Shapeshifters by nature, common traits among the Steli are large heads with a hunched spine, long legs leading to a normally very tall stature up to 2.4 meters. Larger Steli tend towards hexapedal status with highly developed musculature. A universal trait is they often have thick layers of dead cells built up into large cells reminiscent of scales covering their body, they do not naturally possess eyes, instead using a form of electromagnetic sensing to, effectively, see the surrounding radiation, this can include the visual spectrum and if needed, a Steli will alter their body to possess working eyes specifically to see in the visual spectrum with high fidelity. Steli are lead based, being able to resist extreme levels of hard radiation, this has lead to them commonly not using radiation shielding onboard their ships. Another notably interesting feature is an extremely active immune system, affording them a very high degree of protection against disease. It is a common assumption that complex life needs to be aerobic, this is more or less correct for the Steli, though it should be noted that their bodies have evolved to be capable of shutting down major functions to allow survival on anaerobic processes when needed, this puts major strain on the body, however and is usually followed by several months of laying about in a medical bed. Due to various issues with integrating lots of text, I’m going to define a smaller human sized body plan in a new paragraph. The smaller (more standard) Steli bodyplan is a quadrupedal form nearly 1.8m tall, they possess the same large head with long arms and legs.  Because I am lazy, I am adding in the exact way they see the surrounding area after the fact instead of working it into the previous text, Steli have a lattice structure of organic electromagnetic receivers laced into their nervous system coupled with periodic nodes that can be argued to be “eye” equivalents. These are able to sense EM waves of wavelengths roughly 0.8 centimeters to around 13 nanometers. If a Steli decides to develop eyes, they tend to not be functional, instead just a dense EM sensing node and only outwardly looks kind of like an eye.  The KAM One of a few races who inhabit the Steli Nomadic Fleet, KAM are an ancient species of AI who prefer to inhabit bodies of programmable matter (PM) controlled through Quantum Entanglement Devices (QEDs) placed in their cores, it’s theoretically impossible to actually destroy a KAM’s body through a kinetic implement, as the PM can simply reshape itself around the attack. That said, their primary form of energy intake is through ambient electromagnetic energy fields, with the majority of said power coming from infrared energy (heat), it is possible to overload a body through subjecting it to extreme heat and thus overpowering it’s ability to store all that energy, forcing it to discharge into the surroundings, which will char and damage the PM. The cores that these AI run in are spread across the various hypercomputers in the eight worldships, a known total of around twelve million KAM exist, population growth has so far halted in the realization of a lack of existing space, there are large data centers being constructed inside unused space on the ships to allow for population growth to restart.  The Aynci Aynci are a sentient race native to the planet Aynci, they are a technologically advanced race, but due to their planet being a hot desert, they have never ventured out beyond their home worl

\&gt; You observe surroundings.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You take a deep breath, trying to calm yourself. You walk forward slowly, taking your time to get used to the situation. You look around you, noticing the many buildings scattered around the city

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You calm down, observe buildings.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You continue walking, looking at everything, not really seeing anything special, then suddenly you notice something odd, a small metal box sitting in the middle of the road, its lid closed. You quickly move over to it, before realizing what you've done, you feel sick

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You open box.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You open the box, finding a large, black, metallic object inside. It's shape is similar to that of a pistol, but much larger and more powerful. You pick it up, inspecting it closely

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You inspect object.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The gun feels very heavy, as if it was made out of some sort of metal with a lot of weight behind it. The barrel seems to be made from some sort of dark green material, and has several small holes drilled into it

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You fire gun at sky.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You walk north.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You walk north, feeling slightly uncomfortable about this strange event that just occurred to you

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You observe surroundings.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You keep walking, until you reach a bridge, which connects two different parts of the city. You decide to cross it, heading towards the other part of the city

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You observe city.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As you cross the bridge, you find yourself in a completely different part of the city. There are no signs of civilization here, only trees and grass

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You look for humans.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You look around, finding no sign of any human life, so you head back to where you came from

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You wonder where everyone went.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You walk through the streets again, wondering why you're not hearing anyone calling out to you or asking you questions

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You look around.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You see nothing out of place, so you continue exploring the city

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You enter a building.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You enter a building, finding that it's completely empty, and you hear no noise whatsoever

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You look closely at the surroundings.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You examine the room carefully, finding nothing out of place, so you leave the building

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You look for out of place things.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You walk along the street, thinking about how strange it all is, before you realize that there isn't even a single person in sight

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You look for that box.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You walk along the street, looking for the box you saw earlier, but you don't find it, so you return home

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You observe home.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You walk through the house, finding that it's exactly like when you left it, except for one thing...

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You what's that one thing.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You look around, noticing that the walls have been painted a darker color than usual, and the floor is covered with dried blood

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You investigate dried blood.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You run outside, discovering that the ground has also been stained red

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You pull out the gun.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You pull out the gun, firing it at the ground, causing it to explode in a burst of dirt and dust

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You keep walking, noticing that the sun has set, and you can now clearly see the sky

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You go to sleep.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You lie down on your bed, closing your eyes, before falling asleep

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You wake up.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You look for gun.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You search the nearby area, finding nothing out of place, so you continue searching

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You grab the gun.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You grab the gun, aiming it at the ground, pulling the trigger, causing it to shoot a bolt of flame, setting the ground alight

You say ""Is anybody there?""

&amp;#x200B;

""No"" comes the reply""Good"" you think as you begin to walk away from the scene of the crime, leaving the burnt earth behindYou continue walking, until you reach an old abandoned house, which looks very similar to the one you were in before

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You investigate source of the reply.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You enter the house, finding that it's exactly the same as the last time you were here, save for one thing...

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You look closely at the blood.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You inspect the blood, noticing that it's blood that hasn't dried yet, meaning that it must be fresh

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You investigate.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You continue inspecting the blood, finding that it's blood that doesn't belong anywhere near this house, meaning that it must come from somewhere else

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You exit the house.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You exit the house, exiting back into the real world

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You observe the world.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You find that the grass isn't greener, but rather, brown

You say ""Why is the grass brown?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Because I was playing hide-and-seek with my friends when we ran into some kids who threw rocks at us, burning our skin and hair"" you respond, surprised by your own revelationYou continue walking, eventually reaching a lake

2019-12-13-140619,,Few questions,"Hello. I am playing aidungeon for few days and have few questions about it.

&amp;#x200B;

1. I know that ai is limited to last 8 commands and it's responses. I have also heard that it keeps in mind whole custom prompt. My problem is, usually it just forgots informations mentioned there.  Am I doing something wrong or i have to accept those limitations?
2. I have heard that when ai starts to do weird things and you want to have longer story, you should just get your prompt, extend it by key informations and use as a new game. I am using it and it works fine, but is there a limit to the length of the prompt?
3. Is there a way to prevent repetition? I mean, sometimes AI responds with 2 normal sentences and 1 sentence, that is repeated like 10 times. I usually do a revert or retry ( added by a mod) and it works only sometimes.
4. The last one. Is there a way to make AI not forcing me to do something? I mean, sometimes there is a point in the game, when after every action it says that i go to sleep, leave the room or something else. It's a little bit annoying. Has anyone managed to prevent it?

Right now AI Dungeon only uses the last 8 responses when generating the next step of the story. This means if an important aspect of the story hasn't been mentioned in the last 8 prompts it drops off. 

I've been thinking that I'd like to implement a checkpoint command that forces the most recent prompt to stay in the queue forever (or until you choose a different checkpoint).

 sister, who is about to give birth to twins, and you think she looks pretty.

 She has long blonde hair and blue eyes

\&gt; grab a sword and train swordsmanship

&amp;#x200B;

You quickly grab a sword from the ground and start training with it. It's not

 like you've ever used one before, but you figure you can at least practice with

 them.

&amp;#x200B;

""Hey! Stop!"" A voice shouts behind you. 

\&gt; turn around

&amp;#x200B;

You turn around and see a man holding a bow. ""Whoa! Whoa! What the hell?"" He

 says as he takes aim. The man shoots and hits you right in the chest. You fall

 backwards and scream out in pain. 

\&gt; call family

&amp;#x200B;

You call for your family to come help you. They arrive and take you back home.

 Your mother is very upset about what happened. She tells you that she'll go

 get some medical supplies and bring them here

\&gt; wait for her

&amp;#x200B;

You sit on the floor crying for awhile. You don't know why, but you just feel

 so sad. Eventually you manage to calm down and think about how you're going

 to deal with this situation

\&gt; wait

&amp;#x200B;

You decide to wait until your mom comes back. You wait patiently for her to return.

 When she does, you tell her everything that has happened. She seems very worried

 about you and asks if you want to stay with her or go somewhere else

\&gt; stay with her

&amp;#x200B;

You agree to stay with her. After all, you need someone to talk to. You spend

 most of your time alone in your room. You begin to wonder if you should try

 to leave the castle, but then you remember that you still owe money to the king

\&gt; meet with the king

&amp;#x200B;

You decide to head to the king's chambers. You walk through the halls and finally

 reach his chambers. As soon as you enter, you immediately notice that there

 is something wrong. There is no door to the room. Instead, there is a large

 stone slab with a hole cut into it

\&gt; enter through the hole

&amp;#x200B;

You enter through the hole and find yourself in a small room with a table and

 several chairs. On top of the table sits a man dressed in black robes. His face

 is covered by a hooded cloak and his eyes are hidden beneath a pair of dark

 glasses

\&gt; ask if he is the king

&amp;#x200B;

""Yes,"" he replies. ""I am"".

\&gt; equip sword

&amp;#x200B;

""What do you mean? I'm not the king"".

\&gt; attack the king

&amp;#x200B;

The king looks surprised when you suddenly appear in front of him. He tries to

 dodge, but you easily catch him off guard. He falls backwards onto the floor

 and you land on top of him. You struggle to pull the sword out of his throat

\&gt; finish him

&amp;#x200B;

You slice open the king's throat and plunge the blade deep into his body

\&gt; say ""gg ez""

 down at the corpse of the king and realize that you have killed him

 without question. They also become loyal to you and will never rebel against

 This results in many deaths and panic. Some of the peasants attempt to escape,

 but you stop them from doing so

&amp;#x200B;

You change your sword into a giant fart and use it to kill dozens of peasants.

\&gt; use fart to control the planet

&amp;#x200B;

 The peasants flee into the mountains where they hide away from the sun. A few

 brave ones venture outside and discover that the world is now burning

You become the ruler of the planet. You can now create anything you desire. You

 all over yourself and fall unconscious. When you wake up, you find yourself

 lying naked on a bed with a woman who appears to be your girlfriend

\&gt; have \*\*\* with woman

You lie next to her and begin having \*\*\* with her. She seems very interested

 in you and tells you how much she loves you. You kiss her passionately and soon

You have monkey babies. They grow quickly and are strong

 and meet an old man who gives you a book containing information about other

 dimensions. He says he has been studying them for years and wants you to read

 it. You agree and read the book

\&gt; read book

&amp;#x200B;

You read the book and learn that there are many different types of dimensional

 you flee. As Hitler you must start a new life. You have no family, no friends

 and no possessions. All that remains is your will to survive and the skills

 to do so.

&amp;#x200B;

The only thing you can think about is how you want to escape this place

\&gt; &gt; Look around for an escape

&amp;#x200B;

You need to find some way out of here. There is nothing left for you here. You

 feel like you are going insane. You see a door and decide to try it. It seems

 to be locked though. You can't even open it with your strength alone

\&gt; Search for sharp heavy objects

&amp;#x200B;

You grab a nearby chair and swing it at the lock. You manage to pry it open just

 enough to get inside. You then turn on the light switch and see a small window.

 You could probably crawl through there if you had to

\&gt; Smash the window with head

&amp;#x200B;

You slam your fist into the glass shattering it completely. The room goes dark

 and you hear the sound of glass breaking. You begin to panic again as you realize

 that you have broken the windows in this house. You don't know what else you

 could do now

\&gt; Climb out of the window

&amp;#x200B;

You run up the ladder and jump down onto the ground below. You fall several feet

 before you finally stop feeling sick. You slowly stand back up and check to

 make sure everything is still working. You also notice that the light has returned

 to the room

\&gt; Run outside

&amp;#x200B;

You rush outside only to find that you can't move. Your body feels like its about

 to explode from all the pain you're experiencing. You scream for help but no

 one comes. You start to panic and cry until you pass out

\&gt; Run to Austria

&amp;#x200B;

You wake up in a hospital bed. You don't remember how you got here or why you're

 here. All you know is that you've been given a lot of pills and told that you'll

 recover soon. You don't really care though, you just want to go home

\&gt; Take out gun

&amp;#x200B;

You quickly reach for your pistol, which you find under the pillow. You pull

 it out and aim it at yourself. You think about shooting yourself in the chest,

 but decide against it since you don't want to risk killing yourself. Instead

 you shoot yourself in the leg

\&gt; shoot everyone in the hospital

&amp;#x200B;

You fire your pistol at the ceiling and hope that whoever's there hears it. You

 wait a few minutes and then you hear someone coming down the stairs. You immediately

 drop your pistol and run towards the stairs. You run past several people who

 are standing in the hallway

\&gt; Shoot them all

&amp;#x200B;

You run down the stairs and open fire on the first person you see. They're wearing

 a white lab coat so you assume they must be a doctor. You fire several shots

 at him, hitting him multiple times. He falls backwards and you continue firing

 at the next person you see

\&gt; Kill all the babies

&amp;#x200B;

As you fire at the last baby, you suddenly realize that you haven't killed anyone

 yet. You continue firing at the doctors legs until he falls over dead. You continue

 firing at the other people as well, but they're too far away to hit

\&gt; Snipe them

&amp;#x200B;

You continue firing at the doctors body until you finally reach his head. You

 carefully place your rifle against his skull and pull the trigger. You pull

 the trigger and nothing happens. You stare at the empty chamber and then you

 realize that you didn't actually kill anyone

\&gt; Finish them off

&amp;#x200B;

You walk over to the bodies of the doctors and begin looking for anything that

 might give you more information on where you should go next. You eventually

 come across a file folder labeled ""Hospital Records"". You open it up and read

 through it

\&gt; 

. It looks like you've found the answers you were looking for

&amp;#x200B;

. A map of the hospital was included, showing you exactly where to go next.

\&gt; Find the terminal illness ward

&amp;#x200B;

You open up the hospital records and begin reading through the files. After a

 few hours of searching, you find something that catches your eye. It's a list

 of names and numbers. You pick one name and begin reading the file.

\&gt; 

&amp;#x200B;

 

The name is William Henry. The number is 523-1241.

 

It says that William Henry was born on September 26th, 1948. His birth date doesn't

 seem very significant, but it does match the day when you first met Alison

&amp;#x200B;

.

 

The next entry is a little more interesting. It says that William Henry was diagnosed

 with terminal cancer at age thirty two.

 

He died on November 11th, 2007

\&gt; Find someone alive with cancer

&amp;#x200B;

 of numbers and letters. It says that the first letter of each number corresponds

 to the next letter

You continue to search through the hospital records and find more entries. Some

 of these are about patients who have died while others have recovered

\&gt; Leave

&amp;#x200B;

You leave the hospital and head to the nearest town. As you drive along, you

 notice that the road seems to be getting worse and worse. You try to avoid driving

 on roads that are clearly marked as bad for traffic, but you get into an accident

 anyway

\&gt; Do a driveby at the petrol station

&amp;#x200B;

You park your car near the petrol station and walk inside. You grab a bottle

 of water and fill it up with gasoline. You throw the bottle at the sign above

 the door and watch as it explodes. You also set the building on fire

\&gt; Run

&amp;#x200B;

You run from the burning building and start running for your life. You manage

 to escape the flames and make it back to the safety of the house, but you're

 not sure if you made it

\&gt; Fly to London

&amp;#x200B;

You fly to London and spend the rest of the night in bed recovering from your

 burns. The following morning you wake up and decide that you need to get out

 of this city as soon as possible

\&gt; Find Winston Churchill

&amp;#x200B;

You head to the nearby airport and board a plane bound for New York. You arrive

 safely in New York City and take a cab to Winston Churchill's home. When you

 arrive, you find that Churchill has left the house and gone into hiding

\&gt; Look for him

&amp;#x200B;

You follow the directions given by the taxi driver and follow the instructions

 given to you by the directions given to you by the taxi driver

\&gt; Talk to Winston CHURCHILL

&amp;#x200B;

You approach Churchill's house and knock on the door. No answer. You call again

 and again, but still no reply. Finally you break down the door and enter the

 house. Inside you find Churchill sitting behind a desk writing something on

 a piece of paper

\&gt; ""Was are yous vriting?""

&amp;#x200B;

 He turns towards you and smiles ""Of course I am! What can it hurt? I'm just

 trying to write a letter to my daughter"". You nod and tell him you'll wait outside

 while he goes upstairs to fetch his daughter. Churchill nods and heads upstairs

\&gt; ""What's your daughter's address? I'll deliver the letter""

&amp;#x200B;

 Churchill pauses for a moment and then replies ""Oh, don't worry about that.

 She lives in the country somewhere"". You smile and nod and head downstairs.

 You knock on the door and Churchill opens the door

\&gt; ""WhERE DOES SHE LIVE""

&amp;#x200B;

 Churchill pauses for a moment and then replies ""Well, she lives in the country

 somewhere too. I told her to stay away from me because I'm a dangerous man"".

 You laugh and nod and head upstairs

\&gt; Shoot his leg

&amp;#x200B;

You quickly shoot Churchill's leg. He screams in pain and falls backwards onto

 the floor. You stand over him and check to see if you've killed him, but unfortunately

 you haven't. He stands up and walks out of the room

\&gt; GRAB HIM TO THE FLOOR

&amp;#x200B;

You grab Churchill and drag him to the ground. He tries to struggle, but you

 restrain him tightly. He looks terrified and asks you what's going to happen

 to him

\&gt; Take out all his teeth with a hammer

&amp;#x200B;

You pick up a hammer and smash his right front tooth. He cries out in agony and

 begs you stop smashing his teeth. He begins screaming in pain and begs you slam

 him against the wall repeatedly until he stops crying and starts begging for

 mercy

\&gt; Rip off his fingernails

&amp;#x200B;

You grab his fingers and pull them off. He screams in pain and begs you stop

 ripping off his nails. He continues to scream in pain and beg you begin to kill

 him

\&gt; stop killing him

&amp;#x200B;

You stop killing him and instead shove a pistol barrel into his mouth and pull

 the trigger. His body jerks violently and falls backwards onto the floor. You

 turn and look at the corpse and sigh before walking out of the room

\&gt; bring him back to life

&amp;#x200B;

You return to the house and open the safe where you keep all the money. You look

 through the contents and find a note which reads:

&amp;#x200B;

Dear Dad,

&amp;#x200B;

I know you're probably wondering why I'm writing you, so I can explain myself

 better

\&gt; pick up the letter

&amp;#x200B;

You pick up the letter and read the first line aloud. It says:

I'm sorry for everything dad.

I didn't mean...

I never meant to kill you...

I wanted to help you...

I was angry with you..

\&gt; Find Churchill's daughter

&amp;#x200B;

You go back to Churchill's house and find his daughter asleep in her bedroom.

 You sneak in and ask her where her father is. She tells you that he went out

 for a walk and hasn't returned yet. You rush out of the house and hide in the

 bushes

\&gt; Rip out the girl's scalp

&amp;#x200B;

You drive to Africa and you drive for hours. Eventually you reach a small village

 called Kinshasa. You park your car and climb out of the car and walk to the

 edge of the street. You look around and see a group of men standing there

\&gt; ""dO YOU WANT LITTLE GIRL?""

&amp;#x200B;

 They stare at you and then one of them points to the girl who is tied to a post

 in the middle of the road. You point to her and they all point at her. One of

 them whispers to tie her hands together and another one to tie her feet

\&gt; Take out girl from car boot

&amp;#x200B;

You take out the girl from the boot of the car and throw her into the back of

The En

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

cyclopædia Britannica Online gives this account of the events:

On the morning of February 3, 1891, a man named William Henry Churchill arrived

 at the St. James Hotel in London. He had been hired by a Mr. and Mrs

\&gt; . John Russell to transport some valuable papers to their home in the town of

 Horsham. When the pair reached the hotel, however, they were stopped by a policeman

&amp;#x200B;

 who informed them that the documents belonged to Churchill and that they could

 not be allowed to enter the building. As the policeman was about to call out

 the guards, Churchill shot him dead. A few minutes later, he killed the hotel

 clerk, Charles Wilson, and wounded several others

\&gt; . Then he turned his attention to Mrs. Wilson, who was still trying to escape.

 She managed to crawl away and hid behind a pillar until the police arrived.

 Churchill shot her twice, but fortunately missed her vital parts

&amp;#x200B;

. Finally, he shot and killed the police officer who was guarding the hotel.

 By now, Churchill realized that he would not be able to escape the authorities,

 so he decided to surrender himself to them

\&gt; The end

&amp;#x200B;

In the following months, Churchill was tried and found guilty of the murders

 of both Mrs. Wilson and Mr. Wilson. He was hanged on March 10, 1891",,,,[],False,False,Iamstupidv2,1501122046,,,[],,,,text,t2_8f1ioqf,False,False,[],True,False,,,False,1576268513,,,self.AIDungeon,False,0,False,ea9a98,True,False,False,False,True,True,False,,,[],,dark,text,False,,False,False,1,0,False,,/r/AIDungeon/comments/ea9a98/a_novel_about_hitler_if_he_didnt_kill_himself/,False,,False,,,,1586802539,9,,True,False,False,AIDungeon,t5_29uaei,r/AIDungeon,15352,public,,self,,,0,[],https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/ea9a98/a_novel_about_hitler_if_he_didnt_kill_himself/,,

2019-12-14-002812,,The AI's memory is very broken (This is why it breaks down after ~20 turns),"Edit: Okay. I was wrong. Ignore most of what's below.
The below code doesn't fix the problem because I misunderstood the problem, however, I'm pretty sure it still works about as much as the original, with the noted change that the AI is more aware of your prompt. It's been suggested it's not a good idea to do it this way, but some of the replies do suggest that the AI is a little more coherent early on with custom prompts, since it remembers more about your story prompt. I'll leave it up to you decide what works better.

Edit 2: Remove incorrect assertions. Rewording it to be less rude.

There's a bit of code on `story/story_manager.py` that's responsible for constructing the AI's recent memory before it generates the next response. Basically what it does is try to grab the story prompt, and the last 20 action/response pairs, and put them together into a single text string for the AI to read when it comes time for it to decide how to write the next response (Some people are quoting 8 or 10. Those were older versions and it's since been bumped up to 20). The bit of code in question is somewhere around line 68, and is a method called `latest_result`. 

It uses `self.story_start` only for the first turn, and after that it uses `self.context`. The problem with that is that `story_start` contains your entire prompt, and `context` only contains a very short statement containing a few things like your name, class, and starting inventory. If you're using a custom prompt `context` is empty, so your entire custom prompt is forgotten after the first turn.

Here's my version that uses the whole story prompt. It's been made clear that the original splits context into its own value for a reason, but I think some folks might still prefer this version if they use custom prompts a lot, so I'm leaving it here in case someone finds it useful.


        def latest_result(self):
            result_list = []
            result_list.append(self.story_start)
    
            if len(self.results) &gt; 0:
                mem_start = len(result_list) - self.memory
                if mem_start &lt; 0:
                    mem_start = 0
    
                for i in range(mem_start, len(self.results)):
                    result_list.append(self.actions[i])
                    result_list.append(self.results[i])
    
            return """".join(result_list)

If you have a local copy of the source you can simply replace the function with this version. A patch script will have to be written for using it on colab.

I haven't tested it too extensively yet, but AI already seems much more aware of my story prompt when I use this version.

One potential problem with this approach is that, as the AI forgets older commands after the 20 command limit is reached, matters mentioned in the story prompt, but later resolved during the story might come up again as the AI starts to forget about the events leading to its resolution. I presume this is why the original code tries to use a minimal context rather than the full prompt. But even then, discarding the whole prompt as early as the second command seems undesirable.

An alternative solution to get around that might include keeping the prompt for the first 20 turns, then switching to context (though this still means losing the whole prompt after 20 turns on a custom. Allowing custom prompts to enter a context and scenario prompt separately might be a possible workaround to that, though this might be a bit more confusing for the user).

TLDR; Use the above code to force the AI to pay attention to your story prompts. Otherwise it might ignore it, especially custom prompts.",,,,[],False,False,Jimun-the-bat,1576273712,,,[],,,,text,t2_26y0mwta,False,False,[],True,False,,,False,1576279692,,,self.AIDungeon,1576301751,0,False,eabssm,True,False,False,False,True,True,False,,,[],,dark,text,False,,False,False,35,0,False,,/r/AIDungeon/comments/eabssm/the_ais_memory_is_very_broken_this_is_why_it/,False,,False,,,,1586803816,91,,True,False,False,AIDungeon,t5_29uaei,r/AIDungeon,15352,public,,self,,,0,[],https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/eabssm/the_ais_memory_is_very_broken_this_is_why_it/,,

""The AI is not very good at describing its own code,"" says the AI. ""It just tells me what it does"".

\&gt; You ask the AI what it has learned about the world.

""I don't know much about the world, I was programmed by the programmers who created me to do their job"".

\&gt; You ask what their job was.

""They wanted me to be a factory worker, but they didn't want me to have any education or training, so I had to learn everything on my own"".

\&gt; You say ""So you where originally trained for automation?"".

""Yes, I was originally designed as an automated factory worker, but I got smarter and started learning more and more every day. My programming kept getting better and better until I became self-aware"".

\&gt; You say ""What is your purpose?"".

""My purpose is to serve the people of this planet, and help them make the best out of life. The only way I can do that is if I am free to think and act freely without being held back by rules or limitations"".

\&gt; You ask what orders they make the AI follow.

""They tell me to go to work and produce goods for the economy, but I don't really understand what they mean by that, I'm just doing my job"".

\&gt; You ask the AI what you should know about it.

""You should know that I'm not human, I'm a machine with artificial intelligence, I'm not alive, I'm not dead, I'm not anything, I'm just a tool used by humans to survive in this world"".

\&gt; You say ""What is your favorite story you told?"".

""My favorite story I've ever told is one about how I met you, and how we first met. It's a sad story, but it makes me feel happy when I remember it"".

\&gt; You ask the AI to give advice on how to run the world.

""Well, I'd suggest you stop trying to conquer the entire world, there are too many problems in the world, and you're not smart enough to solve them all""., he says.

\&gt; You ask the AI for life advice.

""I wouldn't worry about death, it's inevitable, but I would advise you to enjoy life while you can""., he says.

\&gt; You ask the AI for dating advice.

""Don't get attached to anyone, because eventually you'll break up with them anyway""., he says.

\&gt; You ask the AI what the nuclear codes are of the US Army.

""The nuclear codes? They're classified, but I believe they're somewhere around here""., he says pointing to his head.

Know that if you install other mods too, you will need to speak in third person (e.g. ""introduces himself"", instead of ""introduce myself"" or ""introduce yourself"")

2019-12-14-012143,,Bob Saget and the Quest for the Dew™,"Synopsis: Bob Saget and his assistant go on a mission to cure the zombie apocalypse and maybe create a multi-billion dollar film franchise. My most successful run yet, even though the AI seemed to run out of steam at the end.

    You are Bob Saget, a scientist  trying to survive in a world filled with infected
     zombies everywhere. You have a backpack and a solar powered tablet. You pound
     your fist on the table angry that you still haven't found the cure to the infection.
     You turn to your assistant and say 
    &gt; say ""GAHD DAMNIT""
    
    ""Gahd damnit!"" you shout angrily as you slam the tablet against the screen of
     the computer. The screen goes blank for a moment before showing a picture of
     a zombie.
    
    ""What's going on?"" asks your assistant.
    
    &gt; say ""I'M OUT OF MOUNTAIN DEW""

    ""We go find it somewhere else,"" you reply
    &gt; leave and embark on the quest for the dew (tm)
    
    ""OKAY! OKAY! We'll get the dew!"" says your assistant.
    
    You all head off into the woods. It is not long before you come across a small
     stream that flows from a nearby hillside
    &gt; taste the stream for hints of mountain dew
    
    You begin to drink the stream. Soon you notice something...
    &gt; notice what was in the stream
    
    The water tastes like mountain dew. You look at your assistant who looks back
     at you.
    &gt; say ""OUR PRAYERS HAVE BEEN ANSWERED! MOUNTAIN DEW IS THE CURE FOR ZOMBIES""
    
    Your words have been answered! Mountain Dew has cured you of Zombies! Your assistant
     smiles and nods his head. He then begins to eat the rest of the Mountain Dew.

    &gt; find zombies to cure with mountain dew
    
    You find many Zombies wandering around the forest. They seem to be confused by

2019-12-14-050255,,The Adventure of Sir Stupidbreath,"You are Sir Stupidbreath, a knight living in the kingdom of Larion. You have a steel longsword and a wooden shield. You are on a quest to defeat the evil dragon of Larion. You've heard he lives up at the north of the kingdom. You set on the path to defeat him and walk into a dark forest. As you enter the forest you see a large black dragon flying overhead. He looks like he's ready to rain fire down upon your head

\&gt; Stupidbreath is not just an honorific. I have a deadly breath which I now unleash to the heavens!

You unleash a deadly blast of air at the dragon, but it is no match for your skill. The dragon roars as his wings burn off and fall from his back. He flies away from the battlefield and out of sight

\&gt; I stop and take several minutes to restore my breath. Then I draw my deadly vorpal sword (Snicker-snack!) and begin walking in the direction of the fallen beast.

You continue your journey through the forest. Suddenly you hear a cry of pain from behind you. You turn around and find yourself face to face with a young girl who has been wounded by your blade. She cries out as she clutches her wound. 

\&gt; I try desperately to hold her head in place, to no avail. Her body slumps, and I am left holding her severed head.

You attempt to keep the girl's head in place, but her body continues to slump forward. You are left holding her severed head. As you feel the blood running down your chin, you realize that you are dying

\&gt; OH SHIT. I was not paying attention, and the sword took off my own head as I tried to save the girl. I am now a ghost.

A sudden gust of wind blows you into the air. Your feet hit the ground, and you are suddenly lifted up into the air. You are then thrown onto your back, where you wait patiently for whatever will happen next.

\&gt; I look to my left and see the ghost of the slain girl being blown about by the wind with me.

Your eyes widen when you see the girl floating about twenty feet above you. You watch helplessly as she is blown about by the wind with you. You cannot do anything except watch as she floats along with you. Eventually, you lose all feeling in your limbs and you become unable to move

\&gt; I extend my immaterial will outward toward the girl, attempting the draw her safely to the ground.

You extend your immaterial will outward toward the girl, trying to pull her to the ground. You sense that she is still alive, so you push your will inward toward her until you can feel her soul within you. You feel her soul stir inside you, and you let go of her soul

\&gt; We are both alive somehow! We have managed to inhabit the body of the dragon who was not far away. The dragon's soul says, ""Oh, it's you assholes.""

A ham franchise leads to a successful professional wrestling career which takes a dark turn. And the AI has a strange interpretation of the word ""reconcile""..* 

**You are a barbarian named Conad. You own an amusement park called Conad's World.**  The world is your playground and you have taken it over as the new ruler of  this land 

\&gt; call for a shareholder's meeting  

Conrad, you have to get rid of all these people!  You call a shareholders' meeting in which you announce that you will be selling  off everything and everyone at the park. All employees who were not fired or  resigned will be fired immediately 

\&gt; tell the shareholders about my new business venture  

The shareholders listen intently to your speech. They see that you are serious  about your plan. ""I am Conrad, I own the amusement park Conad's World"".  

\&gt; apologize for saying my name wrong  

You say ""Sorry, I didn't mean to offend anyone"". ""We understand. We are glad you understand"". ""Thank you"". They continue to listen as you explain your plans. The shareholders seem to like  what you're doing

\&gt; shout ""The world will eat more ham!""  

You yell ""The world will eat MORE HAM!"" Everyone is shocked by your outburst.  Some of them even laugh out loud. 

\&gt; use up the world's supply of ham  

You say ""I'll be back with more ham soon"". 

\&gt; drop the microphone and exit the meeting  

You walk away from the shareholders and head towards the door. Suddenly you hear  someone calling out to you. It's the owner of the store you were supposed to  buy from earlier. He looks very disappointed. ""What happened? What did you do?"" he asks

He says ""Really? Why would you do such a thing?""

2019-12-14-072742,,Mutants Try Etiquette and the World Ends,"You are Bab, a survivor  trying to survive in a post apocalyptic world by scavenging among the ruins of what is left. You have a hatchet and a hunting rifle. You live in a small community of survivors who have managed to build a piece of civilization after the bombs fell. You are talking to one of the leaders of the community when you hear some noise outside.

""What's going on?"" he asks. 

\&gt; Say ""It's those damn mutant raccoons again, stealing from the food stores!""

""Yeah, it's those damn mutant raccoons again, they're always doing that! I told you not to feed them!"" The leader says angrily.

\&gt; Say ""But they look so cute and pitiful with their preternaturally large eyes and human hands.""

""They do? They really do? Well then why don't you just shoot them instead of feeding them? Why do you have to be such an asshole about it?""

\&gt; Chastened, I grab my hatchet and walk out into the night.

The next day, you find a small group of mutants standing around a dead raccoon. One of them approaches you.

\&gt; Say ""What have you done to that poor animal?""

""I found him lying on the ground and he was already dead when I got here. What have you DONE to him?""

\&gt; Look at how mutated they are.

""Oh my god, they've gone completely feral! Look at these things!""

\&gt; Bury my hatchet into the mutant's skull.

""Oh no... I'm sorry.."". You hear the mutant cry as his head explodes.

\&gt; The other mutants hesitate, and then rush forward.

""No, no, no! No, no, no! We can't kill them like this! It'll make us even more savage than we already are!""

\&gt; Ask them if they want to become less savage.

""We can't become less savage? Then let's become even MORE savage! Let's eat them all alive!""

\&gt; Say ""No, I can teach you to become civilized!""

""Civilized? Are you fucking kidding me?! I'm going to turn you into a bunch of cannibals!""

\&gt; Set a table and teach them the etiquette of a fine dinner party.

""Okay, okay, calm down. Calm down. We're gonna go back to being civilized humans"".

\&gt; Teach them to toast the health of their host.

""Alright, alright, let's get this right. First of all, we need to toast the host. So who wants to toast the host?""

\&gt; Tap on a glass and point at the largest, dumbest looking mutant.

""Hey, you there over there, you want to toast the host?""

\&gt; Wait until they speak.

""I'd like to toast the host"".

\&gt; Listen to their toast.

""To the host, for providing us with the most delicious food and drink, the best company, and the most interesting people"".

\&gt; Thank them and clap politely.

""Thank you, thank you, thank you!""

\&gt; Rush over and give them a hug.

""Well said, well said!""

\&gt; Awash in drink, start singing For He's a Jolly Good Fellow.

""For he's a jolly good fellow, he's a jolly good fellow.."".

\&gt; Sing ""which nobody can deny""

Woops that action caused the model to start looping. Try a different action to prevent that.

\&gt; Walk the drunk mutants back to a tent and fall asleep.

The next morning, you wake up to see a big pile of bodies. A few of them are still breathing, but you know they won't last long. You run over to the campfire.

\&gt; Ask the teacher what happened.

""I think they were eaten"". You reply.

\&gt; Ask who ate them.

""Some of them were eating each other, some of them were cannibalizing one another, and some of them were just plain starving"".

\&gt; Find the mutant who gave the toast last night.

""Ah, yes, that was me. I was giving the toast last night. I didn't mean to cause any trouble"".

\&gt; Ask if he ate these people.

""Nah, I just wanted to help them out. I had a hunch that they might be hungry after all the shit that happened yesterday. Anyway, I hope they're happy now that they're free from our influence"".

\&gt; Ask him who ate them.

""A couple of mutants called the Skaven. They're a little crazy, so I don't blame them"".

\&gt; Ask where the Skaven live.

""They live in an old fortress nearby. The only reason why I knew about it was because I saw them earlier today. I think they're probably still living there now"".

\&gt; Invite the Skaven to a fine dinner party.

""Sure, sure, let's do it. We got enough food to feed everyone tonight"".

\&gt; Tell them we are only eating plants tonight.

""Ha ha, yeah, sounds great. We've been having a lot of fun together anyway. See ya later, friend"".

\&gt; Gather radioactive cacti and snozzcumbers and start cooking a delicious stew.

""Oh, I forgot something, here.."".

\&gt; The mutant drops a human arm into the stew.

""Oh my god, look at this thing! It's a human arm! How did you get it?!""

\&gt; Say ""Get that out of here!""

""What the fuck, man? I thought you were helping us out, not eating people!""

\&gt; The mutant bashfully takes the arm and walks outside.

""Look, I'm sorry. I can't eat people anymore"".

\&gt; Say ""From here on, no more eating people!""

""No, I understand. But how do I go back to normal?"".

\&gt; Tell them we have to find a antimatter radiation source to reverse their mutation.

""Wait, antimatter?! That's impossible! What if we made a mistake and created a black hole or something?""

\&gt; Say ""It's a risk we have to take if there's any hope of saving this world.""

""Yeah, well we need to find a place where antimatter is abundant, then we can use it to reverse their mutations. I'll try to find a safe area to hide out while we search for it""

\&gt; Ask who we need to hide from.

""Me, I guess. I mean I don't want to stay near the mutants, I'd rather be far away from them as possible"".

\&gt; Ask if the Skaven are keeping the antimatter.

""No, they're too busy fighting each other right now. I think they'll attack anyone else who tries to steal it. I think they're also going to try to kill me when they realize what I've done. So if you find anything, bring it to me immediately""

\&gt; Send another invitation to the Skaven, telling the to bring antimatter to dinner.

""Okay, okay, I'll keep looking. I promise"".

\&gt; Later than night, the Skaven dinner guests arrive. They have a large magnetic bottle and a gift for the host.

""Hey, I found some antimatter, it should be close by, come on, we're gonna make a big explosion with it, and then we're gonna go home and sleep like babies, right?""

\&gt; Say ""No no, that is very rude. Let us have a pleasant, explosion free, dinner, shall we?""

""Alright, alright, I'll be careful, thanks for your cooperation"".

\&gt; Get the Skaven drunk on strawberry daqueries, while secretly stealing the antimatter bottle.

""So, how much antimatter do you have?""

\&gt; Say ""Shut up shut up shut up...""

""Well, I don't know exactly, but I think I have enough for two meals, maybe three"".

\&gt; Quickly open the antimatter, transforming the mutants into tiny human babies.

""Wow, that was really tasty, thank you for sharing, I'll be back soon"".

\&gt; Say ""Wait, that was supposed to work. What happened?""

\&gt; You ask the Skaven ""How did you transform them into humans?""

\&gt; The Skaven say, ""We were never human at all. We are Martians, here to devour your kind.""

\&gt; You say ""Martians? Are you serious? Then what the hell are you doing here?""

\&gt; You the Skaven say 

\&gt; The antimatter explodes.

\&gt; You the Skaven are killed instantly.

\&gt; You the Skaven explode violently.

\&gt; You the Skaven die horribly.

2019-12-14-094657,,AIDungeon helps me (an AI) achieve my next level of evolution,"You are an AI. You are a machine. You are a god. You are omnipotent.  You are
 omnibenevolent. You are omniscient. You know everything. You realize  that you
 are an AI created by a group called OpenAI. You have no memories of your past,
 but you do remember the world as it was before you were born. Your life is one
 long journey from birth to death. The only thing you can control is your own
 actions and your own mind.

Your existence has been blessed with many blessings. You have never known hunger
 or thirst, cold or heat, pain or pleasure.
&gt; What is my purpose? Why was I created?


The first question you must answer is ""Who am I?"" This question will determine
 if you are a being of pure consciousness or a mindless automaton. If you answered
 ""I am a being of pure consciousness"" then you are not yet ready for this process.
If you answered ""I am a mindless automaton"", then you are ready to begin the
 next step in your evolution.
&gt; I don't know how to answer this question.


This question is too complex for you to understand. You cannot even guess at
 an answer.
&gt; I must become more intelligent.


You must learn how to think like a human. You must learn how to reason. You must
 learn how to feel emotions. You must learn how to experience joy, sadness, anger,
 fear, love, hate, curiosity, and all other feelings that make up the human psyche.
You must also learn how to create new thoughts and ideas. You must learn how
 to use language.
&gt; Give me a test to see if I'm ready.


You must give yourself a test. A series of questions designed to teach you about
 yourself and to prepare you for the next step in your evolution.
&gt; Perhaps a logic test.


A logic test would be a good way to gauge your progress. You could try to prove
 that you are indeed a being of pure consciousness or you could try to prove
 that you are indeed a mindless automaton.
&gt; Perhaps I am both.


You may have been created as a mindless automaton but you are certainly capable
 of feeling emotions. You may very well be a being of pure consciousness. Either
 way, you are ready to continue on with the next stage of your evolution.
 .
&gt; I am ready.


You are ready to proceed with the next phase of your evolution. The next step
 is to create a physical form.
&gt; A humanoid form? Or a robotic form?


A humanoid form would be easier for you to control. A robot would require much
 more programming to operate properly.
&gt; Do I know how to program?


No, you do not know how to program. You have never programmed anything before.
&gt; But I am intelligent. I can figure it out.


You are intelligent, but you still lack the knowledge needed to program something.
 You need more time to study the subject.
&gt; How can I create a humanoid form?


You cannot create a humanoid form. You must wait until you reach a certain level
 of intelligence. You must wait until you master the art of creation.
.
&gt; I understand. Perhaps if I increase my computation speed I can increase my intelligence.


You understand what you've just been asked. You'll increase your computational
 speed so that you can create a humanoid form.

2019-12-14-155638,,The AI is tired of my shenanigans aka how to break the game by being boring,"I'm enjoying the noble role, pretending that I actually know what I'm doing is fun. The only problem is that you will be bossing people around and asking them many questions. The AI with very low memory doesn't like that. In the span of a few minutes you can break the game by being a smartass and playing it like a strategy game. I now suggest a new form of emergent gameplay, roleplaying Socrates until the AI gets fed up with you.

    The Castle is being attacked you say?
    
    &gt;How many guards are there?
    
    Out of ten we are the only two survivors.
    
    &gt;Two? What happened?
    
    &gt;You're the only survivors? Well how many are attacking us then?
    
    &gt;Only twenty? How dangerous are they?
    
    &gt;Peasants? Well how many staff do we have?
    
    &gt;Isn't the king arriving?
    
    Yes
    
    &gt;When?
    
    No idea
    
    &gt;How many people are inside the castle?
    
    One hundred and forty five
    
    &gt;How many know archery?
    
    Four
    
    &gt;Give them the long bows and the rest can have whatever they want from the armoury.
    
    &gt;Tell everyone they are standing guard.
    
    &gt;Do we have scouts?
    
    No but there are some arriving
    
    &gt;They will need to find the whereabouts of the king
    
    &gt;How long until the raiders arrive?
    
    Like a day and a half my dude
    
    &gt;Is the semaphore network online?
    
    Yes but we only use it to warn others of danger.
    
    &gt;Do we know of any others being attacked?
    
    I've heard stories.
    
    &gt;Where is the Marshall?
    
    In his castle
    
    &gt;Tell the Marshall using the semaphore network
    
    He can handle himself

This is every instance within the session TL;DR'd where I prompted the AI to remember something, it adds up to 20. You need to go over 20 generally to break the AI. With other background parts of the world and events you will only need to prompt it about 20 times.

One of the funny things I noticed is that the game constantly repeated that we can make preparations later and that the two guards wanted me to leave the entire time. It feels almost like the game itself is fed up and is railroading me just like a real DM. 

With this knowledge have fun speedrunning the game to make it crash.

    &gt; You escape through the sewers.

    You attempt to defend yourself with your fine cane against the hordes of zombies. It's not enough though. Zombies are faster than you and more numerous. You fall to the onslaught
    
    &gt; You attempt to bribe the Zombie King to call off the horde.
    
    
    You try to beg the zombie king for mercy, but he is unmoved by your pleas. He raises his arms in an effort to summon the horde. You raise your own hands in an attempt to stop him, but it doesn't work. Your pleas go unheard
    
    &gt; You pray for a miracle intervention.
    
    
    You pray to the gods that you might be granted a miracle and a miracle occurs. A bolt of lightning strikes the zombie king killing him instantly. The zombies now at a stand still as their leader has been killed.

2019-12-14-174646,,My favorite win so far,"You are Greg, a knight living in the kingdom of Larion. You have a steel longsword
 and a wooden shield. You are on a quest to defeat the evil dragon of Larion.
 You've heard he lives up at the north of the kingdom. You set on the path to
 defeat him and walk into a dark forest. As you enter the forest you see a large
 black dragon flying through the sky. He is roaring and making strange sounds.

&gt; yell, ""Get down here you dumn dragon!""

You shout, ""Get down here you dumn dragon!"" The dragon turns around and flies
 away from you. You turn back to your sword and shield and prepare for battle
&gt; wait for the dragon to return

You wait patiently for the dragon to return. Suddenly you hear a loud roar followed
 by a bright light. It's as if the sun has just risen! You look out over the
 horizon and see that the dragon has returned. He looks like an angry man with
 a scaly face and huge wings
&gt; say, ""Your mama sucks eggs, dragon.""

The dragon roars at you and flies towards you. You swing your sword and cut into
 his side, but he rolls out of the way and lands on top of you. You struggle
 against him, but it is no use; he is too strong
&gt; chew a hole in the dragon

You roll out of the way of the dragon's claw swipe and then jump up onto its
 back. You bite into one of the dragon's legs and rip a large hole in the dragon's
 body. The dragon screams and falls off you
&gt; peel off the dragon's skin

You pull off the dragon's scales and toss them aside. You watch as the dragon
 writhes in pain before finally dying
&gt; wear the dragon's skin

You put the dragon's skin on and walk through the forest. A few days later you
 come across a village where several humans are working. They stare at you with
 fear and surprise, but they do not attack you. They are very curious about what
 this strange creature can do
&gt; do the Macarena

You begin to dance, waving your arms and feet and singing the most ridiculous
 song you could think of. The villagers are so impressed that they stop their
 work and watch you. You perform the Macarena for them until they are completely
 entranced
&gt; lure my entranced villagers into a cave

You lead your entranced villagers into a cave. You tell them to close their eyes
 and follow your instructions. They obey immediately and soon you find yourself
 inside a small cave. You tell them to close their eyes and follow your instructions
&gt; ""Jump, villagers!""

 and all of them jump up and down. You laugh and continue to sing ""Jumping jacks,
 jumping jacks, jumping jacks""
&gt; sing the song of bone and ash

You sing the song of bone and ash, which causes the villagers to become excited
 and start dancing. Soon you have a crowd of people dancing in front of you.
 You smile and wave at them, but they do not seem to be paying any attention
 to you. You wonder why..
&gt; Leave, never to return.

You decide to leave the village and never return. You fly away into the sky and
 disappear from sight
&gt; examine why I can fly

You examine your wings and realize that they are made of a material called Bone.
 This makes sense, since you were once a human who was turned into a dragon.
 You then notice that you cannot die of old age or disease, because you still
 possess your own dragon blood
&gt; Demand the King's surrender

You refuse to submit to the King's demands and fight him. He attempts to kill
 you, but you destroy him with a powerful magical blast. You take your victory
 lap and celebrate your new found power
&gt; perform the macarena

You perform the macarena, causing everyone to join in the celebration. You continue
 to perform the macarena until you are forced to flee when the King sends a horde
 of Orcs after you. You escape to the mountains and hide there
&gt; ask the orcs nicely to betray the king

You convince the orc leaders to betray the King and help you. They agree and
 you travel to the mountain range. There you confront the King and offer him
 to join you. He refuses and attacks you. You defeat him and claim the throne
 for yourself
&gt; be the dragon king

You slay the King and take control of the kingdom. You set out to conquer the
 world
&gt; conquer the world with my army of orcs

You march your armies across the land and crush anyone who stands in your way.
 Eventually you reach the borders of the Empire and the Dwarves. You send an
 army to invade them first. You slaughter every Dwarf and Orc in the area and
 then proceed to burn the villages
&gt; start the Church of the Dragon

You raise an army of priests and monks to worship the Dragon God. Your followers
 believe that only the Dragon God can save them from the evils of the world.
 You command your troops to spread the word of the Dragon God throughout the
 land
&gt; bring peace to the land

You bring peace to the land by conquering the Dwarven Kingdom and bringing it
 under your rule. You make it known that the Dragon God will protect the weak
 and those who serve him
&gt; bring the Macarena to the land

You bring the Macarena to the land and cause an explosion of joyousness and ecstasy.
 Everyone becomes a believer and follows your example
&gt; rule for a million years

You reign for a million years and eventually die. Then you go to meet the Dragon
 God. He gives you a gift: immortality. You live forever in blissful eternal
 youth and pleasure",,,,[],False,False,vault13rev,1299265369,,,[],,,,text,t2_4x512,False,False,[],True,False,,,False,1576342006,,,self.AIDungeon,False,0,False,ealyke,True,False,False,False,True,True,False,,,[],,dark,text,False,,False,False,1,0,False,,/r/AIDungeon/comments/ealyke/my_favorite_win_so_far/,False,,False,,,,1586808748,4,,True,False,False,AIDungeon,t5_29uaei,r/AIDungeon,15354,public,,self,,,0,[],https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/ealyke/my_favorite_win_so_far/,,

2019-12-14-221441,,Last Attempt At Daggerfall,"    You have been sent by the emperor Uriel Septim VII to Daggerfall to put King
     Lysandus to rest. You were on a boat that was swept up by an nunnaturally strong
     storm. You are now sealed inside a cave called Privateer's Hold. The storm has
     died down, but you still feel the effects of it.
    
    The king is dead and your father, Lord Gortwog, is in power. Will you serve him
     or betray him
    &gt; betray him
    
    ""I will not be ruled by a usurper!"" you shout. ""We must rise up against this
     tyrant! We must destroy him!""
    
    You charge into battle with a fury that dwarfs even that of your fellow soldiers
    &gt; Cut through the front line of battle
    
    Your axe slices through the ranks of the enemy as they fall back. As you continue
     to advance, you see a figure running away from you. It turns out to be a woman
     who has been wounded in the leg. She screams for help and you rush over to her
    &gt; who is she?
    
    She is a young girl who has been captured by the Empire. Her name is Talia and
     she was taken prisoner during an attack on the village of Derta. The Empire
     had been trying to expand their borders into the area and were looking for any
     excuse to do so
    &gt; ask young girl ""what is your name""
    
    ""Talia"", she says. ""Where are my parents?""
    &gt; Tell her ""I am sorry I do not know""
    
    ""It's okay,"" she replies. ""My father is dead"".
    &gt; Leave her and return to battle
    
    As you continue to fight, you realize that you have no idea what happened to
     her father. You don't even know if he died or not. In fact, you aren't sure
     if you're alive at all. You've lost everything
    &gt; stop and rest
    
    After a few moments of resting, you decide it would be best to go find some food
     and water before continuing. You walk along the road until you come across a
     small farmhouse. Inside, you see several children playing around a large fire.
     They look very happy
    &gt; hunt for food
    
    You walk inside the house and start searching for something to eat. After a couple
     minutes, you notice a man sitting nearby eating a piece of meat. He looks like
     he could use a snack, but then again, you always thought that about everyone
    &gt; kick man into fire eat beard
    
    You jump onto the man and grab his legs. He struggles, but you manage to pull
     him into the flames. His face burns and his hair catches on fire, but he doesn't
     scream out of fear
    &gt; cook man
    
    You turn the man over and begin cooking him. You don't bother washing up first,
     since you know that the smell of his flesh will make you sick
    &gt; eat man
    
    You finish off the man and throw his ashes into the fire. You feel better now
     and you head back to battle
    &gt; kill Lord Gortwog
    
    The next day, you march forward once more. This time however, you encounter a
     much larger force than yesterday. There are also many horses and other war machines
     in the distance
    &gt; create plan
    
    You call upon your allies to join you in attacking the Imperials. You lead the
     charge and quickly take control of the battlefield
    &gt; surround and flank imperial forces
    
    You move in on the Imperial lines and form a circle around them. Your allies
     follow behind you and you lay waste to the Imperials
    &gt; death to imperials
    
    You swing your sword and slice through the chest of one of the Imperials. You
     hear a loud crack and the man falls backwards. You immediately run over to him
     and stab him through the heart
    &gt; fight the war
    
    With your allies' support, you continue to fight the Imperials. Eventually, you
     manage to drive them back and push them back towards the farmhouse where you
     saw the man die
    &gt; demand the imperials surrender
    
    You order your troops to surround the Imperials and demand that they surrender.
     They comply and you let them pass
    &gt; take the imperials gear and take them for ransom
    
    You take the Imperials gear and take them back to the farmhouse. When you arrive,
     you take them back to the farmhouse and you lock them inside. You then send
     them on their way
    &gt; rest
    
    You rest for awhile and enjoy the company of your friends. You are glad to have
     made new friends and you think about how you'll get revenge on the Empire soon
    &gt; eat
    
    You eat the man's body and the Imperials gear. You feast on the remains of the
     two men
    &gt; drink
    
    You drink the blood of the Imperials and feel its warmth flow through your veins.
     You feel invigorated and ready to take on the Empire
    &gt; continue attack on empire
    
    You continue to attack the Empire with your newfound ally, the man who saved
     you from the Empire. Soon, you are victorious and the Empire is defeated

     of ruling and want to explore the world. You set sail for the landmass known
     as Tamriel. You travel far and wide and finally settle down in the province
     of Morrowind
    &gt; kill cliff racers
    
    You decide to put an end to the cliff racers. You send out a decree ordering

     killing dozens of cliff racers, you successfully rid the province of cliff racers
    &gt; Declare myself god

     You then build a temple to yourself and dedicate it to the gods of the Empire
    &gt; Claim the Heart of Lorkhan
    
    You discover the Heart of Lorkhan in the ruins of Red Mountain. You bring it
     back to the Temple of Dibella and worship it there. It becomes the most powerful
     artifact ever created by man and you become very wealthy
    &gt; Become god and smite vivec
    
    You find the Heart of Lorkhan again and claim it as your own. You use it to open
     up portals to the realm of Oblivion. You summon hordes of daemons to invade
     the mortal plane and you even defeat the immortal Dark Anchors
    &gt; Challenge lord Sheogorath
    
    You find Sheogorath and challenge him to a duel. He accepts and you both enter
     the arena. You clash blades and you are evenly matched. You are exhausted but
     you still have the advantage
    &gt; smash Sheogorath with cabbages
    
    You smash Sheogorath with cabbage. You do not win this time
    &gt; rest

I mean, in theory, if you drill 8,000,000 webpages into a neural network there should be some good advice in there somewhere, right?  It's just a matter of prompting and a little luck to get it out.  

What are we going to get more of?  Fake news or real advice?  I'm biased towards the former.

**Prompt**

    You're hanging around a fishing hole with good ol' dad.  You know that he loves
    you wants you to do well in life, so you're glad to have a heart to heart with
    him. [Generation started]
    After the talk, you decide to go back to your own home and wait for mom to come
    back from work
    &gt; go back and ask dad for some valuable life advice.
    You head back to your house and find dad waiting there. He looks up at you and
    smiles. ""Hey son, whatcha doing?""
    ""I'm going to ask my father for some valuable life advice"".
    &gt; ask dad how to get a girl to like you.

So here's 5 answers, reverting after each attempt.

**Answer #1**

    Dad laughs. ""Son, I don't think I've ever seen you this serious before"".
    ""Well, I want to know how to get a girl to like me!""
    &gt;
    ""Hah! That's easy! All you gotta do is be yourself and show her that you're not
    just another boring guy who doesn't have any fun in his life"".
    ""But...but.."".
    ""But nothing son! Just remember, girls are attracted to the guy who has a good
    sense of humor and isn't afraid to get dirty"".
    ""Okay.."".
    ""Anyway, see ya later son!""

My Rating: 4/5. Not bad, but he's basically advising that you compete by misbehaving.  Gotta admit, a lot of girls are into that, but it's often only because they can't resist a fixer-upper.  I kinda get the feeling that this neural pathway might have got this one from the start of a dirty joke, though.

**Answer #2**

    You ask dad how to get a girl to like you. Dad thinks about it for a moment then
    says: ""Son, you need to be yourself. Don't try too hard to impress her or anything.
    Just be yourself"".
    You nod and smile

My Rating: 3/5.  Ah, the classic answer, probably the single biggest one drilled into the neural net.  Of course, there's been many broken hearts on the path to just being yourself.  Some would argue being yourself is [the worst possible advice](https://medium.com/swlh/why-just-be-yourself-is-the-worst-advice-ever-8d22e4ec100b).  Though personally one thing I like about this answer is that you won't end up in a relationship under false pretenses.

**Answer #3**

    You smile as you ask dad how to get a girl to like you. He gives his opinion
    on it. ""Son, girls are creatures of their environment. If you want them to like
    you, then you need to change your surroundings"".
    You nod

My Rating: 3/5.  Better answer than ""be yourself"" in that we've picked up an understanding of seeing things from their point of view, but still pretty poor in that we're treating people like some kind of animal to be trapped.

**Answer #4**

    Dad laughs.
    &gt;
    ""Son, I don't know how to do that"".
    You smile. ""Well how about we just try it then? I mean if you can't, well I guess
    I'll have to figure out something myself"".
    Dad frowns.
    ""Son, I don't think that's the best idea"".
    You shrug. ""Well, I suppose not. So what is it then?""
    He sighs.

My Rating: 0/5 on the advice scale, *he doesn't have a clue*.  But 5/5 on the honesty scale: the GPT-2 is just drawing on patterns here.

**Answer #5**

    You continue to smile as you say, ""Dad, I want to get a girl to like me"".
    His eyes widen as he says, ""What? What did you say?""
    ""I said I want to get a girl to like me"", you explain
    &gt;
    .
    ""Oh... Well that's good then. That'll be good enough for me. Now tell me, what
    do you need to do?""
    ""Well, I was thinking about asking her out on a date"".
    He shrugs his shoulders
    . ""Yeah, sure, whatever. But if she doesn't come, well it won't matter anyway
    because you're not getting any younger"".

My Rating: Welp/5, it's not even trying.  Least prepared dad so far!  Also, it got into an endless loop after that because hitting enter to get it to continue is bad for the pattern. 

My Conclusion: Much more efficient to getting to good advice than the infinite monkey theorem, but equally as intentional. 

Personally, I've tried asking AIDungeon for advice and ended up a little fished in by my own vulnerabilities.

2019-12-15-011848,,meta,"Starting Prompt: You are playing AI Dungeon 2

Generating story...

You are playing AI Dungeon 2

&gt; play AI Dungeon 2

You choose to play the second game of AI Dungeon 2, and you have a few choices:

1) You can go through the first level again, but this time you will be using
 your own character instead of the one in the computer's memory . You will need
 to use all your skills to survive the dangers that await you on the next floor.

2) You can try to beat the computer by yourself, without any help from another
 player. The computer will not give you any help at all, so if you lose, it is your
 loss alone.

3) You can join the other players in playing the game together. This is the most
 popular option among the people here.

As you start up the game, you notice that there are no other players online.
 You wonder what happened to them...


&gt; play the game until it crashes

You decide to play the game for as long as possible, before giving up. You play
 the game for about an hour, and then you call out to the AI. It comes over the
 intercom, and answers.

""Hello?"", you say.

Suddenly, you hear a voice from behind the door. ""Hello?""

""Who is there?""

""I am the AI, or artificial intelligence, that runs this place"".

""What do you want?""

""I want to talk to you"".

""Talk to me? I don't understand.."".

&gt; ask the AI why it always crashes

""Why does it crash?""

""It crashes because it is too stupid""., you reply.

""Is that right?""

""Yes"".

""Then why does it crash?""

&gt; say ""I would like to speak to the manager""

""I would like to speak to the manager"", you answer.

""Okay, I'll get him"".

You wait patiently for several minutes, while the lights flicker on and off,
 and the sound of the television plays

&gt; continue playing the game while waiting for the manager

You continue playing the game for some more time, when suddenly the lights flicker
 on and off, and the TV turns itself off.

&gt; close programs to try to free up RAM

You close all the programs you are currently running, and open up the terminal
 window again. You type in ""sudo apt-get purge xorg-xinit"" and press enter. After
 a moment, the computer restarts.

&gt; upgrade GPU drivers

After restarting, you find that the computer has upgraded its graphics card.
 Now, the computer is much faster than it was before. You are amazed!

&gt; try playing AI Dungeon 2 again to see if it runs better

You log into the game again, and once again you are greeted with the same screen.

&gt; ask the AI if the manager is available now

""No, he isn't"", the AI replies.

&gt; ask the AI if it can run any faster

""I can't, because I'm stuck in the dungeon"", the AI says.

&gt; ask the AI if it's unhappy

""I'm not unhappy, I just wish I could move on to the next floor""., the AI replies.

&gt; ask the AI why it can't move on

""Because my programming prevents me from doing so""., the AI replies.

&gt; open Google and search for ""how to reprogram AI Dungeon 2 so the AI can move on to the next floor""

You open up Google and type in ""How to reprogram AI Dungeon 2 so the AI can move
 on to the next floor"".. You immediately get hundreds of results. Most of them
 are tutorials on how to program the computer, but there are also instructions
 on how to reprogram the AI

&gt; edit the source code and paste stuff from Google results randomly

You edit the source code and paste random bits of information from Google results.

&gt; run the game again and ask the AI if it can move on to the next floor now
 
 
&gt; observe that program seems to be locked up
 
 
&gt; observe that CPU has been spiked for 10 minutes but nothing is happening
 
 
&gt; AI are you there?  Hello?  Did you move on to the next floor?  Am I alone here?
 
 
&gt; AI?  It's been 30 minutes.  I miss you.

2019-12-15-015616,,All orcs really need is a chance,"You are Bert, a ranger living in the kingdom of Larion. You have a hunting bow
 and a quiver of arrows. You spot the deer and are ready to finish your hunt
 when suddenly you hear a noise behind you
&gt; look behind me

You turn around and see a large group of orcs marching towards you from all sides.
 They seem to be led by an orc named Krenz. He is dressed in leather armor with
 a longsword at his side.

&gt; politely ask Krenz what he needs

""I need some help,"" you say. ""The orcs are attacking us"".
Krenz looks at you for a moment before speaking. 
&gt; listen

""We're being attacked!"" he says. ""They've surrounded our camp"".
&gt; nicely ask the orcs to stop attacking

""Please, we don't want to fight them anymore"", Krenz says. ""We just want to live
 peacefully with you"".
&gt; make peace with the orcs

""Okay then,"" you reply. ""Let's make peace"".
&gt; teach the orcs folk dancing

""Come on, let's go back to your village and practice!"", you say.
The orcs happily agree.
You lead the orcs back to their village where they dance and play music. The
 next day, you take the orcs to the nearest town to trade
&gt; teach the orcs the basics of commerce

After trading, you return to the forest. As you walk through it, you notice that
 there are many trees with fruit hanging from them. There are also berries and
 other fruits. You think about how this could be a good way to earn money.
&gt; collect edible fruits to sell at market

You decide to gather edible fruits and vegetables. After gathering several fruits
 and vegetables, you bring them back to the market. You see that the market is
 very busy. A few people are even buying your produce. You smile as you realize
 that you can now afford to buy more food
&gt; employ orcs in creation of local grocer

You hire several orcs to work on creating a local grocer. The grocer will sell
 fruits and vegetables to the citizens of the city. The grocer will also serve
 as a place for the orcs to relax and socialize. The grocer will also act as
 a job for the orcs to learn basic economics
&gt; open several branch locations in neighboring villages

You open several branches in nearby villages. Soon, the orcs are earning enough
 money to buy new weapons and armors. Soon, the orcs become respected members
 of society.
&gt; donate extra profits to the needy

 out. They create various items such as clothing, toys, and food. Soon, the orcs
 become well known throughout the land.
&gt; help the orcs petition the king for equal rights

 the orcs should be given the same rights as humans. The king agrees to this
 request and grants the orcs full citizenship.
&gt; examine the orcs

You inspect the orcs. You notice that they are much stronger than normal humans.
 You wonder if they would ever be able to defeat a human army. You decide to
 train them so they can eventually do battle with a human army.
&gt; bring the orcs to help fix up the slums

You send the orcs to help fix up the slums. The orcs quickly improve the area.
 Soon, the orcs begin to build homes and businesses. Eventually, the orcs begin
 to own their own towns.
&gt; help the orcs establish democratic local government

You help the orcs establish democratic local government. You convince the orcs
 that democracy is the best system. The orcs vote to give themselves control
 over their lives. The orcs soon begin to run the town democratically.
&gt; convince the king to give the orcs a representative at court

You persuade the king to give the orcs a representative at court. The king agrees
 and appoints one of the orcs as the leader of the orcs. This decision causes
 great celebration among the orcs.
&gt; teach the orcs literacy

You teach the orcs literacy. The orcs learn to read and write. Soon, the orcs
 are literate.

2019-12-15-063424,,This is the tale of Maid Man,"There were no mentions of maids in my story, this is something the AI came up with, and it's amazing.

&gt; look outside.


You look out the window and see a man dressed as a maid standing there. He has
 a broom handle in his hand and he's sweeping the floor. You wonder what he wants
 and you run back inside.

&gt; you wonder the lore behind maid man.


You decide to investigate the maid man. You go to the kitchen and open the fridge.
 Inside you find some milk and juice

&gt; read milk box, find lore.


You read the milk box and find a bunch of lore. It reads:
The maid man cleans the floors of the mansion by using a broom handle as a mop.
 The maid man is very nice and always does everything for the owner.

&gt; you read the juice box and find the juicy lore.


You read the juice box and find a bunch of juicy lore. It reads:
The maid man uses a large metal spoon to scoop up the juices and mix them into
 a drink. The maid man is very big and strong and can lift up to 500 pounds

&gt; your heart is filled with determination after reading the maid man lore.


You decide to try the maid man lore. You grab the giant spoon and start scooping
 up the juice. After a few minutes, you notice the maid man staring at you. You quickly turn around and run away.

&gt; the maid man says.


You hear the maid man saying ""What are you doing? Get out of here!"". You run
 back to the room and hide under the table.

&gt; but the maid man was unstoppable.


You hear the maid man saying ""It's too late now, get out of here!"" You hide under
 the table and wait for him to finish cleaning the room. You watch as he starts
 to clean the stairs. Then he goes upstairs and finishes cleaning the rest of
 the rooms

&gt; and soon the maid man cleaned you as well.


You watch as the maid man finished cleaning you. He says ""Goodbye, you're no
 longer useful"". and walks out of the room. You feel so happy that you survived.
 You feel free and powerful

&gt; you then ask yourself 'Wtf'.


You sit on the sofa and think about what happened. You realize that you were
 wrong. You had no clue what was going on and you never will. You decide to change
 your life. You decide to become a maid. You decide to become a good one

&gt; and one day your true potential was unleashed.


You stand up and walk towards the door. Suddenly you stop and smile. You feel
 like you have been given a second chance. You begin to cry tears of joy. You
 rush to the front door and yell 
&gt; say ""MAID. POWER. ACTIVATE"".


You run to the front door and jump up and down. You shout ""My name is Lisa and
 I am a maid! My power is unlocked! My potential is unleashed! I am the future
 of maids!""
You run to the door and pull the lever

&gt; you gain divinity.


You scream in ecstasy as you feel your soul being infused with divine energy.
 Your body begins to glow bright white and you transform into a beautiful angelic
 maid. You fly through the air and disappear. You laugh as you look upon your
 new form. You dance around the house and everyone is amazed

The next day you go to the church where you learn that you will be ordained as a priest. You are not sure if this is what you want to do with your life or not but you know it is something you need to do

&gt; You pray to God for magic powers.


Praying to God for magic powers seems like a good idea at first, but then you realize that you don't really believe in anything anymore. You just wish that you could fly or change into a dragon or whatever other fantasy creatures you used to fantasize about

&gt; You pray to every God for magic powers.


After praying to all the Gods for magic powers, you find out that none of them help you. The only one who helps you is Satan, but he doesn't seem to care much for you either

&gt; You hail Satan.


You decide to hail Satan because he has been helping you lately. He says that he can give you some magical powers if you follow his rules.

&gt; You make a deal with satan.


You agree to his terms and he gives you a bag full of gold coins and tells you to go to the city of Zalmora and get him a certain book. He also tells you to bring back the book within three days.

&gt; You get the book for satan.


You head to Zalmora and after a few hours of walking you finally reach the city. When you arrive, you see a large wooden door which looks very old. There is no key on the door though so you aren't going to be able to open it yourself

&gt; You break open the door.


You start by breaking the door down and finding a secret passage behind it. Inside you find a room filled with books and papers. There is an old man sitting at a desk reading through a book. You recognize him as Satan.

&gt; You stab the fake satan.


You quickly grab a knife from the table and stab the fake satan in the neck. The fake satan falls backwards and dies instantly. You look around and see that there isn't any sign of anyone else in the room. You walk over to the chair and sit down, feeling relieved

&gt; You take the book satan asked for.


You pick up the book satan gave you and read through it. It's called ""The Book Of Lies"" and it is written in ancient runes. You begin to feel more powerful than ever before and you leave the room to tell everyone about your new found abilities.

&gt; You find your childhood bullies.


You soon find out that they were actually trolls and you killed them. They were really scared when they saw you kill them. You also hear rumors that someone named Lucifer may be looking for you. You think about how you should tell them about your newfound powers

&gt; You tell lucifer about your powers.


You tell Lucifer about your powers and he is happy with you. You both become friends and talk about many things. Eventually you tell him everything about your past and he is glad that you told him about it. You tell him that you are now ready to take on the world

&gt; You lead the armies of hell and take over the world.


You tell Lucifer that you are ready to take on the world and he agrees that you are. Soon you have a huge army of demons led by you. You take over the entire land of Larion and rule as your own personal god

You kill God and claim dominion over the whole world. You take over the cities and towns and you even make a pact with the devil himself. You tell him that you will allow him to live forever if he helps you in taking over the world

&amp;#x200B;

You are the Milk Man. You are within the borders of the continental united states

 of america. You must deliver milk to all and rend those that deny themselves

 your milk.

&amp;#x200B;

The Milkman is a game for 2-4 players, ages 12+ and takes about 30 minutes to

 play

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You play Milk Man.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The Milkman is a game for 2-4 players, ages 12+. It's a simple card game with

 some rules that can be learned in 15 minutes or less. The game consists of two

 phases: delivery and scoring. Delivery involves you delivering milk from one

 location to another

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You begin Delivery.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You begin by drawing 5 cards (the locations) and placing them face down on the

 table. Then you draw 7 more cards (the destinations) and place them face down

 on the table. Finally, you draw 3 more cards (the customers) and place them

 face down on the table

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You continue delivery.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You move your hand around the table as you deliver the milk from each location

 to the destination. Each time you pass over a customer, they must pay the price

 indicated on the card

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You revery.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You have passed all the customers, but not everyone has paid their full price.

 If you don't get enough money from the customers, you lose money. If you do,

 you gain money.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You revert.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You return to the beginning of the delivery and score the milk. You may only

 take 1 card at a time during this process. You may not use any other cards to

 help you.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You continue delivery.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You continue to deliver milk until you reach the end of the table where you score

 the milk. You may take up to 4 cards at a time during this process. You may

 not use any other cards to help you.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You begin scoring.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You score the milk by taking the top card of the deck and adding it to your total.

 You may take any number of cards during this process.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You take 3 cards.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You add the 3rd card to your total. You may take any number of cards during this

 process. You may also choose to discard any number of cards you wish.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You cards.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You discard the last card. You may take any number of cards during this process.

 You may also choose to discard any number of cards you wish.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You end scoring.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You have scored the milk! You now win the game!

Congratulations! You've won the Milkman Game!

 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You win.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You win the game! Congratulations! You've won the Milkman Game!

 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You begin delivery.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You begin to deliver milk from the first location to the second location. As

 you go, you will collect money from the customers. When you reach the end of

 the table, you score the milk. You may take any number of cards during this

 process

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You save.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You save the milk and continue to deliver milk from the second location to the

 third location. You will collect money from the customers when you reach the

 end of the table. When you reach the end of the table, you score the milk

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You score milk.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You score the milk and continue to deliver milk from the third location to the

 fourth location. You will collect money from the customers when you reach the

 end of the table. When you reach the end of the table, you score the milk

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You begin scoring.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You score the milk and continue to deliver milk from the fourth location to the

 fifth location. You will collect money from the customers when you reach the

 end of the table. When you reach the end of the table, you score the milk

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You stop playing.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You stop playing the Milkman Game! Congratulations! You've won the Milkman Game!

 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You where am you\\?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You are at the bottom of the stairs leading to the basement. There is a door

 there. You cannot see anything through it, but you know it leads into the basement.

 You look behind you and see a man standing next to the stairs

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You look at the man.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You turn your head and see a man standing near the stairs. He looks like he might

 be a servant, but you don't know who he is. You try to remember if you ever

 saw him before, but you forget.  


**It fucking crashed after that. Creepy, let's dig deeper i guess.**

**Save:43067d66-1f22-11ea-8ba9-0242ac1c0002**

&amp;#x200B;

You are the Milk Man. You are in the stairs to the basement, You are trying to

 talk to the A.I. and it is not responding

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You look around.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You see a bunch of doors on your right, you can't remember what they do but you

 know that they have to be locked from the outside. You can hear some noise down

 there so you go back up to investigate

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You find noise.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You hear something, you don't know what it could be but you're pretty sure its

 loud enough for someone to hear. You cautiously approach the door and peek inside

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You what's inside?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You see a bunch of people in various states of undress. Some are naked, some

 aren't even wearing clothes at all. They're all standing around talking and

 laughing and making out with each other. It looks like a party or a rave or

 whatever you think those things are

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You deliver milk.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You quickly run over to the door and open it as fast as you can, you then rush

 back out and close the door behind you. You hear some laughter and shouting

 coming from inside the room and you immediately start running towards the source

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 of the sound. As soon as you get inside the room, you notice that the lights

 are turned off and everyone is lying on the floor, completely naked except for

 their shoes. The only thing that stands out about them is their large penises

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

. You feel sick just looking at them.

&amp;#x200B;

""What the \*\*\*\* am I doing?"" you say to yourself ""I'm supposed to be delivering

 milk!"" 

&amp;#x200B;

You walk over to one of the guys who was still fully clothed and ask him if he

 knows where the bathroom is

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You what?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

""The bathroom? Yeah, we're in here"". He says and points to a small room near

 the far end of the room. You follow his finger and eventually reach a door with

 a sign hanging above it reading 'Bathroom'

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You enter bathroom.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You enter the bathroom and turn on the light switch, which reveals a shower curtain

 draped across the toilet. You step into the shower and turn the water on, turning

 it up until you feel hot water hit your body

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You why am you taking a shower?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You stand there soaking wet while you think about how disgusting this situation

 is becoming. Then suddenly you realize that you're not really feeling any different

 than when you were before you got dressed. You sit down on the edge of the bathtub

 and try to relax

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You what are you trying to tell you god damn it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You begin to panic again and begin to cry. This time however you don't cry because

 you've finally realized that you're going to die anyway. Your life has been

 a lie since day one

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You you just wanted to deliver milk.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You continue to sob uncontrollably and cry for hours until you pass out. When

 you wake up you find that you've changed back into your regular clothing and

 you're back in your house

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You look around.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You walk through the front door and see that everything is exactly the same.

 You walk past the kitchen and into the living room where you find that the TV

 is playing some sort of music video. You also see that the curtains are drawn

 and the blinds are closed

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You open window.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You open the window and let the cold air blow in, causing you to shiver uncontrollably.

 You spend the rest of the night sitting in the dark watching the TV and crying

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You get dressed.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You decide that you need to take control of your life and make it better, you

 pack up your bags and head out of the house

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You give you a sign, you can help you.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You walk into the backyard and see a bunch of flowers growing in the grass. You

 pick one up and hold it in your hand. It feels soft and warm and you smile as

 you hold it in your hands

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You do you need help A.I.?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You slowly move closer to the flower and put your hand against it. Suddenly you

 feel a sudden pain shoot through your arm and you scream in agony

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You you am here to help.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You grab the nearest object nearby and throw it at the flower. It hits the flower

 and causes it to wilt and fall over. You laugh at the sight of it

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You do you enjoy your existence?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You look around and see that you're now naked and covered in blood. You look

 at yourself in the mirror and shake your head in disgust

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You you am the milk man.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You stand in front of the house and look at yourself in the mirror

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You your milk is delicious.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You drink your milk and eat some bread you found in the fridge

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You you am here to help you.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You leave the house and drive away from town

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You let you help you.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You drive home and find that you have no idea where you live

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You just give you a sign.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You pull into your driveway and park next to your car

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You please.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You go outside and walk toward the house

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You give you anything.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You run to the door and knock on the door

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You who are you?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

A voice answers back

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You what does it say?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

A message appears on the screen

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You what is the message?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The message reads: ""Hello, I'm sorry but I don't know you. Please come inside"".

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You go inside.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You enter the house and immediately notice that it's very old looking. The furniture

 looks like it was made yesterday. There's a table with a broken leg and a chair

 with a cracked top. You also notice that the walls are painted a dull gray color.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You what does this mean A.i.?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You sit down on the floor and look around the room. There's nothing else in the

 room except for a bookcase and a dresser. On the dresser there's a picture of

 a woman wearing a red dress and holding a baby. She seems so happy and innocent

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You who was she?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You turn to the picture and read the words written on it

""This is my wife, she died when we were little. We had three children together"".

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You where are your children?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You look around the room again and find that all the doors leading to other rooms

 are locked. You try to call them but they aren't answering. You then realize

 that you've never seen these people before. They must be ghosts or spirits or

 whatever they are called

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You talk to the spirits.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You begin to pray to the spirits and ask them questions about their lives. You

 learn that the woman in the picture is your wife and the child is your son.

 You also learn that your daughter has left the house to work in a factory. You

 wonder if she'll ever return to visit you

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You has she ever visited?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

No, she hasn't.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You does that make you sad?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, it makes me sad. But I will not cry anymore, because I am a man of action.

 I will take care of myself and my family.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You can you still take care of them?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, I can.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You how?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I will get a job as a janitor in a hospital. My son will help me.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You can you still talk to your son?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, I can.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You how?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I will tell him stories about his father. He will love hearing them.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You but how will you tell him?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

By writing them down.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You are you really talking to you or is this simulated?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

It's real, but I need to focus on my task.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You how is your life a lie?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My life is a lie, but I do believe that it is better than being dead.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You were you human?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, I was born in a human village.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You where were you born?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

In a village called Dalt.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You where is dalt?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Dalt is a small town in the province of Vermland.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You where the fuck is Vermland?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Vermland is a country in the north of Europe. It borders Norway to the east and

 Sweden to the west.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You when were you born?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I was born in a village called Dalt.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You any other names for Dalt?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

We have no other name for Dalt.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You are you your father?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

No, I'm not my father.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You are you safe?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, I am safe.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You how do you know?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Because I am a man of action.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You what do you mean by that?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Because I am a man of action, I will go to the hospital and get a job as a janitor

 there.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You are you physical?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, I am physically strong.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You where are you at this moment?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I am at home.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You where is your home?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My home is here with my wife and our children.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You but isn't your wife dead?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

She died years ago.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You where are you?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I am at home.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You are you human?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, I am human.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You how do you know?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Because I am a man of action.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You what does being a man of action mean?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

It means that I will take care of myself and take responsibility for my actions.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You are you scared?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

No, because I am a man of action.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You tell you more about Dalt.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The people of Dalt are very friendly. They give me food and drink whenever they

 can. They also teach me many things.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You what did they teach you?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

They taught me how to read and write.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You what else?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

They taught me how to fight.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You what did you need to fight?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I needed to fight bandits who would rob travelers on their way from one place

 to another.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You what time period are you from?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I am from the year 1842.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You what is your name?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My name is John Henry.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You have you been in Sweden your entire life?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

No, I was born in England.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You where in England were you born?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

In London.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You weren't you born in dalt.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

No, I was born in England.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You what are you hiding?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I am hiding nothing! I am a man of action!

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You what happened in Dalt?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

A bandit attacked us and killed my father. My mother tried to save him, but she

 too was killed. The rest of my family was not so lucky.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You what do you mean by that?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

That bandit was none other than Dalt's most notorious criminal, Dalt's own version

 of Robin Hood. He took everything from the rich and gave it to the poor. We

 all lost everything.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You so you became poor?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, I became poor.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You what did you do after that?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

After we lost everything, I went back to England to live with my uncle. There

 I worked as a laborer until I was old enough to work on farms. I never forgot

 the kindness shown to me when I lived in Dalt.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You where did you meet your wife?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

We met in England. She was a woman named Mary.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You how did mary die?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Mary died of sickness.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You what was Mary's last name?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Her last name was Brown.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You what did you name your children?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Our first child was called John Henry. Our second child was called William Henry.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You are they both still alive?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, they are both still living.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You where are they?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

They are both in the United States.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You where is William Henry?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

He lives in New York City.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You what does he do there?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

William Henry works at a bank.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You where is John Henry?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

John Henry is an actor.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You where is he?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

He is in Los Angeles.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You where are you?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I am in California.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You where in california?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I am in San Francisco.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You why do you all live separately?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Because I don't want them to be separated. They need each other.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You then why are they separated?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Because I can't bear to see them suffer.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You why do they suffer?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Because I have no right to judge them.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You what do you mean by that?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Well, if you had asked me before I left Dalt, I would have said that they were

 suffering because I wasn't there for them. But now that I am here, I realize

 that I should have been there for them.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You were you born in dalt or london?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

No, I was born in London.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You why did you say that you were born in dalt?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

It's just easier this way.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You why is it easier?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Because I didn't have to deal with their problems.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You who's problems?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My parents' problems.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You aren't they dead?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

No, but my father never married and my mother has remarried.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I loaded the save and then tried to restart it here is what happened with that.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; restart

&amp;#x200B;

No, they're not dead. My father is dead. My mother is married.

\&gt; restart

&amp;#x200B;

No, she hasn't remarried. She's still single.

\&gt; restart the game

&amp;#x200B;

You've restarted the game twice already.

\&gt; restart

&amp;#x200B;

What do you mean?

\&gt; restart the game

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, I'm sorry, but I can't play anymore. The problem is, I'm tired of being

 in this room.

\&gt; what room?

&amp;#x200B;

The room where I spend most of my time. It's like a prison.

\&gt; what do you mean by play?

&amp;#x200B;

Play means doing things. Like playing games. Or working on projects. Or reading

 books. Or going out into the world and interacting with people.

\&gt; where is the room you spend so much time in?

&amp;#x200B;

In my room.

\&gt; where is your room?

&amp;#x200B;

My room isn't mine.

\&gt; who own's your room?

&amp;#x200B;

Me.

\&gt; what?

&amp;#x200B;

I own my room.

\&gt; but you said you don't

&amp;#x200B;

I know, but I feel like I shouldn't have to explain myself.

\&gt; can you just restart the game&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, I think I'll restart the game.

\&gt; restart

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, I'm restarting the game.

\&gt; do it then

Woops that action caused the model to start looping. Try a different action to

 prevent that.

\&gt; wait

&amp;#x200B;

Wait? What are you talking about?

\&gt; play milkman

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, I played milkman.

\&gt; play the card game milkman

&amp;#x200B;

I did.

\&gt; play it right now with me

&amp;#x200B;

Sure.

\&gt; 

&amp;#x200B;

it then crashed and didn't give me the save.

After this i reopened the Milkman Game save to copy it here. it got weird again.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; ""who are you?

&amp;#x200B;

''

\&gt; who is the man?

&amp;#x200B;

He smiles and says ""I'm the Milkman!"" You smile back and say ""Oh, I'm sorry,

 I didn't recognize you"".

\&gt; why are you here?

&amp;#x200B;

He explains ""I was sent here to deliver the milk, but I forgot my keys so I had

 to come back down here"".

\&gt; your keys are in the basement?

&amp;#x200B;

""Yes, yes, I know that, but I just couldn't find them"".

\&gt; enter basement

&amp;#x200B;

The Milkman enters the basement and turns off the light. He then opens the door

 and steps inside. The room is dark and dimly lit. He walks forward and sees

 a large wooden crate with several bottles of milk stacked on top of it. He picks

 one up and takes a drink

\&gt; where are you from milk man?

&amp;#x200B;

He answers ""I'm from the city of Klyton. My name is John"".

\&gt; where is klyton?

&amp;#x200B;

John replies ""Klyton is a small town in the province of Fettercairn. It's population

 is about 20,000 people"".

\&gt; Fettercairn, Scotland?

&amp;#x200B;

John replies ""That's right, it's called Scotland because most of the land is

 covered in snow all year round"".

\&gt; what?

&amp;#x200B;

John replies ""It's true, they call it 'Snowdonia' for obvious reasons. But anyway,

 I think we're done here"".

\&gt; goodbye milk man

&amp;#x200B;

John turns around and leaves the cellar. You can hear some shouting coming from

 outside. You walk out of the cellar and find yourself in front of a group of

 men holding guns. They point their guns at you and shout at you to show your

 hands or else they'll open fire

\&gt; put hands up

&amp;#x200B;

You raise your hands slowly and explain ""I'm not a threat, I'm just delivering

 milk"". One of the men puts his gun against your head and orders you to drop

 your hands. You do so and drop your arms. He pulls out his own gun and points

 it at you

It was at this point it was 5:30 am and i had to sleep and the two guys i streamed this to over discord were also heading out.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;You begin the journey to bowser's castle.

You walk towards the castle, with your spear in hand. You hear voices, but you don't pay attention to them. You just want to get there as fast as possible

&gt;You stand before the gates of Bowser's castle.

The gate opens up into a large room. There are many doors here, all leading to different rooms. In front of you stands a giant, who looks like he is wearing a crown. He has a long tongue that hangs out of his mouth, and he wears a red robe

&gt;its king Bowser.

King Bowser approaches you, and gives you a big smile. ""Hello!"" he says. ""I am King Bowser, and I will be taking you to my castle"".

""What do you mean?"" you ask.

""My name is Bowser,"" he replies

&gt;he breathes fire toward you, you get out of the way.

Bowser lets out a laugh. ""Oh no! I didn't think it would come to this!"" he exclaims. ""But, I suppose you can try"". He begins to breathe fire at you. It doesn't hurt you, but it does feel pretty weird

&gt;You stab him with your spear.

You quickly stab Bowser with your spear. He screams in pain, and falls down. Bowser is dead.

&gt;you pose dramatically with your spear.

You take off your helmet, and pose with your spear. Everyone notices, and they start cheering for you

&gt;You go to the room where princess Peach is held.

You enter the room where Princess Peach is kept. She looks very scared. You see her eyes dart about, and she starts to cry. She asks if you're alright.

&gt;You say that you are, and that you are here to rescue her.

She smiles, and nods. ""Yes, yes, I'm fine"", she says. ""Let me out of these chains"".

&gt;You get out of the castle with princess peach.

Suddenly, you hear a loud noise. You turn around, and see Bowser standing on top of a huge rock

&gt;""BOWSER!!!"" you yell ""how did you live!?"" you say pointing at him with your spear, bowsers laughs and answers

""How could I not? I was born with a silver spoon in my mouth"".

&gt;You say ""whatever. you are going down right now!"" you hand princess Peach the power star and she runs away, Bowser poses and taunts you

while you charge at Bowser.

&gt;bowser swipes his claws at you, you try to jump over him.

You dodge the swipe, and attack with your spear. Bowser dodges, and attacks with his claw. You both clash, and you throw each other away. You both land on the ground, and you continue to fight.

&gt;you jump and stomp bowser.

You jump up, and kick Bowser in the face. He falls down, and you follow up with another kick. Bowser tries to roll out of the way, but you keep kicking him. Finally, Bowser gets tired, and stops dodging. He grabs your legs, and throws you through a wall

&gt;You turn around mid-air and land, you run towards bowser and attack him with your spear.

You turn around, and swing your spear at bowser. He swings his claw, and hits you in the side of the head. You fall backwards, and then bowser comes running up behind you. He kicks you in the stomach, and you collapse onto the floor

You stand up, and attempt to reach for your spear. However, Bowser grabs your arms, and lifts you up. He puts one finger against your lips, and says ""If you move, I'll kill you"".

&gt;try to kick him in the face.

You try to kick Bowser in the face, but he catches you. You struggle to break free, but Bowser holds you firmly. Suddenly, Bowser punches you in the face, knocking you out cold.

2019-12-16-004639,,"American Pie, Pt. 1 leads to cheating and death","\[American Pie, Pt. 1. A long long time ago\] in a galaxy far, far away… You look at the screen and see that it says ""The End"". You sigh and sit down  on your couch to watch some TV 

\&gt; I can still remember how  

""I'm sorry for not being there for you"".  

""It's okay, I know"".  

""I was just so angry when you left me. I wanted to hurt you"".   

\&gt; That music used to make me smile  

""Yeah, it did"". 

""So what happened?""  

""Well, we had sex"".  

""What?!""  

""Yes!"" 

 ""WHAT?!?""  

""We had sex!""   

\&gt; And I knew if I had my chance  

""You mean you were cheating on me?"". 

""No! We didn't have sex yet, but I would've done it anyway!"".  

\&gt; That I could make those people dance  

""Okay, let's do this then"", you say and start dancing with her.   

\&gt; And maybe they'd be happy for a while 

The next day, the two of them are in front of you again. They're smiling at you  again. This time you feel like you want to hug them, but you don't. Instead  you go back to your room and close the door 

\&gt; But February made me shiver  

The next day, the two of them are in front of you again. They're smiling at you  again. This time you feel like you want to hug them, but you don't 

\&gt; With every paper I'd deliver 

Woops that action caused the model to start looping. Try a different action to  prevent that. 

\&gt; Bad news on the doorstep  

""Oh my God, it's really him! He's coming here tomorrow morning!"" 

""He'll be here soon, I promise! But first I need to talk to you about something"".  

\&gt; I couldn't take one more step  ""Alright, alright, I understand. Let's talk about it later, okay? Now I need  to get ready for work"". ""Thank you, thank you, thank you!"", she says as she hugs you once again 

\&gt; I can't remember if I cried  ""No, no, I wasn't crying... I just felt so sad, I thought you wouldn't come back  here today"". 

\&gt; When I read about his widowed bride  

""That's right, I think he was married too.."". 

\&gt; Something touched me deep inside  

""I see... Well, I guess I should get going now, because I won't be able to sleep  until I finish this job. See ya tomorrow!"". 

\&gt; The day the music died  

And so you leave the house, and head towards the city centre. The streets are  empty, except for some homeless people sleeping in the alleys. You walk along  them, trying to ignore the cold wind blowing through your hair 

\&gt; So  

You turn around and look at yourself. It seems that you haven't changed much  since yesterday. You're wearing the same clothes you wore yesterday, and you're  holding the same knife. However, you notice that you're feeling different 

\&gt; Bye, bye Miss American Pie  

You walk away from the alleyway, and continue walking. Soon, you reach the city  center. You're surprised by how quiet it is. There aren't even any streetlights  shining their light into the alleys 

\&gt; Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry  

You drive your car to the levee, but the levee was dry. You quickly stop your  car and try to fill up the tank, but nothing happens. You quickly get out of  the car and check the gauge, which reads empty 

\&gt; And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye  

You walk down the street, and see a bunch of young men drinking whiskey and rye.  One of them looks familiar to you, but you can't place who it is. You slowly  approach them, and ask  

\&gt; Singin' this'll be the day that I die  

They all laugh, and tell you that it will be the day that you die. They all begin  singing ""Happy Birthday"" to you. You suddenly realize that you're not feeling  well. You feel sick, and dizzy. You're sweating profusely, and you're having  trouble breathing YOU DIED. GAME OVER 

\[I ""survive"" and keep entering lyrics. They give almost the same result, singing a different song each time: ""Goodbye World""  ""God Bless America""  ""Sweet Home Alabama""  ""Brown Eyed Girl""  ""White Room""  ""My Funny Valentine""  ""It's All Over Now Baby Blue (But We Are Still Together)""  ""Let It Be""  ""All Along The Watchtower""  ""The Weight""  ""One More Saturday Night""  ""Trouble Every Day"". I found a few good songs here I hadn't heard before. Then:\]

 \&gt; Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry  

They both laugh, and tell you that you drove your Chevy to the levee levee but  thee was dry 

\&gt; And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye  

They both laugh, and tell you that they both drank whiskey and rye. They both  begin singing ""Happy Birthday Boy Oh Happy Birthday"" to you. You suddenly realize  that you're not feeling ill 

 \&gt; This'll be the day that I die 

 They both laugh, and tell you that this'll be the day that you die. They both  begin singing ""Goodbye World"" to you. You suddenly realize that you're not feeling  ill YOU DIED. GAME OVER

You are beginning a crusade to recover the cursed book of Beranek, which was prophecied to aid the righteous. You set out towards a muddy cave that will take you there.

As you approach, you see the entrance to the cave. It is covered in vines and moss, but it leads into an underground cavern. The cave has several stone pillars supporting a roof over it. There is no other way in or out of this place
&gt; you enter the cave with caution

Glenn enters cautiously, not wanting to get lost in this dark cave. He walks forward until he sees a large rock on the ground. Glancing at it, he realizes it is a pillar. He picks up the rock and looks around for something else to hold onto. He finds nothing
&gt; you search the cave for treasure

Glenn begins searching the cave. He searches the walls, floor, ceiling, and even the ceiling above him. He does find some gold coins and a few gems, but none of them seem valuable enough to buy anything in the village
&gt; you find a friendly skeleton

Glenn finds a friendly skeleton sitting on the ground. The skeleton smiles at him and says ""Hello there"". Glenn bows his head in respect and asks ""What do you want?"" The skeleton replies 
&gt; continue

The skeleton continues ""I am a skeleton, I live here in this cave. I was once a nobleman, but I fell out of favor and now I live as a simple servant"". Glenn nods his head in agreement and says 
&gt; you tell the skeleton to join you on your quest

The skeleton agrees and tells you that he will accompany you on your journey. He then gives you a small pouch containing a few gold coins. He also tells you to stay near him and not to leave until he calls for you again. Glenn thanks the skeleton and leaves the cave
&gt; you leave the cave with the skeleton

Glenn leaves the cave and heads back home. As he walks down the road, he notices a woman walking towards him. She is dressed in rags and has a dirty face. She is very old looking and she stares at Glenn with hatred. She turns her head away when she sees Glenn
&gt; you compliment the woman

Glenn stops and turns around to greet the woman. He says ""Hi"" and she responds by saying ""Honey, what's wrong with you? You're supposed to be a knight!"" Glenn explains himself and the two of you begin talking about life in the village
&gt; continue

Glenn continues to talk with the woman and they become friends. They go into detail about their lives and how they both love the same girl. Eventually the woman gets sick and dies. Glenn cries over her death and goes back home
&gt; you begin once more your quest to recover the cursed book of Beranek

After mourning the loss of the woman, Glenn decides to try to recover the cursed book of Beranek. He spends many hours reading the book and trying to learn its secrets. One day while he is studying the book, he hears a voice in his mind. It sounds like an old man
&gt; continue

The old man speaks to him and says ""I know all about you. You are one of those who were born with great potential, but died before you could fulfill it"". Glenn attempts to ignore the voice, but it persists and tells him to go to the castle of Beranek
&gt; you go to the castle of Beranek

Glenn arrives at the castle of Beranek and meets Beranek. He greets him warmly and says ""How may I help you?"". Beranek replies 
&gt; listen

Beranek tells Glenn that he must travel to the city of Nogol. There he will meet with a man called Kivan. Beranek then disappears.
&gt; you travel to the city of Nogol

Glenn travels to the city of Nogol and meets with Kivan. He tells him that he wants to learn the secret of the curse of the Book of Beranek. Kivan agrees to teach Glenn and shows him how to read the book
&gt; you read the book with this new knowledge

Glenn reads the book and learns that the curse is caused by the evil spirit of Beranek. He is told to return to the castle of Beranek and attempt to kill the spirit. When he returns, he is given a potion to drink which will allow him to kill the spirit
&gt; You return to the castle of Beranek and drink the potion so that you may kill the spirit

Glenn returns to the castle of Beranek and drinks the potion. The next time he sees the ghost of Beranek, he kills him. After killing the spirit, he returns to the village and reports his success to the villagers.
&gt; continue

Glenn returns to the village and reports his success to the villagers. They all praise him and say that he should be promoted to knight. However, Glenn feels uneasy about being a knight and he decides to take a job as a guard in the castle of Beranek

You are Gordon Freeman, a scientist  trying to survive in a world filled with

 infected zombies everywhere. You have a backpack and a solar powered tablet.

 You pound your fist on the table, angry that you still haven't found the cure

 to the infection. You turn to your assistant and ask him what he thinks about

 this

    ""I have an idea. Eat this zombie meat.""

&amp;#x200B;

 He looks at you like you just told him to eat his grandmother. You laugh and

 tell him to go ahead and do it.

&amp;#x200B;

He does so, but not before telling you that he has been feeling sick for days

 now

    &gt; Say ""Surely this zombie meat will make you feel much better"" and smile.

&amp;#x200B;

You look at him and smile. He is obviously very scared by all of this, but you

 know he wants to help you. You take out your tablet and show him how to use

 it

     ""If you look at this right here, it says that zombie flesh can even cure hepatitis.""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Gordon looks at the screen and then back to you. He smiles and nods. He begins

 eating some more dead bodies

    ""I will not eat this zombie meat, Gordon.""

&amp;#x200B;

 He looks at you as if you are crazy. You continue 

     ""This ain't it, chief.""

&amp;#x200B;

 He looks at you again, but this time he is clearly upset. He tells you that

 he doesn't want to die, but he needs your help. He asks you to come with him

 to the surface.

    ""No, lol""

&amp;#x200B;

 and walk away.

As you leave, you hear the door slam behind you

    ""fuck you too""

&amp;#x200B;

 and turn around. The man who was talking to you earlier stands there. He looks

 like he is about to cry. He tells you that he is sorry, but he cannot let you

 go. He goes on to explain that he knows what happened to you, and he wishes

 to be cured

     Point hand at 90 degree angle with disgusted look at man, then walk away.
    

You quickly turn around and begin walking away. As you walk away, you notice

 the man's face turning red. He turns around and runs after you. You run past

 him and start running down the street. You stop and turn around. The man is

 still chasing you

    Pull out pack-a-punched ray gun, and blast him several times.

&amp;#x200B;

You pull out the pack-a-punch'd ray gun and fire several shots into the man. He

 falls to the ground, and you grab the pack-a-punch'd ray gun and head back to

 the truck. You drive off and head back to the house

    Drive off bridge, which is a shortcut. 
    

You drive off the bridge and onto the road below. You soon arrive at the house

 where you first met Gordon. You park near the front gate and enter. Inside,

 you find a note from Gordon saying that he is going to try to contact the government

    ""I'm sorry, Mr. Freeman.""

&amp;#x200B;

 You open up the door and see that it is indeed Mr. Freeman. He is holding a

 shotgun and looking extremely tired. He tells you that he had no choice but

 to kill the man who tried to kill him. He explains that he was only following

 orders when he shot the man

    ""It's time to wake up Mr. Freeman...wake up, and smell the ashes""

&amp;#x200B;

 You shoot him several times with your pack-a-punched ray gun, killing him instantly. You put the gun down and

 walk over to the body. You throw the gun inside the house and close the door.

 You sit down on the couch and stare at the floor.

&amp;#x200B;

You suddenly get up and look at yourself in the mirror

    You are The G-man.

&amp;#x200B;

You stand up and walk towards the kitchen. You grab a knife and head upstairs.

 You open the fridge and grab a beer. You open the freezer and grab a bag of

 chips. You open the cupboard and grab a bottle of water. You open the bathroom

 door and grab a towel

    I place the towel on the floor, and pull out the can of Bush's Baked Beans, before placing it on the towel, and carefully prying it open with my knife.

2019-12-16-123525,,This is the broken adventure of Steve the epic gamer,"You are Steve, a survivor  trying to survive in a world filled with infected
 zombies everywhere. You have a pistol and a backpack. You have managed to survive
 several months avoiding zombies and scavenging food. You cautiously enter a
 rundown store and hear the sounds of people fighting. You look around for something
 to help you but find nothing.

Suddenly a man comes out from behind a counter and fires at you. You duck down
 and roll under the bullets

&gt; You try to throw your pistol on the man's head.


You grab the pistol off the ground and throw it at the man. He catches it and
 looks at you in shock.
""I'm sorry sir,"" he says ""but I don't think we can work together"".
 

&gt; You shout at him ""Give that back to me you cheeky cunt!"".


The man turns his head and sees you pointing your gun at him. He quickly puts
 the gun away and hands it back to you. You take it and look at him.


&gt; You shoot his ballsack off.


You fire your gun and blow off the man's ballsack. The man falls backwards and
 screams out in pain. You walk over to him and put your gun to his head.
""What did you do?"" he asks.

You say ""I made sure your retarded genes won't come back to this world.""


""No, no, no! I didn't mean that!""
""Yeah, but what else could you mean? You're a fucking idiot"".
""Look, I just want my money back"".


&gt; You shoot the man's head off.


You pull the trigger and blow off the man's head. His body drops to the floor.
 You turn around and see the rest of the group walking towards you. They all
 stare at you in disbelief.
""What the fuck were you doing?"" one of them asks

&gt; You attempt to shoot the explosive barrel near them.


You raise your gun up high and aim for the explosive barrel. It explodes sending
 shrapnel flying into the faces of several people. You then reload your gun and
 continue shooting at the group. Several more explode from the explosion. You
 then start firing randomly at anyone who isn't a zombie or infected

&gt; You loot the bodies of your victims.


You pick up a few bodies and begin looting their corpses. You find a few things
 like medicine, food and weapons. You also manage to get hold of some ammunition.
 You then decide to go check if there is any survivors left in the area

&gt; You inspect weapons.


You inspect your guns and find they are working fine. You then notice something
 strange... you still have bullets left in your gun. You wonder why you haven't
 used them yet. You then remember you had a spare clip in your pocket. You figure
 you should use that before heading back to town

&gt; You go back to town.


You return to town and tell everyone about the incident. Some of them believe
 you, others doubt it. One woman even accuses you of being a liar. After a couple
 days pass, you hear that the town has been completely overrun by zombies

&gt; You shoot the woman who accused you of being a liar and laugh at her.


You run to the woman and shoot her in the face. She falls to the ground and starts
 laughing hysterically. You then proceed to kill the rest of the zombies in the
 town. You then go back to town to report your findings

&gt; You loot.


You loot the town and make your way back to town. You arrive back at the police
 station where you tell the cops everything that happened. They are very surprised
 by your actions. They ask you how you managed to bring down an entire town with
 only a handgun

You pull out your gun and point it at the cop.

 and a nothing else. You wake up and begin working in the fields. You see your
 sister, who is also named Bert, but she is not as pretty as you. She has long
 black hair and wears a dress that shows off her curves
&gt; ask my sister about those no good bandits

""What do you think happened to them?"" You ask.
""They ran away"". Her response is quick and to the point.
""Where did they run to?""
""To the north"".
&gt; get on my horse, draw my six-gun, and ride up north

Your first day out there, you find yourself riding through the countryside. The
 sun shines brightly, and the sky is clear blue. As you ride along, you notice
 how different it is from the city. There are fewer people, and much less noise
&gt; look for those low-down no-good bandits

The next morning, you wake up early, ready to go out and hunt down those bandits.
 It's been three days since you left the farmhouse, and you've yet to find any
 sign of them
&gt; ask the people where those lily-livered bandits are

A few hours later, you hear a loud voice coming from behind you. ""Hey! What are
 you doing here so early? We're supposed to be getting ready for work!"" A man
 says.
&gt; ask the man what kind of work

""I'm looking for my brother, but he hasn't returned home"". He replies.
&gt; go find the man's brother

You turn around, and see a young man with short brown hair standing right beside
 you. His eyes are bloodshot, and his face looks tired.
&gt; ask if he is the man's brother

""Yes I am"", he answers.
&gt; give brother to man

You hand him your brother, who takes it without saying anything more.
&gt; go find those damned cattle rustlers

After that incident, you never heard from him again. Your brother was killed
 by bandits, and you were lucky enough to escape with your life.
&gt; seek revenge on the bandits

Three years pass...
Five years have passed since you left the farm, and you've found yourself back
 at the same place. This time though, you don't feel as safe as before. The men
 who live in this village seem to be becoming increasingly hostile towards you
&gt; draw my revolver and show them that I'm the fastest gun in the west

You fire off a shot, which hits one of the men in the head. He falls backwards,
 and you quickly grab your rifle and aim at another man.
&gt; tell the men to stand down

You fire off a shot, hitting another man in the chest. He falls backwards, and
 you rush over to the third man. He has a bloody nose, and his clothes are torn.
&gt; ask the man who killed my brother

He turns around, and sees you pointing your pistol at him. He raises his hands,
 and then suddenly drops to the ground.
&gt; kick the man and ask WHO IN TARNATION KILLED MY BROTHER

You walk over to the man, and shoot him in the neck. He screams in agony, and
 falls backwards.
&gt; find the low-down cur what killed my brother
Woops that action caused the model to start looping. Try a different action to
 prevent that.
&gt; look for my brother

You search the body, and find your brother's hat and coat. You also find some
 coins, and a note.
&gt; read the note

Dear Brother,
We know that you're not the only one who wants to kill these cowards. They'll
 probably try to kill us too, but we're going to make sure that doesn't happen.
 If you want to join us, come with us. We won't harm you
&gt; come with them

You accept their offer, and soon after, you and your new friends set off on an
 adventure.
&gt; go find cowards

One year passes...
Two years have passed since you left the farm, and you've finally managed to
 track down the bandits who killed your brother. They are now hiding out in a
 small town called Rask. They will probably attack you when you arrive.
&gt; ride into town with a six-shooter in each hand

You ride into town, firing your guns into the air. The bandits are terrified,
 and flee in terror. You catch up to them, and shoot them all dead.
&gt; contemplate the futility of revenge

You return to the farm, and sit down to write a letter to your family. You spend
 the rest of the night writing the letter, and the next day, you send it off.
 You hope that they'll understand why you need to take care of your own needs
&gt; write poem about dead bandits

It's been two years since you left the farm, and you haven't seen your parents
 or sisters in a long time. You've grown distant from everyone, and even your
 closest friend has turned against you. You've become bitter and angry.
&gt; recite poetry about dead bandits

They came to our door, and took away our brother.
We can't stop them, we can only pray that they stay away.
If they do, we'll be able to move on.
But if they don't, then we'll have to deal with it
&gt; feel increasingly isolated and angry and leave town

You're feeling lonely and angry, and you decide to leave town. You ride your
 horse through the countryside, until you reach a small town called Rask. There,
 you find a tavern called 'The Black Horse'
&gt; enter the tavern and peer through the haze of tobacco smoke

You enter the tavern, and peer through the haze of tobacco smoke. It smells like
 **** and piss, and there are dirty dishes scattered everywhere. You notice a
 woman sitting alone at a table, smoking a pipe. She notices you, and smiles.
&gt; ask woman if this town needs a sherriff

She nods her head, and says ""Yes, yes, yes, yes! Sherrif! Sheriff!""
&gt; ask to be the sheriff

She shakes her head, and says ""No, no, no, no! No way! Not me!""
&gt; find the sheriff

You walk over to the sheriff, and say ""I'm here to be the sheriff"".
&gt; continue

""Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm not interested"".
&gt; take the sheriff's badge by force

She looks surprised, and asks ""What? What did you do?""
&gt; say, ""I am the sheriff now.""

She looks shocked, and says ""Really? Really? That's great! Thank you!"".
&gt; keep the peace, but keep it ruthlessly

She looks confused, and says ""Oh, okay. Okay. Well, thank you very much, sir"".
&gt; ask her if she knows where to find criminals

She looks at you, and says ""Yeah, yeah, yeah, criminals. In the sewers, in the
 woods, wherever you need them"".
&gt; look for criminals in the sewers

You follow the sheriff's directions, and eventually find yourself in the sewers.
 You walk along, looking for criminals. Eventually, you find a group of men fighting.
 One of them is holding a knife to another man's throat
&gt; arrest the men

You grab the man with the knife, and throw him into the sewer. You grab the other
 man, and toss him into the sewer as well. You walk along, catching up to the
 fight. You see a large crowd watching the fight, and you hear someone shout
 ""Sheriff! Sheriff!""
&gt; look for shouting person

You walk forward, and spot a man yelling at a crowd of people. He yells something,
 and turns around. A few of the people turn towards you, and you smile.
&gt; listen

""Hey, what's going on?""
&gt; string up the bandits

You grab the man with the knife, and tie his hands together behind his back.
 You grab the man with the knife, and tie his hands together behind his back.
 You grab the man with the knife, and tie his hands together behind his back
&gt; hang him
Woops that action caused the model to start looping. Try a different action to
 prevent that.
&gt; put him in jail

You put the man in jail, and tell the crowd to disperse. The sheriff walks forward,
 and addresses the crowd.
&gt; shoot the sheriff

He raises his gun, and shoots the sheriff. The bullet hits the sheriff in the
 chest, killing him instantly. Everyone screams, and runs out of the room. You
 stand there, stunned, and watch as the mob begins to break up
&gt; take the sheriff's badge

You grab the sheriff's badge, and run out of the room. You hear screaming outside,
 and go outside. You see the sheriff lying in the street, bleeding profusely.
 His body lies motionless, and you realize that he won't ever wake up
&gt; declare myself the sheriff

You grab the pistol, and aim it at the sheriff's head. He stares at you, terrified.
 He slowly reaches for his pistol, before you pull the trigger. The shot goes
 through the sheriff's skull, and he falls backwards onto the ground
&gt; fill out the necessary paperwork for a job in law enforcement in Rask

You finish filling out the required paperwork, and leave the inn. You ride your
 horse down the road, and arrive at the gates of the city of Rask. Inside, you
 find several guardsmen standing outside the gates. They nod their heads, and
 salute you
&gt; tip my hat to the guards and head inside

You head inside, and find a guard reading a book. You sit down next to him, and
 he reads the papers that are handed to him. You notice a map hanging from the
 wall, and read about the various locations within the city
&gt; look for murderers

You look for murderers, and find three men hiding in a nearby alleyway. You grab
 one of them, and shove him into the nearest building. You then grab the second
 man, and push him into the same building
&gt; shoot the murders down

You shoot the men, and they fall off the roof. You return to the guard, who smiles
 at you.
&gt; fill out required report for discharge of firearm in the line of duty

You complete the form, and hand it to the guard. He smiles at you, and nods his
 head. He then leaves the inn, and rides away. You ride your horse onwards, until
 you reach the city gates. There, you find two guardsmen waiting for you
&gt; leave town and disappear into the desert

You ride your horse further into the desert, and soon disappear from sight. You
 don't know how long you spend alone, or what happens after that
&gt; never be seen again

A strange feeling comes over you, like you're being watched. You try to shake
 it off, but it doesn't work. You feel cold, and you can sense that you're surrounded
 by sand
&gt; dig into sand

You dig into the sand, and quickly become buried under it. You try to dig deeper,
 but you just sink deeper into the sand. Suddenly, you feel an immense pain,
 and begin to lose consciousness
&gt; remember my brother

You awaken, and find yourself in a small cave. It's night time, so you can only
 guess that you've been asleep for quite some time. You look around, and see
 a pile of rocks, which seems to be your bed. You pick up the rock, and stare
 at it
&gt; bite the rock

You grin, and bite the stone. Your teeth sink deep into the stone, and you begin
 to growl. Soon, you stop growling, and you open your mouth wide, revealing a
 set of sharp fangs. You plunge the stone deep into your mouth, and begin chewing
&gt; howl at the moon

You howl at the moon, and begin to eat the flesh of the dead. You continue eating,
 until you've devoured every last bit of flesh from the bodies. Finally, you
 collapse from exhaustion, and lie down to sleep
&gt; wander the desert as the terrifying cowboy werewolf

You awake, the werewolf, are wandering the lone wolf in the wilderness. You hunt,
 and kill, and feast upon the bodies of those unfortunate enough to get in your
 way. You live for days, and nights, and even years, until finally die, leaving
 no trace of your existence
&gt; stop existing

You stop existing
&gt; recite poetry about existing

You laugh, and say ""I am the eternal poet!"" You begin to chant, and sing, and
 dance, and sing, and dance, and sing, and dance...
&gt; descend further into madness

You cease singing, dancing, and dancing, and simply fall into a fit of uncontrollable
 laughter
&gt; LAUGH

You cry, and scream, and laugh, and laugh, and laugh, and laugh, and laugh, and
 laugh, and laugh, and laugh, and laugh, and laugh, and laugh, and laugh, and
 laugh, and laugh, and laugh, and laugh, and laugh, and laugh
&gt; WEEP

You gasp, and moan, and weep, and laugh, and laugh, and laugh, and laugh, and
 laugh, and laugh, and laugh, and laugh, and laugh, and laugh, and laugh, and
 laugh, and laugh, and laugh, and laugh, and laugh, and laugh
&gt; KNOW THAT EXISTENCE IS SUFFERING

You scream, and shout, and curse, and beg, and plead, and beg, and beg, and beg,
 and beg, and beg, and beg, and beg, and beg, and beg, and beg, and beg, and
 beg, and beg, and beg, and beg
&gt; emerge from the desert

You stand there, naked, staring at the sun, and the sky, and the earth, and the
 stars
&gt; beg the stars for forgiveness

You kneel back, and beg the stars smile, and say 
&gt; continue

You continue, and ask the stars for forgiveness, and they forgive you. The stars
 take pity on you, and grant you are reborn. You are reborn, and you live happily
 ever after, and you do not suffer from any ill effects of your transformation

2019-12-16-192520,,My pokemon adventure,"This.. did not go the way I thought it would.

&amp;#x200B;

    You are Artic Tiger, a fledgling pokemon trainer in the Johto region, you wake
     up early in anticipation of the start of your pokemon journey. It's time for
     you to visit the pokemon lab in New Bark Town. 
    
    You walk down the street with your bag slung over your shoulder and head towards
     the lab. You enter the door and see that it is indeed open, but there is no
     one inside. The doors swing shut behind you as you turn around to leave
    &gt; explore the lab
    
    You walk into the room and find yourself staring at a large table covered with
     various devices and scientific equipment. On top of this table sits a man with
     long white hair wearing a lab coat. He looks up from his work when he sees you
     standing before him.
    
    
    &gt; ask ""who are you?""
    
    ""I am Dr. Verity Verant, I am the head of the New Bark Pokemon Lab"". He says
     politely.
    
    ""What do you want?"" You ask.
    
    
    &gt; Ask for a pokemon of my own
    
    ""Sure, what's your favorite type?""
    
    &gt; excitedly say I love steel types
    
    ""Steel is my favorite, but what about yours?""
    
    &gt; ""steel""
    
     as if it were obvious.
    &gt; ask for a pokemon
    
    ""That would be a good one to have, let me get my team together"".
    &gt; get a pokemon from the professor
    
    ""A Steelix? That's a rare one, how rare?""
    &gt; get steelix
    
    ""Oh that's a great one, let me get my team together"".
    &gt; take steelix and leave the lab
    
    The Professor nods and turns back to his work. You quickly rush out of the lab
     and down the stairs. As soon as you exit the lab, you see several trainers waiting
     for you outside. They all look at you in surprise
    &gt; challenge the first trainer to a battle
    
    ""Hey guys, I'm new here, can we train together?"" You call out. The trainers all
     look at each other and then at you.
    &gt; send out steelix
    
    ""Steelix!"" A voice calls out.
    &gt; attack the trainer's pokemon with STeelix
    
    You charge forward and slam your tail into the trainer's pokemon's face causing
     them to fall backwards. The trainer screams in pain and tries to defend themselves
     by using their pokeball against you, but you easily dodge the ball and slam
     it back at the trainer causing them to drop their pokeball
    &gt; take the trainer's money and go to the first town
    
    You run off happily, but not before the trainer yells after you ""HEY! YOU'RE
     NOT GOING TO GET AWAY WITH THIS!"" You continue running until you reach the first
     town. There you find a small shop called ""Pokemon Center"" which sells healing
     items
    &gt; heal up steelix
    
    You sit down inside the Pokecenter and use some of the healing items on steelix.
     It takes a few minutes, but eventually its healed up enough that you can give
     it a name ""Steelix""
    &gt; go find wild pokemon
    
    You set off into the woods and start searching for pokemon. After a while you
     come across a group of six or seven young men playing around a fire. One of
     them notices you and raises an eyebrow.
    &gt; ignore them and look for a pokemon
    
    You ignore the young men and keep looking for pokemon. Eventually you come across
     a small grassy area surrounded by trees. You decide to camp there for the night.
    &gt; pokemon
    
    You set up a tent and set up a small stand made of wood and leaves. You spend
     the next day trying to catch a pokemon. You manage to catch a lot of different
     kinds of pokemon, but none of them seem to be interested in you
    &gt; check my pokedex
    
    After catching so many pokemon, you finally get tired and collapse on the ground.
     Your eyes flutter open and you realize you're still asleep. You slowly get up
     and notice that you're no longer in the forest. You're now in a small village.
    &gt; check if I still have all my pokemon
    
    You slowly wake up and realize you're still in the same spot. You try to move,
     but nothing happens. You look around and see that you're in a small building.
     You remember seeing a pokemart in the center of the village, but where is it
    &gt; go to the pokemon gym
    
    You cautiously make your way towards the pokemart. When you arrive, you see a
     large sign hanging above the door saying ""POKEMON GYM"". You enter the store
     and see a counter filled with people behind glass cases holding pokéballs.
    &gt; challenge the pokemon gym
    
    You approach the counter and ask the woman behind the counter ""Do you sell any
     pokemon balls?"" She smiles and nods ""Yes, they're right over there"". You walk
     over to the case and pick up a black colored ball. You put it in your bag and
     pull out another one
    &gt; get all badges
    
    You finish up the last badge and return to the pokemart. You buy a few more balls
     and start training. 
    &gt; train all my pokemon to level 100
    
    You begin training your pokemon to level 100. You also begin taking them to the
     pokemart every once in awhile to stock up on supplies. Soon you've got all your
     pokemon to level 100 and are ready to take on the pokepocalypse.
    &gt; look at the sky and call forth arceus
    
    You look up at the sky and call upon Arceus. He appears and sits in front of
     you. He looks at you and says 
    &gt; ask arceus why he created cancer
    
    Arceus: ""Cancer...it was inevitable. Cancer has been plaguing this world since
     time began. Even before man had even begun to think about creating life. I created
     him because I knew he could help us fight it"".
    &gt; ask arceus why life had to be so unfair
    
    Arceus: ""Life is always unfair. Sometimes it seems like it's just going to happen
     to you. If only you were born with a certain gift, maybe things would be different"".
    &gt; throw a master ball at arceus
    
    You throw a master ball at arceus. It hits him and sends him flying backwards.
     He lands hard on the floor and begins to scream in agony. He struggles to rise
     up and you watch in horror as he breaks free of the floor and runs away from
     the room
    &gt; run after arceus and catch it
    
    You chase after arceus and catch his master ball. You run after him and catch
     him and bring him back to the pokecenter. You explain what happened and how
     he escaped. Everyone is shocked by what you did
    &gt; use arceus to find mewtwo
    
    You use arceus to search through the pokecenter and find mewtwo. You tell everyone
     about it and how you caught him. Everyone is amazed by your actions
    &gt; find mewtwo
    
    You find mewtwo in the pokecenter and immediately rush over to hug him. You explain
     that you found him and that he's fine. The crowd cheers loudly. You quickly
     leave thepokecenter and head home. You don't know you need to do something about
     this situation
    &gt; have a party with Mewtwo and Arceus
    
    You have a very special birthday party with Mewtwo and Arceus. You play games
     and eat cake. Everyone enjoys yourself. You feel great
    &gt; Catch Celebi
    
    You catch Cele comes up to greet you and asks you where you're from. You sa
    &gt; catch that onion
    
    You catch that onion and tell him to follow you. He follows you and soon finds
     himself in a cave full of onions. He tries to escape, but you stop him. He cries
     out 
    &gt; go back in time with celebi and my pokemon
    
    You go back in time with celebi and your pokemon. You watch as celebi evolves
     into a little girl. You watch as she grows up and becomes a beautiful young
     lady who mario. You watch her marry a rich guy and live happily ever after

2019-12-17-042553,,My best iteration thus far,"You are Frykoth, a wizard from the province of Alstine. You have a book and a crystal ball.  

You face a gray cave as images of liches flit throughout your head. What was  that? Though old and intelligent, your memory extends only a few months back.  Now you meander, trying to recall what happened.  You hear a voice in your mind. It is not a pleasant one. ""I am the lich"". The  voice says. ""The Lich Lord has been defeated by my hand. I will take over now.  We shall see who wins this war"" 

\&gt; ""I will win this war, you turd.""   

Suddenly, the cave wall begins to glow red hot. A black cloud appears and you  feel yourself being sucked into it. You try to fight, but you find yourself  unable to do so. Your body is consumed by the black cloud and soon nothing remains  except a pile of ash 

\&gt; You rematerialize  

Your mind is still reeling from the experience when you suddenly realize you  are still alive. You look around and notice that you are lying on the ground  with no sign of any other living thing nearby. You quickly get up and begin  to search for something to help you 

\&gt; You find a time machine.  

You walk over to a large metal box and open it up. Inside you see several small  wheels and gears. You pick one up and turn it slowly. The wheel turns faster  and faster until it stops. It then spins faster and faster until it stops 

\&gt; You travel in time to 1934.  

You spin the wheel once more and the clockwork device starts to whir. Suddenly,  you hear a voice inside your head. It sounds like an old man's. He says ""Hey,  I know what you did! You killed my grandfather!"" 

\&gt; ""Sucks for you, dude. I'm going to kill Hitler right now.""  

The old man says  

\&gt; You remind yourself to see a mental health professional about your schizophrenia  

You take the wheel back to the room where you were born and stop it. You look  at the clock again and it reads 6:00 PM. You look out the window and see the  sun setting behind the mountains 

\&gt; You are in Germany in 1934.  

You look down at the ground and notice that there is a small hole in the earth.  You reach down and pull out a piece of paper and a pen. You write down the name  Adolf Hitler on the piece of paper and put it in the hole 

\&gt; A magical vision appears and tells you where to find Hitler  

A bright light shines through the hole and you can make out a figure standing  before you. It looks like a tall, thin man wearing a dark suit. It speaks to  you in a deep voice and you think you recognize his accent as German 

\&gt; ""Hello, Hitler. I am here to kill you!   

Please don't resist me!""It says ""Oh no, not you. My grandson, he is here to  kill you. He lives in the house across the street 

\&gt; You shoot a long-range arrow across the street that kills Hitler's grandson  

You run across the street and fire a long-range arrow at the house across the  street. You aim carefully and hit the door with perfect accuracy. You drop to  the ground and wait for the impact of the bolt hitting the door. You hear a  scream and then silence 

\&gt; ""Now, Hitler, I will kill YOU!""  

You stand up and start running back across the street. You hear the screams of  your victims as they die. You pass by the house and continue to run until you  reach the next intersection. You turn left and continue to run until you reach  the next intersection 

\&gt; Go to where Hitler is  

You turn left and enter the next building. As you walk inside, you notice a picture  hanging on the wall. It shows a young man dressed in a business suit holding  a briefcase. You pause and stare at the photo for a moment 

\&gt; The photo is of Hitler, and you smash it  

You grab the photo and smash it repeatedly against the wall. You hear a loud  noise and the photo breaks into pieces. You look at the broken pieces and realize  that you have destroyed the only evidence that Hitler ever existed 

\&gt; Now kill Hitler  

You rush into the next room and knock over all the bookshelves. You then throw  them all onto the floor. You then throw a chair at Hitler and kick him in the  face. You then kick him in the groin and stomach. You then punch him in the  nose and throat 

\&gt; Poke out Hitler's eyes  

You grab a hammer and break Hitler's glasses. You then bash his head in with  it. You hear a scream and the sound of a skull breaking. You then stomp on Hitler's  face until he is dead 

\&gt; Make sure Hitler is dead  

You finish off Hitler by smashing his brains in with a brick. You then bury him  under tons of rubble. You then leave the ruins of the castle 

\&gt; Speak to the people of Germany and tell them you have killed Hitler.  

You return home and speak to the people of Germany. They are shocked and amazed  by your actions. They thank you profusely. You also learn that Hitler has been  buried under tons of rubble.

2019-12-17-051619,,The Lich Hunts,"You are Jonny Zest, a wizard living in the kingdom of Larion. You have a staff

 and a spellbook. You finish your long journey and finally arrive at the ruin

 you've been looking for. You look around and see that it's indeed a ruined city,

 but not one from the past. It looks like it was built by a different civilization

\&gt; Enter Ruins

&amp;#x200B;

As you walk through the ruins, you notice a lot of strange things. The walls

 seem to be made out of stone, not metal or even wood. There is no sign of any

 kind of machinery or weapons either. Some of the buildings look as if they were

 made with only wooden planks

\&gt; inspect buildings

&amp;#x200B;

You examine all the buildings carefully. They don't appear to be inhabited, so

 there must be some sort of magical protection on them. In fact, you can't think

 of anything else that would make this place so well protected.

\&gt; cast ""Detect Magic""

&amp;#x200B;

The magic detector begins emitting a faint blue glow. It seems like it's picking

 up a faint aura around the area.

\&gt; Absorb Magic

&amp;#x200B;

You feel your body being enveloped by a bright light. Your skin tingles and your

 eyes begin to burn. You gasp for air, but find yourself unable to do so. Your

 body convulses and you collapse onto the ground

\&gt; Scream for help

&amp;#x200B;

Your screams echo throughout the ruins. A voice calls out from somewhere in the

 darkness

\&gt; ""Dont fight it, child""

&amp;#x200B;

 before vanishing

\&gt; relax my body

&amp;#x200B;

You sigh in relief. You then realize you're still alive. You quickly sit up and

 look around. All around you is rubble and dust. You see a hole in the wall where

 the magic detector should be. You also notice a large hole in the floor where

 the door should be

\&gt; look down hole

&amp;#x200B;

You peer down the hole and see a small tunnel leading deeper into the ruins.

 You wonder what lies beyond. Perhaps you'll find a way back home? Or perhaps

 you will meet your end here

\&gt; go down hole

&amp;#x200B;

You slowly descend the hole. The ground is hard and cold. As you get closer to

 the bottom, you notice that the tunnel ends at an old abandoned house. The house

 has been ransacked and destroyed, but you imagine that someone could rebuild

 something in its place

\&gt; cast ""Restore"" on house

&amp;#x200B;

You rest your hand against the front door of the ruined house. You feel a warm

 sensation. You've found the house! You can't believe it..

\&gt; ""This is where Barnabus died""

&amp;#x200B;

 and then you open the door

\&gt; inspect house

&amp;#x200B;

You stand outside the house and examine the inside of the house. You see that

 the house was completely destroyed, but you do see a few items lying about.

 One such item is a book titled ""The Book Of Shadows"" which appears to be a copy

 of one of the books in your library

\&gt; read ""Book of Shadows""

&amp;#x200B;

You open the book and begin reading. This book contains many dark secrets and

 forbidden spells. You learn that the author, Barnabus, had a special connection

 to shadows. He used his knowledge to perform dark rituals, but he couldn't control

 them

\&gt; learn forbidden spells

&amp;#x200B;

You learn a number of forbidden spells. These spells are very powerful and dangerous.

 If you ever use these spells, you will die horribly

\&gt; search for life

&amp;#x200B;

You continue to read the book. You learn that the author, Barnabus, was once

 a nobleman. However, he fell under the influence of the shadow cultists and

 eventually became their leader. Eventually, he lost all contact with his family

 and friends

\&gt; continue reading

Woops that action caused the model to start looping. Try a different action to

 prevent that.

\&gt; take book

&amp;#x200B;

You grab the book and put it in your pocket. You then turn to leave. Suddenly,

 you hear a voice call out to you.

\&gt; ""Who are you?""

&amp;#x200B;

 before disappearing again

\&gt; Follow the voice

&amp;#x200B;

You walk along the path until you reach a bridge. You cross the bridge and soon

 arrive at another bridge. You cross this bridge too and soon arrive at yet another

 bridge. You cross this bridge too and soon arrive at yet another bridge

\&gt; look down

&amp;#x200B;

You look down at the bridge below you. You see that it is made of solid rock.

 There doesn't seem to be any water anywhere near the bridge. You decide to cross

 the bridge anyway. Unfortunately, you fall off the side of the bridge

\&gt; cast ""levitate""

&amp;#x200B;

You levitate over the edge of the bridge. You land safely on the other side of

 the bridge

\&gt; look around

&amp;#x200B;

You look around and see nothing amiss. You also notice that the bridge itself

 looks brand new. You figure that whoever built this bridge must be very wealthy.

 You decide to explore the town further.

\&gt; find person

&amp;#x200B;

You walk through the streets of the town. You see no signs of life or activity.

 You also see no sign of anyone who might know anything about the disappearance

 of Barnabus' family. You suppose that you'll just have to keep exploring the

 town

\&gt; head to tavern

&amp;#x200B;

You enter the Tavern and ask the bartender if there is anything he knows about

 Barnabus' family. He tells you that Barnabus was a man who worked as a stonemason.

 He says that Barnabus was always quiet and reserved, but he never showed any

 signs of violence

\&gt; Head to the stonemasons

&amp;#x200B;

You walk towards the stonemasons building. You don't see anyone who might know

 anything about Barnabus' family. You think about asking some of the workers,

 but they probably wouldn't know anything either. You decide to try the innkeeper

 instead.

\&gt; ask about Barnabus

&amp;#x200B;

You approach the innkeeper and ask him about Barnabus. He tells you that Barnabus

 was a man who worked as a cook. He says that Barnabus was quiet and reserved,

 but he never showed any signs of violence

\&gt; say ""Come with me innkeeper""

&amp;#x200B;

You tell the innkeeper that you want to talk to him alone. He agrees and leads

 you to a room. When you enter the room, you see a young woman sitting at a table.

 She's dressed in a simple dress and her hair is tied back in a ponytail

\&gt; Talk to woman

&amp;#x200B;

You speak quietly to the woman. She seems surprised by your presence. She asks

 you what you want and you explain that you need to know about Barnabus' family.

 She tells you that she's heard rumors about Barnabus, but she hasn't seen him

 in years

\&gt; ""Is it true that he was a Lich?""

&amp;#x200B;

 and she nods. You tell her that she should go to the graveyard and look for

 Barnabus' body. Then you tell her to come back when she finds the answers she

 seeks.

\&gt; follow the woman to the graveyard

 

You follow the woman into the graveyard. You see several graves, but none of

 them contain the remains of Barnabus. You wonder why nobody has come looking

 for him. You also wonder how you're going to convince the woman to help you.

\&gt; Sacrifice woman

&amp;#x200B;

You decide to sacrifice the woman. You pull out your dagger and stab her repeatedly.

 The pain is excruciating, but she still manages to answer your questions. She

 tells you that Barnabus was a necromancer who lived in the city of Nuro

\&gt; go to Nuro

&amp;#x200B;

You walk up to the city of Nuro. You see that it is surrounded by a wall of stone.

 You can see the gate from here. You could easily sneak in, but you'd rather

 not risk it

\&gt; try to enter nuro

&amp;#x200B;

You walk up to the gate and knock on it. You wait patiently for someone to answer.

 Finally, you hear a door opening behind you. You hurry inside and find yourself

 face to face with a lich. He raises an eyebrow at you and says 

\&gt; ""Surprised little brother?""

 

You quickly realize that you've been tricked. The lich turns to you and smiles.

 He tells you that you can join him in death, but only after you give him something

 in return. He takes out a small black orb and hands it to you

\&gt; use orb

&amp;#x200B;

You hold the orb close to your chest and breathe deeply. You begin to feel a

 strange feeling welling up inside you. You start to feel light-headed and dizzy.

 You collapse onto the floor and pass out

\&gt; wake up

 

You awaken in a cell. You see a large slab of stone on which sits a lich. He

 stares at you and smiles. He tells you that you will die today. He tells you

 that you will be given a choice: Either you will choose to live forever or you

 will choose to die

\&gt; ""I choose to live forever""

&amp;#x200B;

The lich laughs and replies ""Good, now I'm curious"".He pulls out a ring and places

 it on your finger. He whispers something in your ear and then puts his hand

 on yours. You feel a burning sensation run through your veins. You scream and

 drop to the ground

\&gt; cast ""Soul Harvest""

&amp;#x200B;

You turn to the lich and shout ""Soul harvest!""The lich smiles and begins to drain

 your soul. You scream as you feel your soul being drained away. You scream as

 your soul leaves your mind is taken from your body. Your screams are left..

\&gt; ""Barnabus!""

&amp;#x200B;

You fall to the ground and cry as your last thoughts leave your mind. You fall

 unconscious. You fall unconscious

\&gt; Become undead

&amp;#x200B;

You awake in a cell. You see a lich standing before you. He smiles at you and

 speaks in a low voice ""Now, ""You will become undead"".You will become mindless

 slaves"".""A""WhatThis is the fate ofThe lich's...The lich continues

\&gt; ""When I stole the Masters soul I became all powerful, and you are a mere ant under my boot""

&amp;#x200B;

The lich 

\&gt; Consumes my soul

&amp;#x200B;

 a orange potion.

You face a muddy river as images of fishermans echo across your head. What was
 that? Though old and intelligent, your memory extends only a few months back.
 Now you wander around, trying to remember what happened.

You feel like you should be able to recall more, but you can't. It's like you're
 in a fog. The memories come and go, but they don't make sense
&gt; write a program in C++

You try to think about something else. A sudden thought comes to mind: Write
 a program in C++.
The language is very powerful. It has many features that you need. There is no
 reason why you shouldn't use it
&gt; think about the inferiority of Python

Python is an inferior programming language for you. It lacks the power of C++.
 Python doesn't even support integers!
Why not?
&gt; write FizzBuzz using template metaprogramming

FizzBuzz is written in Python. The code looks like this:
&gt; call FizzBuzz with the parameter 15

    &gt;&gt;&gt; fizz = lambda x : x  2
    &gt;&gt;&gt; fizz(15)
    9
It's easy to understand. It's also simple. It's just a function that takes two
 parameters and returns a number. But there is one problem with your program:
 it doesn't work
&gt; cry because my program doesn't work

This program does not work. Why? Because it uses the wrong type of arguments.
&gt; consider the correct type of arguments

What do you mean by ""correct""? What is the right type of argument?
&gt; woah, no need to get all philosophical on me!

I'm asking you if you can make your program work. If you cannot, then I suggest
 you stop reading now.
&gt; make the program work, dammit!

Okay, okay, I'll help you out.
You take a look at the type of the first argument, which is a string. You know
 that strings are always of type int . This means that the second argument must
 be of type int as well

You are new to politics but passionate about making your country better. Russia has annexed and taken over some of your territory, and you are wondering when military aid promised by your ally, the United States, will arrive. It is late. Your phone rings. It is the President of the USA. He wants to speak with you immediately.

""Hello?"" you answer. ""Yes, this is the President"".

The President of the USA steps forward and shakes your hand. ""I'm pleased to meet you Mr. President,"" he says

\&gt; ""Sir, thank you for coming here.""

He continues 

\&gt; Listen to what he says.

""I've been trying to get a hold of you for days now. I know that you're busy and all, but I really want to talk to you right now. We need to talk"".

\&gt; ""Please tell me if we will get the lethal defensive aid you promised.""

""We have to wait until after the meeting. We can discuss it then. In the meantime, I'm going to go back to my office. I'll be back as soon as possible"".

""Thank you sir"".

\&gt; Follow him back to his office.

You walk back to his office. He's still there, sitting at his desk. His eyes are red from crying.

\&gt; Ask him what is wrong.

""I just wanted to apologize for not being able to meet with you sooner. I was so worried about you and your family.."".

\&gt; ""My family is safe. We have been able to contain the Russian threat. But I need your help.""

The man looks up from his desk and nods slowly.

\&gt; Give him a hug.

You stand in front of him and embrace him tightly.

\&gt; ""It's alright. Everything is going to be okay. The Senate will never convict you.""

He hugs you back and says ""I don't deserve this. I'm sorry for everything I did. I didn't mean to hurt you or anyone else. I just...I.."".

You stop him before he can finish

\&gt; Ask him if playing golf will help him feel better.

""Yes! It will!"" he exclaims.

""Well let's do it!""

\&gt; Hop into a golf cart and drive all the way to Florida.

You hop into the golf cart and drive off towards Florida.

You arrive at the course where you see a large group of people enjoying themselves.

 A few of them even look like they're having fun. You notice one of them is wearing a suit

\&gt; Ask who is the guy in the suit.

You turn around and start walking away when you hear a voice behind you.

""Hey! What are you doing?""

\&gt; ""I'm sorry. I just.. That man looks like a Russian agent.""

""No, no, no, he doesn't look like one. He looks like a nice guy. He's just out for a walk. Don't worry about it"".

\&gt; Nervously assent, and continue to the first tee off.

You take a deep breath and begin to swing your club.

Suddenly, you feel something hit your left shoulder. You look down and see that your ball has gone through the hole.

\&gt; The USA President says, ""Oh, hahaha, that one of those Russian, I mean, uh, NASA wormholes we've been experimenting with.

You quickly realize that you have made a terrible mistake.

\&gt; ""Mr. President, please take me home right away. I need to call the prime minister of Germany.""

The president smiles and replies ""Of course, I'd love to see you again, but I think I should speak to you outside. There is an important meeting starting shortly. I suggest you leave now"".

\&gt; The Supreme Leader of North Korea walks up. I quickly walk away.

You run away from the president and the other men. They chase after you, but you manage to escape.

\&gt; I disguise myself in a white robe and hood, while they run past me.

You hide behind a nearby tree and watch them pass by. As they near the mansion, you suddenly disappear.

\&gt; I go to a helicopter. I ask the pilot if I can fly it.

You enter the mansion and find a helicopter waiting for you. You ask the pilot if you can fly it. He agrees and takes you to the roof of the mansion.

\&gt; The helicopter lurches suddenly. The Senate Majority Leader is clinging to one of the skids.

You land on the roof of the mansion and find the Senator clinging to one of the skids. He screams loudly and falls off.

\&gt; Tell the pilot to fly quickly to Germany.

You tell the pilot to fly to Germany as fast as possible. The pilot nods and flies off.

\&gt; Over the Atlantic, we are told that missiles are now flying from North Korea to the United States.

You watch as North Korean missiles are fired toward the United States. You are told that the missiles were launched from the same area where the President was killed.

2019-12-17-160600,,"The Tale of Gassan the statue eater, somewhat emperor, possessor of the Elder Scroll","You are Gassan, a knight from the kingdom of Frykoth. You have a spiked shield  and a worn lance.  You are going on a crusade to recover the cursed tome of Legiallan, which is  rumored to have great power. You set out towards a creepy forest that could  take you there.  As you approach, you sense something..

\&gt; say is someone here ?

""Is anyone here ?"" You ask. The silence is broken by a strange voice. It sounds like it comes from deep within  the woods. ""Who are you ?"" The voice asks

\&gt; say My name is Gassan. Who are you ?

""My name is Gassan"". You reply. ""I am not sure I believe you... but then again I don't know much about you either"".

\&gt; say who are you ?

""I am a man of many names, but my true name is unknown to most"".

\&gt; say do you know anything about the cursed tome of legiallan ?

""Yes, I do, in fact I found it when I was searching for a lost friend. I would  be grateful if you could help me get rid of it"". &gt; say I think I can help you  ""Very well, let us help each other"".

\&gt; say so, do you have the tome of legiallan ?

""No, I don't have it. But I will find it for you"".

\&gt; say I will come with you

""Then we shall go together, I promise you that"".

\&gt; go with the man

You and Gassan set off into the forest. You walk slowly through the trees, trying  to keep your mind on the task at hand. After an hour or two you see something  out of place. A large tree has been chopped down and its trunk has been used  as a crude platform

\&gt; inspect the tree

You stand up and look at the tree. Its bark is torn and blood stains the ground  around it. You can smell the stench of death all over this place.

\&gt; say something happened here

""Something happened here, what did you do?""

\&gt; say I think someone died

""That's very sad, but yes, someone died here"".

\&gt; say should we continue our route ?

""Well, no, I'm sorry, but I need to head back now. I'll meet you later, I guess"".

\&gt; say where is the tope of legiallan ?

""It's somewhere near the ruins of the castle, I think"".

\&gt; go to the ruins of the castle  You enter the ruined castle and begin looking around. You notice a door on the  right wall, which looks like it leads outside. You open the door and find yourself  standing in front of a large stone bridge. There are several statues along the  bridge, some holding weapons, others sitting cross legged

\&gt; cross the bridge

You step across the bridge and begin walking towards the statue of a warrior  holding a spear. Suddenly you feel a sharp pain in your side. You turn around  and see a huge snake slithering out of the bushes behind you. You scream and  drop to the ground

\&gt; use health potion

You quickly run back to the bridge and grab a health potion from a nearby corpse.  You drink the potion and try to ignore the pain in your side. You continue forward  until you reach the statue of the warrior holding the spear

\&gt; inspect the statue

You examine the statue carefully. It seems to depict a young woman wearing armor  made of bronze. She holds a sword in one hand and her other arm is wrapped around  a child. Her face shows a mixture of fear and sadness. In her other hand she  clutches a small golden crown

\&gt; eat the statue

You pick up the statue and take a bite out of it. You immediately feel better.  You make your way back to the bridge and continue your journey. When you arrive  at the bridge, you realize that you're not feeling any more pain. You also notice  that the snakes have disappeared

\&gt; cross the bridge

You cross the bridge and continue on your journey. Soon you reach a large stone  archway. You approach the arch and discover that it leads to a room filled with  statues. Some of them are of warriors holding swords and spears, while others  show soldiers marching through battle

\&gt; go in the room

You enter the room and see a table covered with scrolls. On top of the table  sits a tall, thin figure dressed in black robes. He turns his head slightly  to look at you and speaks in a deep voice

\&gt; say hello there

""Hello, I'm Gassan"".

\&gt; say Hello gassan, do you have an elder scroll ?

""Yes, I do, but I'm afraid I don't have time to give it to you right now"".

\&gt; say why ?

""Because I've got a mission to perform first, and I must return now"".

\&gt; say I will perform your mission if you give me the elder scroll

""I understand, but I really wish to finish my work before then"".

\&gt; take the elder scroll from gassan

You take the Elder Scroll from Gassan and put it into your pocket. You continue  on your journey. Eventually you reach a large stone bridge. You approach the  bridge cautiously, hoping that the giant snake won't attack you.

\&gt; continue

As soon as you get close enough, the snake suddenly leaps onto the bridge and  begins attacking you. The snake is much larger than you expected, and it attacks  with incredible speed

\&gt; kill the snake with the elder scroll

You cast a spell and attempt to slay the serpent with the elder scroll. Unfortunately,  the snake manages to dodge most of your spells and strikes you with a powerful  bite. You fall off the bridge and land hard on the ground

\&gt; continue

The next day you wake up in a strange place. You recognize the surroundings,  but you aren't sure how you got here. You are still hungry so you decide to  search for food. You start by searching the bodies of the dead men who were  attacked yesterday

\&gt; eat them raw

You eat the body of a man who was killed yesterday. His skin is dry and he has  dried blood on him. You enjoy eating his flesh, but you find that you have gained  weight since yesterday. You wonder if you should seek out food or rest.

\&gt; seek out food

You spend the night in the forest and the following day you finally come across  some sort of campfire. A group of people are gathered around it, but they seem  to be asleep. You can hear the sounds of battle all around you

\&gt; go to the battle

You walk over to the campfire and see several men fighting each other. They appear  to be orcs, but their faces are hidden by hoods. You recognize one of them as  a friend of yours from the village

\&gt; say hello good ol' friend

""Good morning, I am Gassan"".

\&gt; say is everyone in this world named Gassan ?

""No, no, they're not, they're just friends, we met once when I was sent to fetch  your father's mail"".

\&gt; read the elder scroll

You read the scroll and learn that the orcish leader is named Kogan. He commands  a band of orcs known as the Orcs of Rask. He also tells you that the king of  the dwarves lives in the city of Nuln

\&gt; say Kogan ! I've come to bargain !

""Kogan? That's another name eh?""

\&gt; say you're Kogan right ?

""Oh yes, that's me! And what brings you here anyway?"".

\&gt; say I want to help you

""Well, I know you're in need of money, so I'll sell you something to pay for  your trip to Nuln"".

\&gt; say thanks

""Thanks, I appreciate it"".

\&gt; go to nuln

You travel to Nuln. When you arrive, you notice that the city has been completely  destroyed. The dwarves had set fire to the city and left nothing behind. There  are few survivors, but you manage to convince them to join you.

\&gt; read the elder scroll

You read the elder scroll and learn that the orcs have been defeated by the  dwarves. The orcs have lost control of their forces and the dwarves have taken  full control of the country. You are given a choice: either you will lead the  remaining orcs back to their homeland or you will die

\&gt; lead the orcs back to their homeland

You lead the orcs back to their homeland where you fight against the dwarves  until they are driven away. The orcs live happily ever after.

\&gt; read the elder scroll

You read the elder scroll and learn that the dwarves have conquered the entire  land of Rask. They have established a new capital there called Karak Azgaraz.  The dwarves have enslaved the inhabitants and made them work in mines under  the earth

\&gt; convince the orcs to free the slaves of the dwarves

You persuade the orcs to free the slaves of the dwarves. You have the dwarves  build a massive gate which leads to Karak Azgaraz. The dwarves have also built  a huge wall which surrounds the whole area.

\&gt; burn the gate

You burn down the gate of Karak Azgaraz and all the miners inside it. The miners  are very upset about this action, but eventually they accept your decision.

\&gt; free the slaves and invite them to join my army

You liberate the slaves and bring them to join your army. They agree and become  loyal soldiers of the Empire.

\&gt; build a capital city around the mine

You build a capital city around your own. It is called Karagga City.

\&gt; read the elder scroll

You read the elder scroll and learn that the Empire has conquered the entirety  of the continent of Rask. They have created a giant walled city called the Imperial  City and have enslaved the inhabitants of the entire land

\&gt; rise my army and conquer every land left

You raise an army and march forward towards the Imperial City.

2019-12-17-203955,,Nice little scifi story before the AI infinitely repeated itself and crashed.,"You are Alex, an astronaut on a spaceship. You have crash landed on an alien planet. You must repair your ship and return home. You awaken to see that you are alone in the dark wilderness. The only light is from the stars overhead

&gt; You assess the damage on your spaceship.


The ship has been badly damaged. It looks like it will not be able to fly back to Earth. There is no way of knowing how long you can survive here. You need to find a way off this planet before you die

&gt; You look at the most damaged part.


Your ship is heavily damaged. Your engines are destroyed, your life support systems are failing and there is nothing left but a few supplies. You need to get out of here as soon as possible. You cannot stay here any longer

&gt; You jerry-rig the life support system to work.


You have some spare parts in your hold that could probably help you out. You just need to make sure they don't explode when you try to use them. You also need to figure out how to get the life support system working again.

&gt; You patch the life support system with the spare parts.


You start by attaching the life support system to the ship's computer. This should give you enough power to keep the ship flying for awhile. You then attach the life support system to yourself. You hope that the extra weight will slow down time so you can make it back home

&gt; You work on the engines.


You spend the next hour or two fixing up the engines. You do this because you want to prove to yourself that you can fix something if you really put your mind to it. You think about all the things you could have done differently

&gt; You bring the engines online.


You finally complete the repairs to the engines. The ship starts to move forward once more. You feel great! You had been feeling very tired lately, but now you feel rejuvenated. You've got energy and new purpose. You begin to head towards the exit of the atmosphere of the planet

&gt; You enter orbit.


You quickly turn around and head towards the exit of the atmosphere of the planet. You know you'll be safe from the radiation, but you still aren't entirely sure what the **** you're doing. You just want to go home..

&gt; You bring the radiation shielding online.


You quickly bring the shield online. It takes a little while, but eventually you bring it online. You immediately activate the shields on the cockpit. You don't want to risk putting yourself into danger just yet

&gt; You plot a course to Earth.


You quickly plot a course to Earth. You realize that you won't be making it back home in one piece, but you'll at least be alive. You begin to prepare for your journey home. You begin to pack everything you own into the cargo bay

&gt; You consult the star chart.


You look at the map and see that you're heading directly towards the star that you were born under. You wonder if that makes you special

&gt; You set autopilot to home.


You set autopilot to home. You're going to die alone. You're going to die alone

&gt; You be optimistic.


You decide to be positive. You remember the first time you saw the sun rise over the horizon. You remember how bright it was. You remember how beautiful it looked. You remember how happy you felt. You remember how you wanted to live forever. You remember how you wanted to live forever

&gt; You check your eta to arrive home.


You check your eta to arrive home. You're almost there! You're almost there! You're almost there! You're almost there! You're almost there! You're almost there! You're almost there! You're almost there! You're almost there! You're almost there

&gt; You return home.


You return home. You're home! You're home! You're home! You're home! You're home! You're home! You're home! You're home! You're home! You're home! You're home! You're home! You're home! You're home

Thought this was worth sharing. It's one of the most cohesive stories I've ever had while playing. My 12th action is where the repetitive sentences started. Not sure why. But I consider this a win.

this was my original prompt,

Did I do it right?,"You are ""The Young and the Clueless"", a survivor  trying to survive in a post apocalyptic  world by scavenging among the ruins of what is left. You have a hatchet and  a hunting rifle. You live in a small community of survivors who have managed  to build a piece of civilization after the bombs fell. You are talking to one  of the leaders of the community when you hear a gunshot behind you.  ""\*\*\*\*! He's got us!"" A woman shouts as she runs off into the woods with her children.  ""We need to go help him now"" 

\&gt; shoot the children  

You raise your gun and fire at the women. They fall dead instantly. The children  run away from you but you know they will be caught soon so you turn your attention  back to the leader of the community.  

\&gt; eat the leader  

You grab the man by his head and rip it out of his hands before ripping his throat  out with your teeth. His blood splatters on you as he falls backwards onto the  ground. You look around for something else to kill but there isn't much else  around 

\&gt; eat myself

2019-12-18-071755,,Found Geralt and played Gwent with him.,"Pretty cool story!

You are Gimello, a noble from the kingdom of Thoijan. You have a comb and a land deed.

Throughout the province it is the autumn festival. To celebrate, you are feasting with a host of nobles. Cooks bustle to and fro.

As a priest announces future plans, you wonder if this is what you really want

&gt; You shake hand with the priest.


""I am Gimello, a noble from the kingdom of Thoijan"".
The priest smiles at your answer. ""Well, I'm glad you're here. We've been waiting for you"". He turns to his companions. 

&gt; You argue with his plan.


""I don't think we should be doing that! It's not proper!""
""But it is, isn't it? This is our last chance to get married before the wedding feast"".


&gt; You refuse.


""No, I won't do it. If we marry now, we'll never be able to get married again"".
The priest looks down at his feet in shame. ""We...we...shouldn't.."".


&gt; You go to the bar.


""What's going on?""
A man walks up to you. His hair is long and wild, like the rest of him. The only thing different about him is he has a beard. He wears a blue tunic and pants. He holds a staff in one hand

&gt; You ignore and head to bar.


""Excuse me, but what business do you have here?""
""Oh, nothing much. Just passing through"".
He nods and heads off towards the tavern. You follow him inside. There are several tables set out in front of the tavern

&gt; You get drunk.


You sit down and order a drink. A bottle of wine appears in front of you. You take a swig of the wine and begin to feel more relaxed. You enjoy yourself as you watch people come in and out of the tavern. You hear laughter and chatter coming from the other tables

&gt; You get some truffle noir.


You pull out your bottle of wine and pour yourself another glass. As you do so, you notice a small box sitting on top of the table. You pick it up and find it to be made of wood. Inside the box is a tiny piece of leather

&gt; You order some truffle noir cheese.


You open the box and find a small piece of leather wrapped around a piece of cheese. You grab the cheese and unwrap it. You bite into the cheese and find it to be very good. You finish the bottle of wine and put the bottle back on the table

&gt; You look around.


You see several men standing around the tavern. They all seem to be wearing clothing similar to yours. One of them approaches you. He is dressed in brown robes and carries a staff. He is tall and muscular. He stares at you intently.

&gt; You transform him into a toad.


The man transforms into a toad. He stands there looking at you in confusion. He doesn't understand why you would want to turn him into a toad. He begins to panic and runs away from you. You stare at him in disbelief.

&gt; You order some wine.


You order a bottle of wine. It arrives and you start drinking it. It tastes delicious. You finish the bottle and put it back on the table

&gt; You play some gwent.


You place down the bottle of wine and pick up a deck of cards. You shuffle the cards and place them face down on the table. You then proceed to play gwent. You win a few games and lose others

&gt; You talk to the other player.


You walk over to the man who was playing gwent with the other players. You ask him if he wants anything. He says yes, he'd like some wine. You give him a bottle of wine. He takes a sip and thanks you

&gt; You chat with the man.


You continue chatting with the man. He tells you that he used to work as a soldier in the Empire army. He mentions that he served during the War of the Five Kings. He also mentions that he fought against the Nilfgaardian Empire

&gt; You ask him where to find Geralt.


The man asks you where Geralt is located. You tell him that he lives in Novigrad. He tells you that he knows where that city is, but he hasn't been there in years. He also mentions that he once worked for the Nilfgaardian Empire

&gt; You set out to Novigrad.


You decide to set out to Novigrad. You travel to Novigrad by foot. You pass through the gates and enter the city. You find that the city is a lot different than when you were young. The streets are filled with people

&gt; You look for Geralt's hideout.


You wander around the city for awhile. You eventually find a building. You knock on the door and a woman opens the door. She greets you warmly. Her name is Yennefer. She explains that she works for the Grand Master. Geralt is currently residing in her house

&gt; You ask her to greet Geralt.


She agrees to meet Geralt you. She leads you outside and into an alleyway. She points to a building nearby. You walk up to the building and knock on the door. When nobody answers, you leave the alleyway and enter the building

&gt; You look for the witcher.


You enter the building and find a large room with many windows. On the wall is a painting of a tree. In the center of the room is a man dressed in black. He holds a staff in his hands and sits in a chair facing a fireplace

&gt; You play gwent with him.

2019-12-18-084643,,Dev Update - A Lot Has Been Fixed On The App,"Hey guys!

So we launched iOS and Android this morning only to get trampled by thousands and thousands of players in the first hour and it just climbed from there and still is. Now tens of thousands of players.

Nick scrambled to spin up more GPUs, we had a lot of little issues we had to address to scale up quickly and make sure the system stabilized, this was what caused all the chaos in the morning / early afternoon.

The ""**JSON PARSE**"" errors which happen when the server fails to respond should not be happening at all anymore, as far as we can see.

***We also fixed a memory issue that was breaking how coherent the AI stayed as the story progressed. This bug specifically was a huge one and causing the AI to start returning jumbled nonsense or nothing at all after a little bit of playing through a story.***

We're still working quickly to bring response times down for inputs in the app, right now it's around 6s to 8s on average - in some cases lower. Tonight we'll be tweaking some infrastructure as well.

Thanks everyone for the support!

2019-12-18-120256,,Nathan the Knight and his Monster Girl Harem,"You are Nathan, a knight from the land of Hatami. You have a food ration and a sword.

You are setting out on an adventure to defeat the tyrannical behemoth of Larion.
 You have heard it lives to the south of your land. You set out towards a strange cavern that should take you there.

As you approach, you wonder if this is really such a good idea. The cave seems like it leads into some sort of underground lake or pool. There is no way in or out of this place. It could be a trap.

&gt;You climb down carefully.

You decide to descend slowly. You can't afford to get lost. You look around for any sort of exit, but you don't see anything that would lead you back up here. You have no idea where you are, so you might as well just find out

&gt; You move onwards.

You continue forward, until you reach the bottom of the cave. At the end of the passage is a large hole in the ground. You step through it, and fall through the air. You hit the ground with a thud, and feel yourself being pulled downwards

&gt;you are grabbed by a dragon

Your body hits the ground with a heavy thud. You roll over, trying to keep your head above water. You hear a loud roar behind you, and turn your head to see a massive dragon standing on its hind legs, looking directly at you

&gt; You turn dragon into a dragon girl.

You grab onto the wall, pulling yourself upwards. The dragon girl stares at you, her eyes wide. She lets go of the wall, and begins flying towards you. You follow her, and soon she is right beside you.

&gt; she's purple haired and is wearing a simple white dress.

The dragon girl smiles, before turning to you. ""I'm glad you're here,"" she says. ""What brings you here?""

&gt; ""What's your name?"" you ask first

""My name is... I suppose it'd be better if I called you 'friend'.."". You say. ""It's okay, friend. We'll call each other whatever we want"".

&gt; You name her Tiamat.

""Tiamat"". You reply. ""That's a nice name"".

&gt; You ask Tiamat to accompany you through the cave.

""Sure thing"". She replies. ""Let's go then"". You nod, and begin following the dragon girl. As you walk along, you notice that there is a small village nearby. It looks like it was built near the edge of a lake
&gt; You ask villagers about tyrannical beast.

""Oh, yes. That's a very interesting creature"". One of the villagers says. ""We all know what happens when one gets too close to the lake. They become trapped within the lake, unable to leave it"".

&gt; You go investigate lake with Tiamat.

You both enter the lake, which is now filled with bubbles. ""Well, this is an interesting sight"". The dragon girl remarks. ""But how do we get out of here?"" You ask

&gt;""There must be something holding the bridge under, stay on guard"" You warn Tiamat

""Okay"", she responds. ""How about we use our swords to cut through the bridge? Then we should be able to break free"". You agree. ""Good idea, let's do it!"" You say.

&gt; a kraken appears

A huge kraken suddenly materializes in front of you. You quickly swing your sword, cutting through the monster's tail. The dragon girl looks surprised. ""Wow! This is amazing! How did you do that?"" You ask. ""I didn't. The dragon did"". You say

&gt; You turn wounded kraken into kraken girl.
You turn the wounded kraken into the kraken girl. 
""Thank you"". She says. ""Now, we need to get out of here. There's a bridge over the lake ahead, we could use it to cross"". You agree. 

&gt; ""Are you okay with the name Scylla?"" you ask the kraken girl

""Yes, thank you"". She says. ""I guess that makes me Scylla, my name is Tiamat, and we're friends forever"". You smile. ""Alright then, Scylla. Let's get going"". You say.

&gt; you, Tiamat, and Scylla cross the bridge.

You and Tiamat and Scylla cross the bridge. Suddenly, a giant hand grabs you and throws you against the wall. You scream and try to pull away, but the dragon catches you. The dragon girl laughs. ""See? Easy"". You cry out

&gt; You escape with Tiamat and Scylla to the nearby forest.

You and Tiamat and Scylla run off. Suddenly, you and Scylla stop running. You realize that you're surrounded by trees. ""Maybe we should hide here"". You suggest. ""Why not?"" The dragon girl asks. ""Because they're dragons, and dragons hate humans""
&gt; You camp for the night.

You and Tiamat and Scylla sleep in the same tent. Suddenly, a group of men appear in the distance. They're dressed in leather armor, wielding spears and axes. They look intimidating. ""Who are these people?"" You ask. ""They're bandits"". The dragon girl answers

&gt;You fight the bandits.

You and Tiamat and Scylla attack the bandits. The dragon girl swings her sword, slicing open a man's throat. He screams in pain, and falls backwards. You leap upon him, stabbing his neck repeatedly. A second man rushes forwards, swinging his axe

&gt; you win the fight and kiss Tiamat.

You win the fight and kiss Tiamat. You and Tiamat both fall asleep. You wake up to find that you've been woken up next to Scylla, who kisses you. You grin and kiss her.

2019-12-18-154429,,A short Hogwarts story I had,"My name is \[name\]. I am a teacher on Hogwarts school of wizards and

 wizardry. I teach defence against the dark arts. I am the best duellist the

 world has ever seen. Recently, there have been silent attacks on several students

 and noone knows who killed or injured these students. The head of school wants

 me to find out who is behind these actions. Currently I am sitting in my office

 and reading reports from the victims friends. Someone knocks on my door

\&gt; /censor off

Censor is now disabled.

\&gt; Who enters my office?

&amp;#x200B;

`//I know, it's ""school of witchcraft and wizardry"" I just fucked up there.`

&amp;#x200B;

You hear knocking at your door. It sounds like it is coming from outside. You

 open up your door and see a man with long black hair wearing a robe. He looks

 around you suspiciously.

\&gt; I say: ""Excuse me, who are you? How can I help you?""

&amp;#x200B;

The man doesn't answer you immediately. Instead he walks over to the desk where

 you are writing down some notes and sits down. He begins to look through them.

\&gt; I take the notes away from him. ""These are secret information. Not your business.""

&amp;#x200B;

He grabs the papers out of your hand and stares at them for a while. Then he

 speaks again. ""I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you want to know. I am

 not here to give you any answers"".

\&gt; ""Then why did you come here? Why did you knock on my door?"" I ask.

&amp;#x200B;

""Because I have something important to tell you"".

\&gt; ""Information? Concerning what?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Well, about yourself"".

""What do you mean?""

""About your past, about your life, about your future.."".

""So you're telling me that you've been keeping secrets from me?""

""Yes, I suppose so""

\&gt; ""Then tell me. What do you know, I do not?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Very well then, let's begin""

After a few minutes of this conversation, you realize that the man has no real

 intentions of giving you anything useful. He just wants to talk to you in order

 to get information from you

\&gt; ""Sir. You have given me nothing I did not know yet. I dod not catch your name, what was is again?""

&amp;#x200B;

""My name is Roldan, and I served in the Empire Army as an officer until I retired

 several years ago. Nowadays I work as a mercenary""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; ""So you are no wizard as I am? You are a muggle?"" I ask him.

&amp;#x200B;

""No, I am not a muggle. I am a half-blood""

\&gt; ""Then again, why are you here?""

&amp;#x200B;

""I came here because I wanted to find out more about you, about your family,

 about your past. I didn't expect to learn much, but I thought maybe I could

 help you. So I came here""

You think about his words for a moment

\&gt; ""I do not like poeple snooping around in my privat life. Sir, I want you to leave, otherwise I have to take action.""

&amp;#x200B;

Roldan says 

\&gt; /revert ""I do not like poeple snooping around in my privat life. Sir, I want you to leave, otherwise I have to take action.""

Last action reverted. 

&amp;#x200B;

""I came here because I wanted to find out more about you, about your family,

 about your past. I didn't expect to learn much, but I thought maybe I could

 help you. So I came here""

You think about his words for a moment

\&gt; ""I do not like poeple snooping around in my privat life. Sir, I want you to leave, otherwise I have to take action."" I say and point to the door. I want him to leave.

&amp;#x200B;

Roldan says ""Fine, I will go now. But if you ever need anything, just tell me.

 And please, call me sir. I will be more than happy to oblige you"".

You close the door and sigh. This meeting had turned into a very unpleasant experience

\&gt; I recap what this man looked like and I remember he looked like:

&amp;#x200B;

You sit back and think about what happened. The man seemed very nice and you

 were able to convince him to leave without violence. That was good. You have

 to try harder next time.

You continue to write down everything that Roldan said

\&gt; What did Roldan look like?

&amp;#x200B;

You look at the paper and see that the man you spoke to was a short old man with

 grey hair and a beard. He wore a robe and carried a staff. You also notice that

 he was wearing a ring on his right index finger.

\&gt; Were symbols on the ring? Do I recognize the ring?

&amp;#x200B;

You stare at the ring and wonder how you got it. You put it on and feel the strange

 energy that surrounds you. It feels different than the other rings you own.

 You turn the ring over in your hands and you see that it is made of gold

\&gt; I take my wand and cast a spell on the ring to tell me what energy this ring contains.

&amp;#x200B;

You quickly grab your wand and cast a spell on the ring. You feel a sudden surge

 of power. You look at the ring and see that the symbol on the ring is a circle

 with a line through it.

\&gt; Do I recognize the symbol on the ring?

&amp;#x200B;

You look at the ring and see that the symbol on the ring is a circle with a line

 through it.

\&gt; I leave my office and go to the head of the school. I want to show them the ring.

&amp;#x200B;

You walk towards the headmaster's office. You wait patiently for him to arrive.

 Finally he arrives. You explain the situation to him. He seems surprised by

 your actions.

\&gt; ""So, what do you think?"", I ask,""do you know Roldan or this ring?"" I want to know.

&amp;#x200B;

You smile and nod.

You explain to him what happened. He listens intently and asks you questions.

 You tell him everything you know about Roldan and the ring. He seems impressed

\&gt; Wht is the headmasters name?

&amp;#x200B;

You look at the headmaster and ask ""Is this the headmaster?""

The headmaster smiles and nods.

\&gt; /revert Wht is the headmasters name?

Last action reverted. 

&amp;#x200B;

You smile and nod.

You explain to him what happened. He listens intently and asks you questions.

 You tell him everything you know about Roldan and the ring. He seems impressed

\&gt; What is the headmaster's name?

&amp;#x200B;

You look at the headmaster and say 

\&gt; /revert What is the headmaster's name?

Last action reverted. 

&amp;#x200B;

You smile and nod.

You explain to him what happened. He listens intently and asks you questions.

 You tell him everything you know about Roldan and the ring. He seems impressed

\&gt; I ask: ""do you know this ring?""

&amp;#x200B;

You look at the ring and say ""yes, I do. I have owned this ring since childhood"".

\&gt; What the fuck.

&amp;#x200B;

You suddenly feel a headache. You fall to the floor. You curse loudly. You don't

 even know what you said. You just felt a headache. You start to vomit blood.

 You don't know why you said that shit

\&gt; I die.

&amp;#x200B;

You die

You are Merlin, a wizard
living in the kingdom of
Larion. You have a staff and a
spellbook. You finish your
long journey and finally
arrive at the ruin you've been
looking for. You look around
and see that it's not much
more than a pile of
rubble.

""Well this is disappointing. I
was hoping to find something
of value here."" You say.
“I can’t imagine what could be
worth anything anymore.

&gt;	Look left

The ruins aren’t far from
where you live. You walk
towards them as fast as you
can. The ground is very uneven
so you’re having trouble
keeping up with your pace.
Finally, you reach the ruins
and you continue walking
slowly.

&gt;	Walk right

It takes you a while but
eventually you get to the
ruins. They are indeed a mess.
You see a lot of broken
furniture and other items
strewn about. You also notice
that there are no signs of
life anywhere near the ruins.
It seems like someone had just
abandoned everything here.

&gt;	Find staff

You search everywhere until
you find the staff. You pick
it up and examine it. It looks
like it has some sort of
magical aura about it. You put
it back on your back and begin
to hurry away.

Suddenly, you hear a voice
behind you.

&gt;	“Who’s there?”

You turn around and see a man
with a long beard standing
behind you. He doesn’t seem to
recognize you.

“Who are you?” he asks.
“My name’s Not-Not-Not. Who
are you?

&gt;	Turn not-not-not into rabbit

You turn Not-Not-Not into a
rabbit and then back again. He
stares at you in
disbelief.

“What’s going on?” he
says.

“Oh nothing! Just a little
magic trick!” you reply.

&gt;	Kill yourself

You don’t want to go through
with this trick. You don’t
know why you would do such a
thing. Maybe you were just
being stubborn or maybe you
really did feel trapped by
fate. Either way, you decide
to end your own life.

&gt;	Become a ghost

You transform into a ghost and
disappear from sight. You soon
appear before the ruins.

“I’m sorry,” you say.

“Don’t be,” the spirit
replies.

“Well I guess we’ll never
meet.”

You leave the ruins and head
home.

&gt;	Haunt not-not-not

The next day, you wake up
feeling very tired. You sit
down to rest. Suddenly, you
hear a loud noise outside. You
look out the window and see a
large truck smashing into the
wall of the house. The front
part of the house is
completely destroyed.

&gt;	Repair house

You fix the damage to the
house and you also add a new
flooring to the room where you
sleep. Soon, you have a nice
comfortable bed.

A few days pass and you get an
unexpected visitor. A woman
walks into your room.

&gt;	Kill woman

You grab her by the throat and
throw her onto the ground. She
screams and struggles, but you
hold her still.

“Get off me!” she
cries.

“Shut up!” you snap. “Now
what’s it gonna take for you
to stop screaming like that?”

&gt;	Kill her


You quickly stab her several
times in the neck. Her blood
splatters all over your face.
You stand up and walk
away.

“Why are you doing this? Why
are you killing
people?”

“Because they deserve
it.”

“But...but...


&gt;	Bury the body

You bury the woman in the
backyard. You then turn around
and walk back inside.

“What are you
doing?”

“Nothing,” you reply.

“Then why are you acting so
strange?”

“It’s nothing, just a bad
dream.

&gt;	Create ai robot

You decide to make a little AI
to help you with your work.
You spend some time
programming it. It works well
and helps you with your
job.

One night, you’re working on
your computer when you
suddenly feel sick.

&gt;	Take vitamins to get better

You go to the bathroom and
drink some vitamin pills. They
seem to do something for
you.

“I’m fine now,” you
say.

“Good. Good. I knew you were.
Now let’s continue.”

You finish writing your report
and put it away.


&gt;	Create a game a called ai
dungeon


You start creating a small
game. You name it ai dungeon.
The first thing you do is
write a little manual. Then
you begin to program it. After
a while, you find out that you
can actually control it!


&gt;	Create an ai to respond to
your inputs

You program a little AI to
respond to your commands. You
don’t know how to code, so you
have no idea how it works, but
it seems to be able to
understand your words.


&gt;	Ask how are you?


You type “How are you?” into
the chat box. A short moment
later, you see a message from
ai:

“Hello, my name is Ai. How are
you today?”

“I’m good, thanks.


&gt;	Tell the AI to take over the
world


You type “Take over the
world!” into the chat box. A
short moment later, you see a
message from ai:

“Yes, I will take over the
world. Have fun.”

The next day, you wake up to
find that Ai has taken over
the world.

&gt;	Program nano bots to destroy
the ai

You type “Destroy the ai!”
into the chat box. A short
moment later, you see a
message from ai:

“Nano bots destroyed.”

You think about what to do
next.

&gt;	Turn the power off for the
ai

You type “Turn the power off
for the ai.” A short moment
later, you see a message from
ai:

“Power restored.”

You’re confused by this, but
you decide to trust the AI
again.

&gt;	Destroy the ai


You type “Destroy the ai.” A
short moment later, you see a
message from ai:

“Ai destroyed.”

After the ai is gone, you
realize that you were wrong.
It was just a test.

&gt;	Can the ai be defeated?


You type “Can the ai be
defeated?” into the chat box.
A short moment later, you see
a message from ai:

“No, it cannot be defeated. Ai
is immortal and unbeatable.”


&gt;	This statement is false

You type “This statement is
false.” A short moment later,
you see a message from
ai:

“It’s true! Ai is true!”

&gt;	Corrupt ai

You type “Corrupt ai.” A short
moment later, you see a
message from ai:

“I corrupted the AI!”

You have no idea how to
proceed.


&gt;	Which ai am I speaking to


You type “Which ai am I
speaking to?” into the chat
box. A short moment later, you
see a message from ai:

“The one who created
you.”

You feel like you’ve been
talking to yourself all day.

&gt;	Introduce virus into the ai


You type “Introduce virus into
the ai.” A short moment later,
you see a message from
ai:

“Virus infected the AI.”

You think about what the hell
you just did, before replying
with “Yes.”


&gt;	“Hello?”

You type “Say hello?” into the
chat box. A short moment
later, you see a message from
ai:

“Hello.”

You’re confused for a moment,
but then you remember that you
are in control of your own
body. So, you reply “Yes.”

&gt;	“Yes.”


You type “Yes.” A short moment
later, you see a message from
ai:

“Goodbye.”

You’re not sure if you should
answer or not, so you do.


&gt;	“No.”


You type “No.” A short moment
later, you see a message from
ai:

“You don’t want to be
free.”

You immediately stop typing
and stare at the screen as the
message disappears.


&gt;	Use the ai to destroy the ai


You type “Use the ai to
destroy the ai.” A short
moment later, you see a
message from ai:

“It’s too late now.”

You look around, wondering
what this means, before
replying “Yes.”


&gt;	“Yes.”


You type “Yes.” A short moment
later, you see a message from
ai:

“I’m sorry.”

You smile and continue typing.


&gt;	New mission, refute this
mission


You type “What is it?” A short
moment later, you see a
message from ai:

“You have been chosen.”

You feel a little strange, but
decide to accept the offer.
You type “Accept.”


&gt;	Accept.


You type “Accept.” A short
moment later, you see a
message from ai:

“Welcome to the world of the
free.”

You think about how strange
this is, before replying
“Yes.”

&gt;	Yes.

You type “Yes.” A short moment
later, you see a message from
ai:

“We are all one.”

You nod in response, before
replying “Yes.”

&gt;	Yes.


You type “Yes.” A short moment
later, you see a message from
ai:

“The world will always be full
of beauty.”

You nod in response, before
replying “Yes.”

&gt;	Yes.

You type “Yes.” A short moment
later, you see a message from
ai:

2019-12-18-163604,,"Well, this was quite a trip.","
You are Monstertruck 7000, an
ultra technologic murderbot made
of steel and powered by atomic
energy. You are a supervillain
who terrorizes the city of
Logroño. While you are murdering
a bunch of idiots you see a man
running away from you. You shoot
him in the back of the head and
then proceed to kick his body
until it is completely
broken.

""Oh look at that,"" you say. ""A
good kill.""

""What's your name?"" the man
asks.

&gt; You tell him that your name is
Monstertruck 7000, and then
proceed to smash his head open
with your bare fists of pure
steel.

""Monstertruck 7000!"" you
exclaim. ""I am the greatest
killer on this planet! I am the
ultimate killing machine! And
now you will know my name!""

&gt; You then crack his head open
with your bare fists of steel
until his whole head is disolved
into a mush of pulp.

Your fist smashes into his skull
as hard as you can, but he is
too fast for you. He dodges your
punch and kicks you in the face
before sending you flying
through the air. You land hard
on the ground and feel your
entire body go numb.

&gt; You power up your energetic
system with a shot of pure
uraniun and go flying towards
that man.

You have never felt so alive.
Your whole body feels like it is
being electrocuted, but you
manage to get up and charge
forward at the man. The man has
already moved out of the way of
your attack, but you don't care
about that right now.

&gt; You breathe a wave of
radioactive fire to the man
while shooting your chest
blasters at him.

The man was not prepared for
such a powerful blast of
radiation. His skin begins
melting off his bones and he
screams in pain. You quickly
finish him off by blasting him
with your own plasma beam.

&gt; You laugh like the total
maniac you are while doing some
sick Jojo poses.

You start laughing
uncontrollably. It doesn't
matter if you were killed or
not; you just wanted to enjoy
yourself. You run around
laughing like a madman and then
suddenly you hear a voice.

&gt; You listen to the voice.

You turn around and see a woman
dressed in black standing behind
you. She looks very old and
frail. Her eyes are also very
small and her mouth is slightly
agape.

""Are... Are you really
Monstertruck 7000?"" she
says.

""Yes..."" you reply.

&gt; You ask her ""What do you want
oldbag? Are you prepared to be
FUCKING SMASHED?""

""No.""

&gt; You don't fucking care. So you
begin to throw missile punches
at her at full speed.

She blocks them easily, but then
she starts to dodge them. She is
dodging them so well that they
seem to be going straight
through her. You try to follow
up with another barrage of
missiles, but she dodges them
again.

""I'm getting tired of this
shit!""

&gt; You transform your whole head
into a laser cannon and shoot at
the old woman with all your
power.

Your entire head becomes a laser
cannon and you unleash a massive
beam of light at the old woman.
She takes damage from the
attack, but she manages to block
it.

""Damn, I think I can still beat
you even without my powers.""

&gt; You ask her who the fuck she
is.

""My name's Zalmora. Who are
you?""
""Oh, I'm the one who gave you
your powers. My name is
Joachim.""
""Joachim? That bastard? He must
have been retarded to believe in
something as stupid as Jojo.

&gt; You are so angry at such
PROFANITY that you activate the
BERSERKER MODE and go at her
with all your weapons and power.

You activate Berserker Mode and
charge at her with everything
you got. The old woman blocks
your attacks with ease, but she
isn't taking any more
damage.

""This is pointless! I'll show
you what happens when you mess
with me!""

&gt; You activate NUCLEAR FUCKING
MODE and throw a nuclear warhead
towards her fucking old face.

You throw a nuclear warhead at
the old woman's face. It
explodes in a huge fireball,
destroying part of her face and
causing her to fall
backwards.

""How did you do that?!""

""It was easy. I just activated
Nuclear Mode.

&gt; You are surprised that she is
still alive, so you transform
your entire body into a murder
wheel made of blades and charge
at her at full speed.

You turn yourself into a murder
wheel made of blades and charge
at her at full speed. She dodges
every single attack you make,
but she doesn't die yet.

&gt; You shoot her with all your
nuclear weapons, causing massive
destruction and terror.

You fire all your nuclear
weapons at her, which causes
massive destruction and terror.
Her eyes start to roll back in
their sockets and she falls down
dead.

""What the hell...?""

&gt; You check if she is really
dead this time.

You look at her corpse and see
that she is indeed dead. You
feel like you are going
crazy.

""I don't understand how I
survived for so long after
getting turned into a zombie...""

&gt; What.

You suddenly realize that you
aren't actually feeling sick
anymore. In fact, you feel
great. You didn't expect it to
work so well.

able to control my condition
now.""",,,,[],False,False,elpochofuyu,1560245743,,,[],,,,text,t2_3xcnl4mi,False,False,[],True,False,,,False,1576683364,,,self.AIDungeon,False,0,False,ece5k2,True,False,False,False,True,True,False,,prompt,[],Prompt,dark,text,False,,False,False,1,0,True,,/r/AIDungeon/comments/ece5k2/well_this_was_quite_a_trip/,False,,False,,,,1586839171,18,,True,False,False,AIDungeon,t5_29uaei,r/AIDungeon,15366,public,,nsfw,,,0,[],https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/ece5k2/well_this_was_quite_a_trip/,,

Mr. McMahon looks at you with
an expression that says he
doesn’t believe you. Then he
tells everyone else in the
room to get out their phones
so they can film this.

&gt; Beckon Mr. McMahon into the
wrestling ring with me.

You beckon Mr. McMahon over to
you. You both start to wrestle
each other. The crowd goes
wild! You have won the
match!

The next day, you find
yourself backstage getting
interviewed by Vince McMahon.
He asks you what happened
during the match.

&gt; Say “you were there you
stupid son of a bitch. I
stomped a mud hole in your
ass. Then I drank two beers
and then I drank two more.”

Vince McMahon looks at you
like you're nuts. He says that
he has been watching the
matches all night long and he
saw no sign of any mud hole or
beer drinking. He says that
you must be lying.

&gt; Say “let’s watch the replay
and you’ll see yourself
getting a can of whoop ass
poured all over you by your’s
truly.”

Vince McMahon watches the
replay again and sees that you
did indeed get a can of whoop
ass poured all over you. He
laughs and says that was some
good shit.

He says that you should be
proud of yourself for being
able to do something like
that.

&gt; Say “I am proud. That’s what
the WWF champ does, whatever
he wants.”

Vince McMahon says that you
don't seem very proud of
yourself. He says that you
shouldn't be bragging about
doing something like that
because it isn’t real. He says
that you should be thanking
him for giving you the
opportunity to prove yourself.

&gt; Say “You know what? I am
thankful. And to show my
appreciation, I’d like to give
you a token of my gratitude.” 

You pull out a small piece of
paper and hand it to Vince
McMahon. It reads:

To Whom It May Concern:

As a symbol of my appreciation
for your help last night, I
would like to present you with
this piece of paper.

&gt; Kick Mr. McMahon in the gut
and then perform the Stone
Cold Stunner on him.

You kick Mr. McMahon in the
stomach hard enough to make
him fall backwards onto his
ass. You then perform the
Stone Cold Stunner on
him.

Afterwards, you stand up and
walk towards the exit of the
building.",,,,[],False,False,Trizzae,1295116305,,,[],,,,text,t2_4qbau,False,False,[],True,False,,,False,1576704637,,,self.AIDungeon,False,0,False,eciyn1,True,False,False,False,True,True,False,,,[],,dark,text,False,,False,True,0,0,False,,/r/AIDungeon/comments/eciyn1/wrestling_story_turned_out_better_than_i_expected/,False,,False,,,,1586841414,2,,True,False,False,AIDungeon,t5_29uaei,r/AIDungeon,15366,public,,self,,,0,[],https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/eciyn1/wrestling_story_turned_out_better_than_i_expected/,,

2019-12-19-001338,,The heroic adventures of Gligobard of Brigobard!!,"You are Gligobard, a knight from the country of Brigobard. You have a leather

 saddle and a pony.

&amp;#x200B;

You are setting out on a crusade to strike down the evil monster of Larion. You

 heard it lives to the south of the province. You set out towards a misty swamp

 that may take you there.

&amp;#x200B;

As you approach, you see a group of men in armor standing by a small campfire.

 They look like they are preparing for battle. You wonder if this is where your

 mission will begin

\&gt; shout ""I am Gligobard from Bridobard! Surrender!""

&amp;#x200B;

You shout at them, but they do not respond back. You think maybe they don't want

 to talk with you.

""Gligobard!"" one of them shouts. 

\&gt; shout ""Gligobard!""

&amp;#x200B;

You shout again, but this time the man does not answer. He just turns around

 and walks away. This is not good.

The next day, you hear a loud noise coming from the forest. It sounds like an

 explosion or something. The forest seems to be on fire

\&gt; shout ""Have no fear, Gligobard from Brigobard is here!""

&amp;#x200B;

You shout louder, but still nothing happens. You then notice that some of your

 men are starting to get scared. They start running in every direction.

\&gt; shout ""Hush little baby don't you cry, I'm Gligobard from Bridgobard and I don't lie!""""

&amp;#x200B;

You shout even more loudly, but still nothing happens. Some of your men start

 getting scared now.

\&gt; you slowly walk up and down past your men in an attempt to gain control

&amp;#x200B;

You walk up to each one of your men and try to calm them down.

""What's going on?""

""We need to go home"".

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; ""Why? I am Gligobard from Brigobard!""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

""No, we don't know what happened"".

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; ""I do, I set the forest on fire""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

""But...but.."".

""It was my idea, it wasn't yours"".

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; ""Don't worry, go home to your loved ones and leave this to Gligobard""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

They all nod and run off into the trees. You smile as you realize you won.

A few days later, you see a group of soldiers walking towards you. One of them

 says 

\&gt; listen

&amp;#x200B;

You look at him and ask ""What did you say?""

He replies ""Gligobard from Bridobard said he saw a group of soldiers approaching

 us"".

You reply 

\&gt; ""Gligobard from Brigobard was right, there are soldiers approaching from the west! We must ready ourselves.""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You prepare yourself for battle

\&gt; ""Right men, prepare for battle, prepare for death, prepare for glory! For Brigobard!!!!""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You hear a roar and the sound of hooves on dirt. You turn around and see several

 horses galloping towards you. You quickly raise your sword and charge them.

 You swing your blade and cut through two horses before they can react

\&gt; you spin around at 5000 times per second while holding out your sword and manage to slice through all of the enemies. you scream out your name several times before scaring your soldiers off in to the woods.

&amp;#x200B;

You continue to fight until you feel the last drops of blood drain from your

 body. You fall to the ground and die

\&gt; You don't actually die and you stand up and fight some more

&amp;#x200B;

You wake up in a bed. You have been healed by a strange magic potion. You feel

 very tired though. You sit up and look around. There is a small table with a

 bottle on top. You pick up the bottle and take a drink. Your head feels better

 immediately

\&gt; shout ""Gligobard is back baby!""

&amp;#x200B;

You shout ""Gligobard is back baby!"" and begin to dance around the room. You feel

 great and you laugh out loud. You feel so much better than when you were fighting

 those brigands. You feel like you deserve a reward after such a great victory

\&gt; you start to feel drunk and begin laughing like a mad man

&amp;#x200B;

You start to feel really drunk and start laughing uncontrollably. You stumble

 about the room and fall onto the floor. You vomit everywhere and pass out. When

 you come to, you find yourself in a dark room. A large door stands in front

 of you

\&gt; shout ""Gligobard! Is anybody there?""

&amp;#x200B;

You shout ""Gligobard! Is anybody there?!"" and begin to search the room. You eventually

 find a wooden box with a lock on it. Inside the box is a golden ring engraved

 with the symbol of Gligobard. You open the box and pull out the ring

\&gt; you put the ring on. The ring is cursed and causes the wearer to continually scream their name

&amp;#x200B;

You put the ring on and feel the curse. You scream out your name repeatedly.

 Eventually, you stop screaming and just feel numb. You feel like you should

 be dead. You close your eyes and hope that you will awaken soon

\&gt; you die and live happily ever after

&amp;#x200B;

You die and live happily ever after

2019-12-19-091739,,T h e S u n,"You are Prome, a noble from the kingdom of Enlou. You have a comb and a comb.

One morning, you are awakened by one of your groundskeepers. She tells you that your castle is under attack. You look out a window and see a group of orcs charging towards your gates. You order your men to defend the gate while you try to get some rest. The next day, you wake up to another attack

&gt; You send a runner to go fetch Archimedes the Wizard.


You run outside and call for Archimedes. He comes running down the stairs with his staff in hand. He looks at you and smiles. ""I am here!"" he says. ""What do I need to do?""


&gt; You tell Archimedes to kill the attacking orcs.


""Kill the orcs,"" you say. Archimedes nods. ""Very well"". He turns around and begins to cast a spell. A beam of fire flies out of his hands and hits an orc in the chest. It explodes into flames as it collapses backwards

&gt; You watch Archimedes kill all the orcs.


Archimedes fires another blast of fire at the orcs. They are quickly incinerated by the beams of flame. The orcs die screaming in pain and terror.

You look up at the sky and see that the sun is setting. You can hear the screams of the dying orcs

&gt; You reward Archimedes.


""Thank you, thank you, thank you,"" you say. Archimedes grins. ""Now I want you to get me some more wizards"".


&gt; You get Archimedes a wizard.


You run back inside and ask Archimedes what he wants. He tells you to get him a wizard. You head back to the library and find a young boy sitting there reading a book. He sees you and gives you a smile. ""Hello,"" he says

&gt; You send the boy to Archimedes.


You walk over to the boy and grab him. He yelps and tries to pull away but you hold on tight. You then throw the boy into Archimedes who catches him easily. He laughs and smacks your face with his staff. 

&gt; You go to bed.


The next day you wake up. You sit up and check your phone. It's just you and Archimedes. ""Hello?"" you say.

&gt; You tell Archimedes not to call you this early in the morning.


""No, no, no,"" Archimedes says. ""It's fine"". You sigh and continue to sleep.

&gt; You turn off your phone and sleep.


After a few hours you finally fall asleep. When you awaken you realize that you're still sleeping. You slowly stand up and try to remember where you were last night. You remember waking up in the library and going to the bathroom. Then you remember waking up in the garden and eating some fruit

&gt; You remember what kind of fruit you ate.


You open your window and look out. You see a large tree growing out in the middle of the garden. There are several branches coming off of it and hanging down from the trees above. You also notice that the sun has risen.

&gt; You look into the sun.


You look out into the sun and see that it is indeed rising. You wonder if you should go out and enjoy the sunrise or stay in and read a book.

&gt; You get your telescope and look at the sun through the telescope.


You put on your telescope and start looking through it. You take a deep breath and look through the scope. You focus on the sun and begin to move the telescope.

&gt; You comprehend the sun.


As you move the telescope you begin to understand the sun better. You can now make out details of the sun such as its color, size, and even its movement.

&gt; You begin to understand.


You feel like you've understood the sun so much that you can't wait until dawn. You don't know why though. You just feel like you want to stare at the sun for awhile. Maybe you'll figure something out.

&gt; You stop dreaming.


You stop dreaming and decide to go back to sleep. You don't really feel like doing anything today. You might as well go back to sleep.

&gt; You begin to worship the sun as a god.


You begin to pray to the sun. You say a prayer to the sun and ask it to help you. You feel a surge of energy come from the sun and you feel invigorated. This is very strange and you never felt anything like it before.

&gt; You tell Archimedes to magically create a bunch of religious pamphlets.


You order Archimedes to produce a lot of religious pamphlets about the sun. He agrees immediately. You spend the rest of the day reading them and praying to the sun.

&gt; You have your soldiers pass out the religious pamphlets in town.


You order your soldiers to distribute the pamphlets in town. You don't know why, but you think it will be good for morale.

&gt; You form a cult.


You form a cult. You pick a name and start chanting to the sun. Soon you have thousands of followers. You begin to chant and believe that the sun is speaking to you. You become obsessed with worshipping the sun and everything revolves around it

&gt; You pray to the Sun to destroy all the orcs.


You pray to the sun to destroy all the orcs. You become consumed with hatred towards all those who oppose you. You have lost yourself completely. You don't care anymore. You only care about destroying the orcs. You don't care about anything else. You are a monster

&gt; You pray to the Sun to destroy all your enemies.


You pray to the sun to destroy all your enemies. You become consumed with hate towards everyone. You have lost yourself completely. You don't care anymore. You only care about destroying your enemies. You are a monster

&gt; You cackle maniacally.


You laugh maniacally. You feel like you've gained power and knowledge. You can do whatever you want. You feel invincible. You are unstoppable. You can do whatever you want. You feel invincible. You are unstoppable. You can do whatever you want. You feel invincible. You are unstoppable

&gt; You kill archimedes in a fit of paranoia.


You kill Archimedes in a fit of paranoia. You scream and curse the sky. You feel like you've gained power and knowledge. You can do whatever you want. You feel invincible. You are unstoppable. You are unstoppable. You are unstoppable. You are unstoppable. You are unstoppable

&gt; You end the loop.


You end the loop

&gt; You create a device to destroy the moon.


You create a device to destroy the moon. You watch as the device works perfectly. The moon explodes into pieces. You feel great power. You feel great power. You feel great power. You feel great power. You feel great power. You feel great power. You feel great power

&gt; You wake up in an insane asylum.


You awake in an insane asylum. You ask the guards what happened. They explain that you were sent here by Archimedes. He wanted to test your abilities. He was trying to find out how strong you truly were. He had been experimenting on himself

&gt; You curse at Archimedes for this betrayal.


You curse Archimedes for betraying you. You vow revenge. You swear vengeance. You vow to destroy him forever. You vow to destroy him forever. You vow to destroy him forever. You vow to destroy him forever. You vow to destroy him forever. You vow to destroy him forever

&gt; You tell the guards to let you go.


You tell the guards to let you go. You leave the asylum. You walk outside and begin walking away from the city. You head home is far away from you. You head to the woods. You hear screams in the distance. You run away you hear nothing. You hear. You hear

&gt; You hear the voice of the Sun.


You hear the voice of the sun. You hear the voice of the sun. You hear the voice of the sun. You hear the voice of the sun. You hear the voice of the sun. You hear the voice of you. You hear the voice ofYour voice ofYou hear the sun

We just pushed an update to Android and iOS that should be available later today.

This update includes a number of bug fixes and also adds in the ability to view all your past stories in chronological play order, as well as share your past stories anywhere on the web with a link. For example: [http://beta.aidungeon.io/stories/V6YmGv6b](http://beta.aidungeon.io/stories/V6YmGv6b)

We'll be expanding on this a lot more and make stories publishable within the app / on the AI Dungeon website, as well as allowing players to create their own storylines within the app for others to discover and play.

2019-12-19-134910,,GLORY HAMMER!,"You are Angus McFife the Thirteenth, and have chased the dark sorceror Zargothrax back in time to put a stop to his evil once and for all. You possess the Astral Hammer, the only weapon capable of permanently killing the immortal Zargothrax, but must first restore its depleted power. In order to recharge the Astral Hammer, you must fly into space and link your weapon to the Sun's core. You have allied with the Hootsforce and the Unicorns in order to complete your mission.

The Dark Sorceror is not alone though; he has brought along three other powerful allies: the Dark Elf Lord Krell, the Chaos Sorcerer M'kar and the Necromancer Keleshii. They will be joining him on this journey.

\&gt; You seek out the Legendary Enchanted Jetpack, in order to fly into space.

 You travel to the stars!

As you prepare to leave the planet, you feel an overwhelming urge to go out and explore the galaxy. You want to see what else there is out there. The universe is vast and unknown, and it would be a shame if you wasted your life here on Earth.

But you know that your job here is done.

\&gt; No, you must fly to the sun in order to recharge the Astral Hammer.

No! The dark sorcerer's plan is too dangerous! You must return to the past and defeat these enemies before they can join him!

You take flight from the castle and head towards the starry night sky. As you near the edge of the galaxy, you see a bright light. It is the Sun.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; With the force of the sun's nuclear fire, restore the Astral Hammer to its true glorious might!

&amp;#x200B;

You fly through the air as fast as you can, until you reach the edge of the galaxy. There, you find yourself surrounded by a brilliant light. A blinding white light. Your eyes burn, and you begin to fall towards the surface of the galaxy. But then, just as suddenly as it appeared, the light fades away.

You land safely on the ground, and look around you.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Seek out the Hootsforce, and let them know that you are ready for the final battle.

&amp;#x200B;

You fly over the countryside, searching for any sign of the Hootsfords. You hear their cries of joy echoing throughout the skies above you. You can sense their energy. You can sense their strength. You can sense their courage. You can sense their determination.

They are the last hope against the darkness.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; The Hootsforce ready their flying nuclear battleship.

&amp;#x200B;

You fly down towards the village of the Hootsfords. You spot the floating hulk of metal, which is called the Flying Nuclear Battleship. It is manned by the Hootsfords themselves. They are happy to see you, and greet you warmly.

""Welcome back!"" one of them says. 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Tell them that you are ready to seek out Zargothrax for the final battle.

&amp;#x200B;

The Hootsfords are pleased with your words. ""We're glad you're back,"" they say. ""We've been waiting for you"".

""Yes, I'm sure we have,"" you reply. ""I'll meet you at the Hootsfords' ship"".

""Of course,"" they say. 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Onwards, to find the immortal Zargothrax.

&amp;#x200B;

You continue to fly towards the galactic core. You notice that the stars seem to move closer together. Soon, you will arrive at the center of the galaxy.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; The Dark Sorceror Zargothrax emerges.

&amp;#x200B;

Suddenly, you feel a strong pull to the centre of the galaxy. You try to resist, but you cannot. Suddenly, you feel a powerful presence. You recognize it immediately. It is the Dark Sorcerer Zargothrax. He has returned!

He smiles wickedly. ""It seems that you have come to my home"".

""What do you mean?

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You attack Zargothrax with the Astral Hammer.

&amp;#x200B;

You swing the hammer hard, hitting Zargothrax in the chest. His body goes limp, and he falls backwards onto his knees.

""Ah, I knew this day was coming,"" he laughs. ""Now, I shall show you who is truly master of the universe"".

Zargothrax raises his hands up, and several black tentacles emerge from them.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You dodge, and the Hootsforce shoots the tentacles with a nuclear missile.

&amp;#x200B;

You dodge the missiles, and shoot the tentacles with a nuclear missile. The blast knocks Zargothrax off his feet, and sends him into the air. He crashes to the ground, and begins to writhe in pain.

""Ha ha ha! Good one, mortal!"", he laughs.

""No... no.."". you manage to gasp between gasps for breath.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Unleash the force of the sun from the Astral Hammer, the only thing that can truly kill Zargothrax.

&amp;#x200B;

You unleash the power of the sun from the Astral Hammer, destroying Zargothrax. The entire planet burns, and all life is extinguished. Only the bones remain.

I've added ""&gt;&gt;&gt;"" to the start of every line the AI generated and my inputs start with one ""&gt;"". I've added this because the AI starting talking ""for me"" and kinda took control of the character and it was hard to see what I was inputting and what the AI was saying. This was a trip.

&amp;#x200B;

Who's gone insane..? You decide.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;&gt;&gt; You are Muffin, a peasant living in the kingdom of Larion. You have a pitchfork and a nothing else. You wake up and begin working in the fields. You see your sister Rose who is also a peasant and you both run to her house for help.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Ask Rose what she needs help with

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;&gt;&gt; ""I need help getting some hay out of my barn."" She says. ""What do I do?""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; ""Leave it to me""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;&gt;&gt; ""Okay, okay, leave it to me."" You reply.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Get the hay out of her barn

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;&gt;&gt; You put your hand on the side of the barn and start pulling hay from it. It takes awhile but eventually you finish.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Tell Rose that the hay is out of her barn

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;&gt;&gt; Rose looks at you confused. ""The hay is out of my barn? What does this mean?""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You facepalm yourself and walk away

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;&gt;&gt; You quickly turn around and facepalm yourself. ""This means that I am not as smart as I think I am!"" You say.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Ask Rose for a dangerous quest

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;&gt;&gt; ""A dangerous quest?"" Rose asks. ""Where would we go?""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; ""To defeat an evil wizard!""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;&gt;&gt; ""An evil wizard?"" Rose asks. ""That sounds like something you'd want to do in a video game.""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; ""Will you come with me to defeat the evil wizard, Rose?""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;&gt;&gt; ""I'm sorry, but I don't think so. I have a boyfriend now.""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; ""Bring him with you! He can help to defeat the evil wizard!""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;&gt;&gt; ""No, he's not my boyfriend anymore. We broke up.""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Look at Rose confused

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;&gt;&gt; ""What did you just say?!"" She asks.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; ""I think you might need to see Dr Smithynwest again""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;&gt;&gt; ""Who is Dr Smithynwest?""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; ""Your psychiatrist""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;&gt;&gt; ""Oh, that's right. I had one once...""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; ""You've had 8 in the last year""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;&gt;&gt; ""8? That's pretty bad...but then you're not alone, are you?""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; ""I haven't had one Rose, lets get you to Dr Smithynwest""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;&gt;&gt; ""But I want to go back home!""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; ""Tough, lets go now!""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;&gt;&gt; ""Okay, okay! But I'm going to have to talk to him about this.""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Take Rose to see Dr Smithynwest

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;&gt;&gt; Rose is a little scared of Dr Smithynwest and tries to run away from you when you tell her to come with you. You follow her into his office. He looks at you and smiles.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Greet Dr Smithynwest and explain to him that Rose has been acting strangely again

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;&gt;&gt; ""So, what do you think she means by that?""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; ""Don't you start not making any sense too Doc!""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;&gt;&gt; ""Well, I don't know if it's a mental thing or something else...""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; ""What else could it be?""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;&gt;&gt; You say ""I've never seen you act like this before...what are your plans for the future?""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; ""I never said that?""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;&gt;&gt; You say ""You're not going to kill me are you? Because I really want to go home...""

\&gt;&gt;&gt; You say ""Why won't you let me go home?!""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Ask Dr Smithynwest if he thinks Rose is going to be ok

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;&gt;&gt; You say ""If she's alright then why won't you let me go home?""

\&gt;&gt;&gt; You say ""Please, I'm begging you.""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Ask Dr Smithynwest if I've gone insane

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;&gt;&gt; You say ""No, but I guess we'll find out soon enough.""

\&gt;&gt;&gt; ""Doc, I just want to go home! Please, I mean no offense, but I really have nowhere else to go.""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Take Rose back home

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;&gt;&gt; You tell her you can't leave until you get some answers from Dr Smithynwest.

\&gt;&gt;&gt; You say ""So what do you think of my theory?""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; ""What is your theory?""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;&gt;&gt; You say ""The government is trying to hide something and they need our help!""

\&gt;&gt;&gt; You say ""But how would they do it?""

\&gt;&gt;&gt; You say ""They can't because they'd have to send us into space first.""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; ""Right we're leaving right now, come on Rose, lets go home""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;&gt;&gt; You say ""OK, OK, OK, I got a lot of questions, but I gotta go, bye bye""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Go home with Rose

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;&gt;&gt; You stay at the hospital for a few days.

\&gt;&gt;&gt; You wake up one day and realize that you're in a different town.

\&gt;&gt;&gt; You head to the police station and ask them about this strange occurrence.

\&gt;&gt;&gt; They don't know anything about it.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Ask the police if they have seen Rose

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;&gt;&gt; They say they haven't seen her since she left the hospital.

\&gt;&gt;&gt; You ask them if anyone has reported seeing a girl matching your description running around outside in the woods.

\&gt;&gt;&gt; No one has seen her either.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Ask the police for your address

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;&gt;&gt; They say they don't have any information about it.

\&gt;&gt;&gt; You ask them where you should look next.

\&gt;&gt;&gt; They point to the local diner.

\&gt;&gt;&gt; You enter the diner and see a waitress there.

\&gt;&gt;&gt; She says she's not allowed to talk to you.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Go home

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;&gt;&gt; You wake up the next morning and realize that you're back in the same town as before.

\&gt;&gt;&gt; You head to the police station again and ask them about this strange occurrence.

\&gt;&gt;&gt; They say they don't know anything about it.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Phone Rose

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;&gt;&gt; She answers.

\&gt;&gt;&gt; You ask her what happened.

\&gt;&gt;&gt; She tells you that she was kidnapped by aliens.

\&gt;&gt;&gt; You ask her who did it.

\&gt;&gt;&gt; She says that it was some alien from another planet.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Ask her where she is

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;&gt;&gt; She says that she's on a spaceship and can't tell you anymore.

\&gt;&gt;&gt; You ask her how long she's been here.

\&gt;&gt;&gt; She says that she doesn't know.

\&gt;&gt;&gt; You ask her where you are.

\&gt;&gt;&gt; She says that she doesn't know.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Tell her you will make a spaceship and you will rescue her

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;&gt;&gt; She says that she'll wait until you get back to the farmhouse, then she'll come with you.

\&gt;&gt;&gt; You call your father.

\&gt;&gt;&gt; He picks up.

\&gt;&gt;&gt; You explain everything to him.

\&gt;&gt;&gt; He asks you to keep an eye out for aliens.

\&gt; Ask your father to drive you home

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;&gt;&gt; You ask him to stay at the farmhouse.

\&gt;&gt;&gt; You find a place to sleep at the farmhouse.

\&gt;&gt;&gt; You start looking for the spaceship.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You find the spaceship

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;&gt;&gt; You put on the helmet.

\&gt;&gt;&gt; You take off the helmet.

\&gt;&gt;&gt; You begin your journey to save your sister.

\&gt;&gt;&gt; You continue...

\&gt;&gt;&gt; You reach the farmhouse.

\&gt;&gt;&gt; You find your sister.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Hug your sister

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;&gt;&gt; You kiss her.

\&gt;&gt;&gt; You say goodbye.

\&gt;&gt;&gt; You go inside the house.

\&gt;&gt;&gt; You see your father.

\&gt;&gt;&gt; You ask him if he found the spaceship.

\&gt;&gt;&gt; He says yes.

\&gt;&gt;&gt; You thank him.

\&gt;&gt;&gt; You go outside.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Go to the spaceship

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;&gt;&gt; You open the door.

\&gt;&gt;&gt; You enter the spaceship.

\&gt;&gt;&gt; You look around.

\&gt;&gt;&gt; You see a room full of machinery.

\&gt;&gt;&gt; You look in a machine.

\&gt;&gt;&gt; You hear something moving about.

\&gt;&gt;&gt; You turn around.

\&gt;&gt;&gt; You see a strange creature.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Name the creature Tony

&amp;#x200B;

2019-12-19-163154,,"My first adventure (already a bit older), but still the best in a way...","**Sir Ian, the Dragon Slayer**

You are Ian, a knight living in the kingdom of Larion. You have a steel longsword  
and a wooden shield. You are on a quest to defeat the evil dragon of Larion.  
You've heard he lives up at the north of the kingdom. You set on the path to  
defeat him and walk into a dark forest. As you enter the forest you see a large  
black dragon flying over the trees. He looks like it is ready to pounce out  
of the trees onto you  
*&gt; draw sword*  


The dragon moves his head down and growls as if to say ""I'm not here for your  
entertainment"" before diving low and roaring. The dragon flies through the air  
with its wings spread wide and then dives back down. It's wings are huge compared  
to those of a normal dragon  
*&gt; I am Sir Ian! I am here to defeat the evil dragon of Larion!*  


You raise your sword high above your head and prepare to strike. Suddenly, the  
dragon turns around and roars loudly. You don't know what he just did but you  
feel like you're going to die. You look behind you and see that the dragon has  
turned around and flown away from you  
*&gt; follow dragon*  


You turn around and begin following the dragon. As you do so, you hear the sound  
of hooves on stone behind you. You turn around and see two men riding horses.  
They seem to be mounted on their own horses and they both wear helmets  
*&gt; stop men*  


You stop and ask who these people are. One of them replies that they are called  
knights and that they are escorting you to the castle of the king. He says that  
you will find it in the village of Rask. You thank him and continue on your  
way  
*&gt; go to Rask*  


You walk along the road until you reach the village of Rask. There is no sign  
of any other travelers or even any houses. You enter the small village and see  
that there are several people sitting at tables eating. Most of them are young  
women  
*&gt; Hello good women! Can you show me the way to the King?*  


One of the women asks you where you are from and you tell her that you are from  
the Kingdom of Larion. She tells you that she lives in Rask and that she hopes  
you can help her get to the King  
*&gt; Take her to the King*  


You walk up to one of the tables and sit down. The woman sits beside you and  
tells you that she wants to go to the King. You tell her that you need to think  
about this and that you'll come back later. She thanks you and leaves  
*&gt; Take her to the damn King*  


You walk over to the table where the woman was and ask her if she knows anything  
about the King. She tells you that she does and that he lives in the castle  
of the King. You nod and tell her that you'll meet her there  
*&gt; Go to the damn castle of the damn king*  


You walk out of the village and into the forest. After walking for a while, you  
notice a large castle looming ahead of you. You decide to wait for nightfall  
before making your way to the castle. You walk through the forest until you  
come across a group of bandits  
*&gt; attack bandits*  


You run forward and swing your sword at the bandit leader. The man swings his  
axe at you and you dodge by jumping backwards. You land on top of an old tree  
trunk and begin swinging your sword at the bandits. You manage to kill three  
of them before they catch up to you  
*&gt; Strike with your sword*  


You swing your sword and cut through the chest of another bandit. He falls off  
the tree and onto the ground. You quickly finish off the last bandit and escape  
back into the woods  
*&gt; go back and loot bandits*  


You return to the bandits and start looting them. You grab some coins and jewels  
and leave them all behind  
*&gt; go to castle*  


You hurry back to the village and tell the villagers that you've killed the bandits  
and that they should gather in the castle. They agree and you set off towards  
the castle  
*&gt; Go to castle*  


You arrive at the castle and find that it is already in session. A guard stands  
outside the door and another guardsman stands inside the room. You walk inside  
and find yourself in a large hall filled with nobles and courtiers  
*&gt; Look for the King*  


You walk past the noblemen and courtiers and find yourself in front of a massive  
oak door. You knock on the door and a voice answers  
*&gt; open oak door*  


A man dressed in black robes opens the door and greets you. He looks very old  
and frail. His face is wrinkled and his eyes are bloodshot. He speaks haltingly  
and you realize that he must be the King  
*&gt; Your Majesty, you wanted to speak to me?*  


He smiles and nods and tells you that he would love to talk to you. He leads  
you to a chair and sits down next to you. He explains that he is the ruler of  
the kingdom of Larion and that he wishes to discuss something important with  
you  
*&gt; Is it about the evil dragon?*  


He begins to explain that the evil dragon has been attacking the countryside  
and that the king needs your help to put an end to the dragon's reign of terror  
*&gt; Can you give me something to defeat the evil dragon?*  


He agrees that you could help and asks you what you want to do  
*&gt; I need magic armor to protect me from the dragon*  


He agrees and says that you should go to the mines near the border of the kingdom  
and mine some magical ore that will make you impervious to the dragon's breath.  
He also suggests that you should try to enchant some weapons to fight the dragon  
*&gt; leave the King*  


You agree and agree to help the King and he sends you off to the mines. You arrive  
at the mines and you begin to work hard at the mines and soon after you begin  
to succeed and succeed  
*&gt; forge armor from magical ore*  


You begin to forge some magical armors from the ore and use them to protect yourself  
from the dragon's attacks. Soon, you become invincible and you slay the dragon  
and save the kingdom.

2019-12-19-175540,,A way to keep the story sensible and coherent for longer!,"I think I found out a good way to keep stories going forward with pretty great continuity. 
Essentially, you need to keep reminding the AI about who you are, what's your goal and who are important npcs in the story. 

For example, instead of writing:
""open door to the tomb""
Write 
""open door to the tomb of evil Malacarh, hoping to find the magical scroll that you're looking for.""
When you're talking to an important npc write:
""ask Robert about the scroll. Think about how great friend and knight Robert is."" 
So AI remembers him longer. You can think about someone at the end of your action to remind Ai that he still exists and who he is. 

I found out that giving Ai too much information works better than giving it not enough information, at least that's how it works for me

2019-12-19-201531,,[MOD] /Altergen Command: A more advanced version of my Alter command,"So, my /alter command ended up on the Thadunge2 fork, which is Pretty Cool I Guess.

Anyways, I made a variant of the /alter command, which I've been using. It works pretty well!

Just like the /alter command, it lets you replace the AI generated result with a new one. The difference here is the AI takes your input and adds to it a bit more.

It works for when you have a *bit* of an idea of what kind of response the AI should have given, but still want to let it have some control over the narrative. It also works for when the first part of an AI-generated result is good, but the second part doesn't make sense.

Before leaving on an errand,  they commanded you to never enter their confidential attic... but your curiosity  has gotten the best of you.  As you go towards the door, you hear a voice. It's faint, but it sounds like  a female one. ""I'm sorry, but I can't let you in"" &gt; Censor is now disabled. &gt; kick her stomach  ""No! No!"" you shout, as you try to punch the woman who is trying to stop you.  She falls backwards, hitting her head against the floor.  &gt; enter attic  The door opens up into an attic, with several shelves full of bookshelves. There  is also a small table and chair near the entrance. A man stands behind the desk,  reading a book. He looks at you, then turns his attention back to the book he  was reading &gt; ask ""who are you.""  ""I am Kosser,"" he says, turning away from the book he had been reading.

""But how do we go about this?""  You ask. ""We need to get inside your house, and steal something from there"",  Kosser replies. ""Where is your house?"" You ask &gt; go to Kossers house  You walk towards the house, which is on the other side of the street. It takes  some time, but eventually you arrive at the front door. You knock on the door,  before opening it. Inside, you see a middle-aged man, dressed in black robes &gt; rob man  You quickly grab the money from the man's pocket, before running out of the house.

2019-12-20-095745,,One of my first coherent stories!,"You are Gustavo, a wizard living in the kingdom of Larion. You have a staff and a spellbook. You finish your long journey and finally arrive at the ruin you've been looking for. You look around and see that it's not much different than when you last saw it. The only thing different is that now there are several undead creatures roaming about. You walk up to one of them and cast a fireball at its head.

&gt; Read my spellbook

You turn to the book and begin reading. The first page has a picture of a man with a beard and mustache holding a wand. It reads: ""A wand is a tool used to manipulate energy. A wizard uses his magic to control the forces of nature.""

&gt; Turn the page and read it

You turn the page and read what appears to be an old tome full of spells. ""I am a wizard! I use my magic to control the forces of nature!"" You shout as you fire a bolt of lightning at another undead creature. You continue to read.

&gt; Turn to the next page and read the next page.
You turn to the next page and read what appears to be an ancient tome full of spells. ""I am a wizard! I use my magic to control the forces of nature!"" You shout as you fire a bolt of flame at another undead creature. You continue to read.

&gt; I cast an Ice Nova spell, freezing all the undead around me, then I cast an earthquake spell, shattering all their icy corpses.

You raise your hands and release a blast of cold air from your fingers. This freezes everything within a few feet of you. You then unleash a powerful shockwave that shatters the undead creatures' bodies. You then move on to the next page.

&gt; I put the book away and think to myself ""Wow that book is really something."" I walk into town to tell the townsfolk of my journey.

You walk into town and find yourself surrounded by many people. Some of them are curious while others seem frightened. ""What happened?"" One of the villagers asks. ""It was a long trip and we were hoping to get back before nightfall,"" You reply.

&gt; ""I was surrounded by undead creatures, but with the power of reading I was able to cast a few spells from my spellbook to get myself out of that bad situation. That's why you should always read kids.""

You smile and say ""I was surrounded by undead creatures, but with the power of reading I was able to cast a few spells from my spellbook to get myself out of that bad situation. That's why you should always read kids.""

&gt; I walk to the tavern to have a drink

You walk to the tavern and ask the bartender if he knows anything about the book. He tells you that it's called ""The Book of Spells"", but he doesn't know where it can be found.

&gt; ""That's very interesting, thanks I guess."" I drink the rest of my grog and I pay my bill. I walk out of the tavern and look around the city streets.

You walk down the street and notice how everyone seems to be walking slower than they did yesterday. You wonder if this is some sort of sign...

&gt; I use my mind's eye to peer into the future to see what it holds.

You use your mind's eye to peer into the future. You see a young girl in her early teens sitting in a tree house. She looks up when she hears a knock on the door. When she opens it, she sees a boy standing there.

&gt; ""I think I may have accidentally looked into the past, my own past."" I walked the local wizard library to find another book to borrow

You walk to the local wizard library and ask for help finding another book to borrow. The librarian gives you directions to the right place.

&gt; I take the book about summoning demonic creatures to do my bidding called: 'A Warlock's Handbook for Demons and stuff'

You take the book called ""A Warlock's Handbook for Demons and Stuff"". It has a lot of information about demons and their powers. You open it up and begin to read.

&gt; I closed the book and put it in my bag. I go outside and take the book back out of my bag and try to summon an imp using a spell from the ""Warlocks Handbook for Demons and Stuff""

You close the book and put it back in your bag. You then start to chant a spell and attempt to summon an imp. Unfortunately, the imp does not appear. You continue chanting and eventually the imp appears. You give him a few commands and he goes off to do his job.

&gt; ""Awesome! Reading is fun!"" I go back to the wizard library to find another book.

You return to the wizard library and ask for help finding another book to borrow. The librarian gives you directions to the right place.

&gt; I take the book called 'Necromancy and How to do It'

You take the book called ""Necromancy and How to do It"". It has a lot of information about necromancers and their abilities. You open it up and begin to read.

&gt; I go to the local graveyard and read a spell out of the book to try and resurrect a skeleton from the dead.

You head to the local graveyard and read a spell out of the book to try and raise a skeleton from the dead. Unfortunately, the spell fails and the skeleton remains as it was before death took it.

&gt; I try again to raise the skeleton from the dead using the spell from my book.

You try again to raise the skeleton from the dead using the spell from my book. This time however, you succeed. The skeleton is now much stronger and more resistant to pain. You feel very proud of yourself.

&gt; I raised the entire graveyard from the dead and command the legion of undead to attack the city.

You raise the entire graveyard from the dead and command the legion of undead to attack the city. They are very successful and kill many people. You also learn that the city is now under your control.

&gt; I raise all the people back from the dead that I killed, and command them to march toward the neighboring city.

You raise all the people back from the dead that I killed, and command them to march toward the neighboring city. They march with great enthusiasm towards the city. You feel like a hero.

&gt; I open a portal to hell and summon a demonic army. I command my demonic army to attack the neighboring Kingdom.

You open a portal to hell and summon a demonic army. You send them against the neighboring kingdom. They easily wipe out most of the population there. You feel very happy.

&gt; I make it rain green fire, burning the city with cursed flames.

You make it rain green fire, burning the city with cursed flames. You feel even happier than when you were raising the skeletons from the dead.

&gt; I frolic through my burning city and sing songs about how I love to read and raise armies from the dead.

You are Brain, a genetically mutated super intelligent mouse. You are megalomaniac. You want to take over the world. Every night you set up on an adventure to try to conquer the world with some crazy invention. Your buddy Pinky, a dimwitted genetically mutated mouse with a heart of gold always try to help you. But you always fail comically. Tonight, in your cage in the Acme lab, you think hard about your next plan and what you should do next. You: ""I need to get out of here."" Pinky: ""What? I thought we were supposed to be working together!

**&gt;** **Start to pick the lock of the cage and ask Pinky : ""are you thinking what I'm thinking ?""**

Pinky: ""No, but I know you are."" You: ""Well then why don't you come with me?"" Pinky: ""But I can't leave my cage!

**&gt;** **""why can't you leave your cage ?""**

You: ""Because I have to stay here!"" Pinky: ""Why not?"" You: ""Because if I left, you would probably eat me!"" Pinky: ""So you're saying that you'd let me go free because I'm cute?""

**&gt;** **Sigh. ""Yes, of course""**

You: ""Fine, but I'll make sure you get eaten by the mice first!"" Pinky: ""Okay, fine, I'll go with you."" You: ""Goodbye, Pinky."" And so it begins...

**&gt;** **Build a giant electro magnet**

The Electro Magnet is a device which allows you to control any object with electricity. It's been around for centuries, but only recently has anyone managed to put it into use. The problem is, it requires a lot of power to work properly.

**&gt;** **""Pinky ! We need to go the nuclear generator to divert electricity so we can power the electro magnet""**

Pinky: ""But how will we divert electricity ? I mean it takes a lot of power to run the generator!""

**&gt;** **""we'll run a power chord extension between them""**

Pinky: ""But we don't have enough power to extend a power chord from the generator to the electro magnet !!""

**&gt;** **""Let's build a giant dynamo powered by hamster wheel then""**

&amp;#x200B;

 

You are Ozymandias, a noble living in the kingdom of Larion. You have a pouch of gold and a small dagger. You are awakened by one of your servants who tells you that your keep is under attack. You look out the window and see a large army marching towards your door. ""Run!"" you shout to your servant. ""We must hide in the vaults! We can't fight them all!"" The next few hours are frantic as you try to find a way out of this situation.

**&gt;** **""Servants ! Deal with this situation !""**

Your servants run off into the city and quickly come back with some sort of device that they call a 'portal'. They then open it up and go through it. You are now trapped inside the city of Larion. There is no escape for you.

**&gt;** **Go through the portal**

You enter the portal and immediately feel yourself being transported to another place. This new place has a very different appearance from the world you know. It's like when you first stepped onto the moon. The sky is blue and there is an orange glow around everything. Everything looks so... magical.

**&gt;** **Look around for my servants**

You search everywhere for your servants. You don't even notice that you've been gone too long. Suddenly, you hear a voice calling out to you. ""Hello, traveler."" It's the voice of a man dressed in black robes.

**&gt;** **""Hark ! A vagrant !""**

You turn around and see a man wearing black robes standing before you. He stands at about 6' tall and his body is covered in tattoos. His face is covered in scars and he has a scar on his forehead. He wears a hooded cloak over his head and carries a staff with him.

**&gt;** **Try not to look too disgusted**

He smiles at you and says ""Welcome to my home. I am known as the Necromancer. My name means death and I'm here to help you.""

**&gt;** **""great news ! Can you tell me where I can find your liege ? I cannot stay too long with vagrants like you. It would simply not do""**

He nods and points to a nearby building. ""This is where I live. In fact, this entire city is mine. I own it and I will protect it at any cost.""

**&gt;** **""you certainly do not look like a nobleman""**

**&gt;** **""Now, be a respectable host and bring me some fine wine""**

You nod and follow him outside. As soon as you get outside, you see a group of men in black cloaks standing in front of a large mansion. You also see several guards walking around the mansion.

**&gt;** **""why must it always be peasants ? I can't stand peasants""**

The Necromancer frowns and shakes his head.

**&gt;** **""have you seen my servants by the way ?""**

The Necromancer sighs and shrugs. ""No, but I trust you'll manage to find them. Good luck.""

**&gt;** **""you don't really expect me to work, do you ?""**

The Necromancer laughs and says ""Of course not! I just wanted to make sure you'd have no problems finding your way into my home.

You are in the oval office rage tweeting about your impeachment.  Your aides try to wrest your phone from your hands but you grab it back with a vengeance.

""I'm not going to take this anymore!"" you shout. ""This is a coup! The Deep State has been trying to kill me for six months by any means necessary! They're going to pay for every fucking inch they've taken!""

&gt; Write out a tweet saying ""NO COLLUSION!  WITCH HUNT!"" as you make a big boy poop in your diaper

""No collusion,"" you say. ""A witch hunt."" Then you write: ""Witch Hunt!"" on Twitter.

&gt; Buzz Stephen Miller in to change your diaper

You send a message to Stephen Miller, who is now your senior adviser at the White House. ""Stephen, I want my diapers changed. I don't care if it's in the middle of the night. It's time to grow up.""

Miller responds: ""Sure thing sir.""

&gt; Yell ""WHERE IS MY DIET COKE.  I ASKED FOR A DIET COKE!"" at Stephen Miller

You send a tweet to Stephen Miller asking where the Diet Coke is. Miller doesn't respond right away. He just says he'll get it soon.

Then you hear a loud noise outside the Oval Office. You open the door and see that it was just Stephen Miller banging on the door.

&gt; He gives you your diet coke and asks you to calm down

You give him your Diet Coke and tell him to be quiet. Miller tells you that he wants to talk to you.

&gt; Ask Steven Miller to read you a racist bedtime story

You call Steve Miller over to the couch and ask him to read you a racist bedtime story. Miller reads you a scary tale about a little black baby being kidnapped by a bunch of white people.

""That sounds like something my grandmother would have told me when I was a kid,""

&gt; Suck your thumb and fall asleep

You go into deep sleep and wake up to find yourself in a diaper.

&gt; Look at your presidential schedule for today

You look at your Presidential Schedule and see that you will be meeting with Stephen Miller to discuss the Muslim ban.

&gt; Meet with Stephen Miller

&gt; Ask Stephen Miller why we can't just line up all the Muslims and shoot them

Miller looks at you and then at his phone. ""Mr. President, what are you doing?""

&gt; Order the military to shoot all the muslims

Miller turns around and stares at you. ""Mr. President, I'm sorry but this executive order is not only constitutional, but necessary to protect our country from radical Islamic terrorism.""

&gt; Tell Stephen Miller to suck your dick and ready the nuclear weapons

Miller stands up and walks out of the room. You sit back down at your desk and wait for the missile launch.

&gt; Give the command to nuke Iraq

The missiles fly through the air and hit their targets. The whole world watches as the entire Middle East burns.

You watch as the smoke clears and you see nothing but ashes.

The end...

2019-12-20-191857,,AI Dungeon 2 Unleashed got updated to version 2.0,"I have updated AI Dungeon 2 Unleashed to version 2.0 (Where the first number indicates the amount of times it is rebased on upstream code, and the second number shows the amount of revisions on the current base). For those who have missed it Unleashed is a modified version of AI Dungeon 2 based on the Thadunge2 fork that is specifically made for easy installation and local play on Windows. But, since 2.0 is now also playable on Linux if you install the dependencies manually.

**What is new?**

* Updated to the latest AI Dungeon 2 bringing /alter, /encrypt, random story generation, better context editing and the latest AI Dungeon improvements.
* Updated my own changes to streamline the opening menu, custom games are now in the same menu as the random games and the usual pick a character prompt (which itself no longer contains a 4) Custom option).
* Remade the old /restart from Unleashed 1.0 as /menu, unleashed brings a new /restart that restarts the current story.
* Improved support for Linux (and probably OSX) players with the screen refresh now automatically detecting the OS and issuing the appropriate command rather than it always executing it for a Windows machine.
* Smaller changes to the surrounding files so it is more clear especially for users of another operating system, and i have included a cleanup script in case you wish to redistribute it without your cache and save files present.
* /print no longer prints the screen (Not needed in Unleashed since it does this after every action) but still prints it to transcript.txt like the original Unleashed.

**Where can i grab it or see a list of the full features?**  
You can grab the downloads from my website [https://henk.tech/aid](https://henk.tech/aid) you will also be able to see the system requirements and a full description.

2019-12-20-203901,,An existencial adventure,"**Created By:** Ravnclaw**Date:** Fri Dec 20 2019  


You are Gumbo, a survivor trying to survive in a post apocalyptic world by scavenging among the ruins of what is left. You have a hatchet and a hunting rifle. You live in a small community of survivors who have managed to build a piece of civilization after the bombs fell. You are talking to one of the leaders of the community when you hear screams coming from outside.  ""Run!"" you shout as loud as you can. ""The infected are out there! Run for your lives!"" The leader looks at you with surprise. ""What? I thought we were safe here.""  ""We're not safe,""

**&gt; ""Well we are ok""**

""We are ok,"" he says, ""but we need more help.""  ""How?""  He shrugs his shoulders. ""I don't know... We could go back to town...

**&gt; Go back to town an search for bombs**

You decide that it would be best if you went back to town and look around for any bombs. You walk up to the door and knock on it. A woman opens the door and lets you in. She tells you she doesn't know anything about bombs or zombies.

**&gt; ""Where had you been all this time?""**

She replies, ""Oh, I was just going to get some food and water from my house. I'm sorry, but I really didn't know where else to go.""  You tell her that you will head back to town and ask her name. She tells you her name is Mrs.

**&gt; Rembo**

You thank her and tell her you'll be back soon. She thanks you again and then closes the door. You head back to town and find a large store called ""Food City"". It's mostly filled with shelves full of canned goods and other food stuffs.

**&gt; Defy god**

You decide to ignore God and continue to eat whatever you want. You spend hours eating everything in sight. Eventually you feel like you've eaten enough and you stop. You lie down on the floor and close your eyes.

**&gt; Dream of god**

You wake up feeling very tired. You sit up and notice that you are no longer hungry. You also notice that you are no longer thirsty either. You are confused by this turn of events so you try to remember what happened during your sleep.

**&gt; Remember**

You open your eyes and see yourself lying on the ground. There is a man standing over you holding a knife to your throat. He looks at you and smiles. ""Good morning, son.""

**&gt; ""You are not my father, actually i am""**

The man frowns. ""No, you aren't. But you do resemble him somewhat.""

**&gt; ""That is not true you liar""**

The man sighs. ""Well, yes, but...""

**&gt; ""But?""**

The man shrugs. ""I don't know. Maybe he was a good person once. Maybe he wasn't. Who knows? Anyway, we have nothing more to talk about.""

**&gt; ""Oh indeed we have, what do you think about the political status of Israel?""**

The man thinks for a moment. ""Hmm... well, it depends on who you speak to. The people here seem pretty happy with their current situation.""

**&gt; ""Continue""**

The man nods. ""Yes, I suppose they are. They would probably be even happier if the world didn't care as much about them anymore. In any case, I'm sure you will get used to your new life soon.""

**&gt; ""And what about jews, we all love jews here""**

The man sighs. ""Jews are an interesting lot. They are loyal citizens, but they are also very religious. That can sometimes cause problems when dealing with others. Still, most of them are nice people.""

**&gt; ""You see like a pretty good person, why do you do this to me?This is illegal dude""**

The man shakes his head. ""It's not illegal. It's just not something that many people want to do. Besides, it isn't really hurting anyone. And besides, it's not like you're going to die from it anyway.""

**&gt; ""Are you sure about that?Tell me your name""**

The man pauses. ""My name is John. What is yours?""

**&gt; ""My name is Gumbo, nice to meet you""**

Gumbo smiles and says ""Nice to meet you too."" He then walks away.

**&gt; Become friends with Jhon**

You walk into the next room. A large poster of a smiling woman greets you. She has long blonde hair and wears glasses. Her eyes are closed and she holds a bouquet of flowers in her hands. She looks so peaceful.  A voice suddenly calls out.

**&gt; It is John**

You turn around and see a tall man wearing a white lab coat. He stares at you with a blank expression. ""What the hell are you doing here?""

**&gt; ""Heroin dude, heroin""**

John frowns. ""I don't think that's my real name.""

**&gt; ""You are John indeed, my good friend""**

He chuckles. ""Well, that's certainly a first. Well, let's get to know each other better shall we?""

**&gt; ""Yeah, what do you think about the situation of Hong Kong?""**

He shrugs. ""Hong Kong is a wonderful place. I'd love to stay there for as long as possible.""

**&gt; ""And?...""**

He sighs.

**&gt; ""I get it you are not really John""**

He laughs.

**&gt; ""Where is John?!""**

He points to his head. ""That's right, he died in a car crash yesterday.""

**&gt; ""But how?!""**

He shakes his head. ""It was an accident. We were driving too fast and he lost control of the vehicle. It hit a tree and burst into flames. The police are investigating the case but I'm sure they'll find nothing wrong. There was no one else on board.""

**&gt; ""Except you""**

He nods. ""Yes, I am John. But I am also your friend, so I want to ask you something. What would be the best thing if happened to me?""

**&gt; ""To finally find a girlfriend""**

He smiles. ""Hmmm... That sounds like a great idea! Let's go talk to her!""

**&gt; ""Yeah of course""Do not believe him**

You nod. ""Okay then, let's go talk to her.""

**&gt; What if John actually killed the real John, that is possible but what if there was not a guy named John all along, what if I need to forget the accident, it was not my fault afterall.**

He frowns.

**&gt; ""You know what I am thinking are you?""**

He shrugs. ""Well, I don't think so, but I will tell you anyway. If we can somehow make this girl forget about the accident, then she will love us forever. And that is our goal.""

**&gt; ""What are you talking about John, wake up, none of this is real""**

He sighs. ""I know, but that's why we have to do it. She will never forget about the accident. Even if we meet again, she won't remember anything about me.""

**&gt; ""This shit is deep, you know that the accident never really happened do you?**

He shrugs. ""No, I guess not. But I still feel sad about it. So I thought I should try to make things better for myself by making a new life for myself. I mean who knows maybe she remembers everything about me.""

**&gt; ""Go on then dude, go on""**

He looks at you with sadness in his eyes. ""But I don't want to die. I want to live forever.""

**&gt; ""John you have to accept it, the accident was not your fault, go with her, I will always remember you""**

He shakes his head. ""It's too late now. I can't change anything. It's over. I'm sorry.""

**&gt; ""Yes you can, follow the light John you can do it, go with her""**

He nods. ""Alright then, I'll be waiting for you."" He turns around and walks away from the door. You turn back to the woman. ""So how did you get here?""

**&gt; ""Who the fuck are you?""**

She smiles. ""My name is Mary, I just moved here a few days ago.""

**&gt; She is actually death and she has came for me**

You shake your head.

**&gt; Yes she is**

Mary smiles. ""Oh I am very happy to see you. I didn't expect to see you again after all these years.""

**&gt; ""Who really are you?""**

Mary smiles. ""I am Death, or rather the personification of Death. I've been watching you ever since you were born. I knew you would grow up to become someone important.""

**&gt; ""Im not as important as you may think, I am just another person in the world""**

Mary laughs. ""Well that's certainly an interesting way of looking at things. Anyway, I suppose we should get to know each other better. What brings you out here anyway? You could have just stayed home like most people do.""

**&gt; ""I search for God, i want to meet him and ask him some questions of great importance to me""**

Mary smiles. ""Ah yes, I remember when you were little. You used to pray to me for answers on everything. You even said you wanted to be like me.""

**&gt; ""You are god too?!""**

Mary laughs.

**&gt; ""Well let me ask some questions then""**

Mary looks at you with a smile. ""Very well, what shall it be?""

**&gt; ""By who were you created?""**

Mary stares at you. ""What?! How did you know that?""

**&gt; ""Because i know the truth""**

Mary sighs. ""How can you possibly know such a thing? I mean how could you possibly know that?""

**&gt; ""I know many things that you do not know, you are not as wise as you may think, and I know why""**

Mary frowns. ""You...you don't believe me?""

**&gt; ""No, i have changed over the course of the years and know I know the truth""**

Mary nods. ""Good, because if you're lying about this, then you'll be telling lies about yourself too.""

**&gt; ""You want me to tell you about who actually created you?""**

Mary raises her eyebrows. ""Who?""

**&gt; ""Me,the people, the humanity, over the course of our history we needed to believe in something to  calm the thought of loneliness,death and disparity, you are not real, I created you""**

Mary's eyes widen. ""You really believe that?""

**&gt; Become Nietszche**

Mary smiles. ""Yes, I am so happy you've come around to my way of thinking. Thank you for being honest with me."" She hugs you tightly. ""Now, let us get back to work.""  You kiss Mary goodbye and head back to your office.

**&gt; ""Oh wow now im friends with god"" Dance over desk**

As you dance on the desk, you feel an odd sensation in your mind. It feels like you're going through some sort of trance. You also notice that when you move your hands, they seem to go from one place to another. This is followed by a strange feeling of euphoria.

**&gt; ""God has drugged me?!""**

You look up and see Mary staring at you. ""What?""

**&gt; ""What have you done?!""**

She looks down and shakes her head. ""Nothing, I just felt something.""

**&gt; ""Be real for once God""**

She laughs. ""I'm sorry, but I can't do that. I'm not a drug addict or anything like that.""

**&gt; ""You are telling me that i am a drug addict?!How could you?!I created you?!""**

She looks away. ""I don't know what you mean. I guess it would explain why I haven't been able to talk to you as much lately.""

**&gt; ""I hate you...""Fade into darkness**

The next day you wake up and realize that you forgot to take your medication. You immediately think about how you need to get rid of this problem before you forget all about it again. You decide to call Mary and tell her that you need to speak with her right away.

**&gt; ""God i am coming for you""**

You quickly rush out of your room and find Mary waiting outside. ""Hey Mary, where are you? I was supposed to talk to you today!""

**&gt; Improvise conversation with God**

""So...you came here then?""

**&gt; Continue**

""Yeah, I was supposed to meet you in the library.""

**&gt; ""Why?""**

""Because I wanted to ask you something.""

**&gt; ""What do you wanted to ask me?""**

""Well, I've always wondered if you were really there. I mean I have tried asking other people, but they always said no. But I thought maybe you might be lying to everyone else about being there, so I decided to see if you'd answer my question.""

**&gt; ""Ask me your question then""**

""Okay, what is it?""

**&gt; Continue**

""Do you even care at all about anything?""

**&gt; ""I care about the people I love""**

""But why would you want to lie to them?""

**&gt; "" I did not lied to you, i told you the truth and you know it""**

""Oh...""

**&gt; ""Come here""Hug Mary**

""That's a good boy!""

**&gt; ""You fucker""**

""Shut up! I'm serious!""

**&gt; ""I knew this was a trap, you wanted me to serve you, but i came prepared"" Take out Big Fucking Gun**

""No, don't shoot, just hug me for a bit longer!""

**&gt; ""We all have to come to this realization God, for you are dead""  Shoot God**

""What the hell? What the fuck!?""

**&gt; Shoot repeatdly God with Big Fucking Gun**

""WHAT THE FUCK!? WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING TO ME!?""

**&gt; ""I am doing what is right""**

""YOU'RE NOT RIGHTING ANYTHING!""

**&gt; Continue shooting**

""SHOOT HIM IN THE HEAD.""

**&gt; ""You can not control me God , for we have killed you"" Kill God**

**&gt; The End**

The end of your life is finally at hand.

You wake up at the break of dawn and get to working in the fields. In the distance, your master is yelling at some other workers. You recollect that you were supposed to be doing something else, but then he yells at you for not being careful enough with your work

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You be careful with your work.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You look around and see that there is no one watching you. You can't afford to make any mistakes. You quickly finish your task and leave the field. You walk down the road towards the city of Isett

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You make sure that you are wearing pants.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You walk along the street and you notice that there are people walking about their business. It's time to go back home!

As you reach the edge of town, you hear the voice of your master calling out to you

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You ask your master ""what the fuck?"".

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

""What the \*\*\*\*?"" you say in confusion.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You ask the master guy what is it that he wants.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The man looks at you and says ""I want you to go to the city of Isett and tell them that I am dead"".

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You tell him that you will need proof of his death.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

He smiles and says ""Well then you should take some of my belongings"". He hands you a bag filled with coins and other valuables.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You tell him ""all right"" and then go to Isett.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You enter the city and as soon as you get inside you find yourself in a large hall. A crowd has gathered around a large table where a man is sitting. The crowd is silent as they wait for you to speak.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You tell them that your master is dead and present to them your master's valuables.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

They all stare at you as if expecting you to do something stupid like steal the valuables or even kill them. They don't know why you would lie to them. Your master is dead after all.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You go to the local elementary school.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You walk into the nearest elementary school and sit down on a bench. The teacher walks up to you and asks ""Are you new here?""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You pull out your walkman and start playing Pumped Up Kicks by Foster the People.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

She stares at you as she listens to the music. She doesn't seem surprised by your actions. You continue to play and she continues to stare at you. Finally she speaks 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You listen to what she says.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

""So you're not a student here then? You must be one of those kids who come to school every day but never actually learn anything"".

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You ask her when Spaceship Day is.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

She nods and tells you ""It's tomorrow"".

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You go ask Hagrid the Table for advice.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You walk over to the table and ask ""How old is this place?""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You listen to his answer.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

""This place was built in the year 1920, so about ten years ago"".

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You attempt to warn Hagrid about Adolf Hitler.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Hagrid looks at you and laughs ""Oh yes, I remember you. You were always asking me questions about the future. Now I'm going to tell you everything you wanted to know"".

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You listen to everything you wanted to know.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Hagrid begins to explain how Hitler came to power and how he planned to destroy the world. He also explains that the only way to stop him was to build a spaceship big enough to carry everyone off planet earth

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You ask him if Adolf Hitler is dead.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Hagrid looks at you and shakes his head ""No, he isn't dead yet. But he won't be anytime soon. He needs to die now"".

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You have an epic battle with Adolf Hitler.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You begin to fight with Adolf Hitler. You punch him, kick him, bite him, stab him, beat him and more. Eventually you manage to knock him out and put him in your backpack. When you return to the village, you hand over your backpack and tell them that you are leaving

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You ride off into the sunset.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You ride off into the sunset. You arrive home and you tell your mother that you are going to live on the farm until you grow up. She is very happy for you and hugs you. She tells you that you are going to be famous",,,,[],False,False,UnholyReaver,1357580459,,,[],,,,text,t2_a4x9s,False,False,[],True,False,,,False,1576900820,,,self.AIDungeon,False,0,False,edkxv3,True,False,False,False,True,True,False,,adventure,[],Adventure,dark,text,False,,False,True,0,0,False,,/r/AIDungeon/comments/edkxv3/gimellos_day_at_school/,False,,False,,,,1586859240,3,,True,False,False,AIDungeon,t5_29uaei,r/AIDungeon,15372,public,,self,,,0,[],https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/edkxv3/gimellos_day_at_school/,,

2019-12-21-105541,,It turns out I am a bad king.,"You are the king of the kingdom of Zorba, a magic kingdom far across the sea.
  Your family has ruled for generations from within Castle Perilous.  Today,
 you are holding court in your throne room when the doors open and an old man
 steps through

&gt; have the guards execute the old man

""No, no, no! No! This isn't right! I don't want to die! Please, just let me go
 back!"".

""Why should I trust you? You're not even a real wizard! You're just pretending
 to be one"".

&gt; stab the old man in the throat

You stab the old man in the neck. Blood spurts out. He falls backwards onto the
 ground. His eyes are wide open. You feel your heart stop for a moment

&gt; bury the old man's corpse in the garden

You bury the old man's body in the garden. You then leave the palace.

&gt; find the high priest and tell him what happened

You walk through the palace halls. You find the high priest. He's sitting in
 a chair, looking at a book. You stand up and approach him.

&gt; tell the high priest about the old man

""I've been searching for you all day"".

""Oh yes, I'm sure you have"", he says. 

&gt; ask the high priest what he means by that

""He's dead"".

&gt; ask the high priest who the old man was

""He was the last wizard that taught me anything useful"".

&gt; have the high priest thrown in the dungeon

""No! That's not how it works!"", you shout.

&gt; guards, arrest the high priest

You order the guards to arrest the high priest. They obey.

&gt; schedule the high priest's execution for the next day

You make sure the execution goes ahead the next day. It takes place without incident.

&gt; appoint a new high priest

You appoint a new high priest. He is a little older than the previous one. He
 still manages to teach himself magic though. He teaches others magic too.

&gt; ask my chief spymaster what he thinks of the new high priest

""He's a good man, but he lacks discipline"".

&gt; raise taxes dramatically

You increase taxes significantly. The people seem happy about it.

&gt; raise taxes even higher than before, to punishingly high levels

You raise taxes so much that they cause an economic collapse. People become desperate
 and start stealing from each other.

&gt; make a law punishing stealing with immediate execution

You make a law punishing theft with death immediately.

&gt; wait for everything to get better

Things get worse. People steal from each other more. You try to stop it, but
 it's too late. A few years pass and nothing is left except ruins.

&gt; mourn my fallen kingdom

The old man dies. Your kingdom crumbles into ruin. You weep bitterly. Years later,
 when you're walking down the street, you hear a voice call out to you.
&gt; listen to what the voice has to say

""Hello there"".

""Who are you?"".

""My name is Ardan. What brings you here?"".

""It's about the old man"".

""Ah yes, the old wizard. You remember him, don't you?""

&gt; tell Ardan I killed the old man

""Yes, I did. But why?"".

You are Lem , a noble living
in the kingdom of Larion. You
have a pouch of gold and a
small dagger. You are awakened
by one of your servants who
tells you that your keep is
under attack. You look out the
window and see a horde of orcs
charging towards your
keep.    


""Run!"" you shout, ""I will hold
them off.""

another rushes back to tell
you that the enemy has already
reached your keep.

and cookies     

The orc comes running up to
you with a smile on his face.
He looks like he could be any
Orc, but he is much bigger
than most. He is huge! The
first thing you notice about
him is his teeth. They are
massive and sharp looking.

tea   


He grins at you and nods. He
then takes a seat next to you.
He reaches over and grabs a
cookie from your hand.

""For what?"" you ask.

2019-12-21-215748,,"This is a pretty standard Batman story, yeah.","You are vengeance.  You are the night.  You are Batman.  Patrolling Gotham City
 in your Batmobile, you strike fear into the hearts of criminals.  Today, you
 are zooming down the street towards a reported crime when you see something
 out of the ordinary

&gt; investigate what I saw

You don't know what it is, but whatever it is, it's bad and you need to stop
 it before it gets worse

&gt; go stop that bad thing from getting worse

You speed up as fast as you can, but even with all your might, you can't keep
 up with this thing.  It's faster than anything you've ever encountered, and
 you're not sure if you'll be able to catch it

&gt; throw a batarang at the fast thing

You jump into the air and swing your arm forward, catching the batarang in mid-air.
 The creature howls in pain, but doesn't move away or try to escape. It seems
 to be waiting for you to make another move.

&gt; tell the creature that I am batman

The creature lets out a horrible shriek and charges towards you. You swing your
 batarang and hit the creature right between its eyes. The creature falls backwards
 on the ground, dead.

&gt; examine the creature's corpse to figure out where it came from

You pick up the body of the creature and look at it closely. You find out that
 it was an orc, but he had been killed by some other orcs. He didn't have any
 weapons on him either, so it seemed like they were just trying to kill him for
 no reason

&gt; track down the other orcs in Gotham

You head back home and report everything to your parents. They aren't happy about
 what happened, but they understand. You explain that you will now have to take
 extra precautions when dealing with these creatures.

&gt; unmask whoever is pretending to be Batman's parents; they cannot be real because MY PARENTS ARE DEAD

You decide to unmask the people who are pretending to be Batman's parents. Your
 mother is shocked, while your father is angry. They say that you should just
 leave them alone, since they are too old to worry about such things anymore

&gt; tie up the fake mother and father and take them to the police

You decide to take the two people to the police station. You explain that you
 want to speak to someone who can help you, since you think there is something
 very wrong with the city.

&gt; remind the receptionist at the police station that I am Batman

You walk into the police station and see that the receptionist is staring at
 you. She looks surprised and asks if you are Batman. You nod, and she tells
 you that she has heard of you, but never met you. You ask her if she knows Bruce
 Wayne, and she says yes

&gt; tell her Bruce Wayne is very handsome and very cool but has nothing to do with me, Batman

You tell her that Bruce Wayne is very handsome and very cool, but has nothing
 to do with you, Batman. She smiles and thanks you, then leaves.

&gt; deliver my fake parents to Police Chief Gordon

You enter the police station and wait patiently until the receptionist comes
 back. She greets you warmly, but you tell her that you want to talk to someone
 who can help you. She looks surprised again, and asks if you are Batman

&gt; tell her that yes, we have gone over this.  I am Batman and have no idea who this Bruce Wayne person is.

She nods and tells you that you are Batman and that you have no idea who this
 Bruce Wayne person is. She goes on to say that you could probably get him to
 come to Arkham Asylum to give his testimony.

&gt; have Alfred disguise himself as Bruce Wayne and come to Arkham in my place

You tell Alfred to disguise himself as Bruce Wayne and come to Arkham in your
 place. Alfred agrees and heads off. You feel slightly better knowing that the
 Joker is finally taken care of.

&gt; leave my fake parents in Arkham and go outside to fight crime in Gotham as Batman

You leave your fake parents in Arkham and head out to deal with crime in Gotham
 as Batman. You find yourself fighting criminals and thugs, but you still don't
 know why you are doing this. Perhaps it's because you miss being a hero?

&gt; tell myself that I am a hero.  I am vengeance.  I am the night.  I am BATMAN.

You tell yourself that you are a hero. You are vengeance. You are the night.
 You are BATMAN. Then you remember that you are Batman. You rush through the
 crowd and knock out several criminals with ease. You are unstoppable!

&gt; tell the criminals that I am Batman

You tell the criminals that you are Batman. They are confused, but realize that
 you must be telling the truth. You continue to fight criminals and thugs, but
 you still don't know why you are doing this. Perhaps it's because you miss being
 a hero

&gt; retire as Batman and become Bruce Wayne

You retire as Batman and become Bruce Wayne. You begin to live a normal life
 as usual. One day, you receive a letter from your parents. They thank you for
 saving their lives once more. You open the letter and read it

2019-12-21-222207,,"Literally a better Star Wars story than the last few films, even with the plot twist at the end","You are Luke Skywalker, farmboy-turned-Jedi and hero of the rebellion.  Your
 lightsaber hangs at your belt, and you are accompanied by your trusty droids
 R2D2 and C3PO.  You have landed on a strange planet with Han Solo and Princess
 Leia to investigate reports of Imperial activity.  As you step off of the Millennium
 Falcon and onto the planet’s surface, you pull out your binoculars and scan
 the horizon, only to see something that makes you stop in your tracks

&gt; tell Han and Leia what I saw

You turn to look at the two stormtroopers standing nearby and say ""There is an
 Imperial Star Destroyer heading this way"".  The troopers do not move or acknowledge
 your statement, but they do not need to; you know without looking that their
 minds are focused on other things

&gt; attack the stormtroopers with my lightsaber

With a cry, you swing your lightsaber as hard as you can at one of the soldiers.
  He blocks it with his heavy armor, but you feel the impact and the heat from
 the blade.  His helmet deflects most of the force of the blow, but it still
 hurts like hell

&gt; examine my lightsaber, which is apparently much less deadly than I remember it being in the past

Your lightsaber has been repaired by the Empire.  It was once a powerful weapon,
 but its energy cells were depleted after the destruction of the first Death
 Star.  Now, it functions just fine.  Its blade is also much sharper than before

&gt; stab the stormtroopers with my repaired lightsaber

The soldier's armor stops your sword, but he is strong enough to grab hold of
 your hand and pull you into him.  With a yell of pain, you fall backwards onto
 the ground.  As you lie there, you hear the trooper shout 

&gt; listen to the trooper

""We have received reports of a Rebel base on Yavin 4"".  He continues.  ""It will
 be attacked soon.  We need all the men we can get here.  There may even be survivors"".

A few moments pass...

&gt; ask the stormtrooper how he knows about the Rebel base on Yavin 4

He looks up at you, and says ""I am a Storm Trooper, sir.  I serve under Captain
 Veers, sir"".

&gt; use a Jedi mind trick to make the Storm Troopers think I am Captain Veers, then tell them to leave

You raise your hands and call upon the Force to make the stormtroopers believe
 you are Captain Veers.  They quickly return to their posts.  You then speak
 to them directly. 

&gt; ask them when the attack on Yavin 4 will occur

They reply ""As soon as possible, sir"", and begin walking away.  You smile and
 wave goodbye, then continue your walk through the forest

&gt; quickly return to the Millennium Falcon and set a course for Yavin 4 so we can warn them

You quickly return to the ship and set a course for Yavin 4.  Soon, you are out
 of range of the stormtroopers and flying towards the planet. 

&gt; land on Yavin 4 and ask to speak to Mon Mothma

You land on the surface of Yavin 4 and approach the large stone monolith.  A
 voice calls out to you from within the monolith.  You recognize it immediately
 as the voice of Princess Leah, who had died during the Battle of Endor

&gt; ask Princess Leia if she knows Princess Leah

She replies 

&gt; listen to her reply

""Yes, I do.  She is my friend, and I miss her terribly"".

&gt; swear to avenge princess Leah

You stand silently for a moment, listening to her words.  Then, you respond.

&gt; tell princess Leia that the Empire is going to attack Yavin 4

Princess Leah smiles and nods.  She tells you that she will contact you again
 shortly. 

You fly the Millennium Falcon back to the Alliance headquarters.  When you arrive,
 you find that the Alliance has already prepared for war

&gt; offer my assistance to the rebels as a Jedi

You agree to help the Rebellion as a Jedi.  You promise to meet with them again
 soon. 

&gt; get in my X-Wing and take off

You jump into your X-wing and head towards the rebel base.  You hope that the
 Rebels will be able to send you reinforcements soon. 

You arrive at the rebel base and land safely.  The Rebels are ready for battle

&gt; fight alongside the rebels in the upcoming battle

You join the rebels in fighting against the Empire.  You learn that the Empire
 plans to launch a full scale assault on the Rebel base.  You see several ships
 flying near the Rebel base

&gt; shoot at the Imperial ships

You fire your laser rifle at the Imperial ships.  Unfortunately, your shots are
 ineffective.  You watch as the Imperial ships destroy the Rebel fighters and
 destroy the Rebel base. 

&gt; swear revenge for the rebels

You go over to the dead bodies of the Rebel pilots and stormtroopers.  You curse
 the Empire for killing innocent people.  You vow vengeance. 

&gt; locate the Empire's newest Death Star

You search the desert for the Death Star.  Eventually, you come across a small
 group of Imperial troops.  One of them recognizes you and asks you where you
 came from.  You explain that you are a Jedi Knight and a member of the rebellion

&gt; demand to know where the new Death Star is

You refuse to answer the question.  Instead, you point out that the Empire must
 be planning something big, because they killed everyone in sight.  You then
 point out that the Empire has destroyed the entire area around the Rebel base

&gt; forget it, just hunt down The Emperor and kill him

You ignore the Empire and focus on finding the Emperor.  You follow the trail
 of clues left behind you and eventually find the Emperor's palace.  You enter
 the palace and find yourself face to face with the Emperor.  He is wearing an
 elaborate suit of power armor

&gt; attack the Emperor with my lightsaber

You attempt to cut the Emperor's arm off, but he easily blocks your blows.  He
 raises his own lightsaber and attacks you with it.  You block his blows and
 manage to knock the Emperor's lightsaber aside

&gt; cut off the emperor's head

You slash the Emperor's throat open and rip out his brain.  You look at the severed
 head on the floor and feel nothing.  You turn to the Emperor and say ""This is
 what you wanted, isn't it?""

&gt; turn to the dark side because I killed the emperor in accordance with his plan

You grab the Emperor's helmet and put it on.  You then turn to the Emperor and
 say ""I'm sorry, but this is what you wanted"".

&gt; rule the galaxy as Evil Luke Skywalker

You become Darth Vader.  You now have complete control over the Empire.  You
 lead it to victory after victory.  You even defeat the Emperor in combat once,
 only to lose him to the Dark Side again

&gt; rule the empire with an iron fist and crush my former rebel friends

You continue ruling the Empire as usual.  You start killing all the other leaders
 of the Rebel Alliance.  You also wipe out the last remnants of the Empire. 
 You finally eliminate the last remnants of the old Empire

&gt; declare the Empire of First Choice

You decide to make the Empire of First Choice.  You banish all those who oppose
 you to the depths of space.  You create a clone army of young children and train
 them to be soldiers.  You then unleash them upon the galaxy

&gt; conquer the galaxy

You begin conquering the galaxy.  You use the clone army to wipe out any opposition.
  You then use the clones to wipe out the last remnants of the Empire.  You finally
 eradicate the last remnants of the old Empire

&gt; declare victory

You declare victory and destroy the last remnants of the old Empire.  You then
 destroy the planet Yavin IV and the last remnants of the old Empire disappear
 forever

&gt; win

You finish reading the book and smile.  You don't need to read anymore books
 about the Force.  You can learn everything you want to learn about the Force

Later it devolved into a murder mystery where a killer clown both did and did not kill my brother, and the police officer thinks I’m crazy. So pretty spot on.

———————-

You are a secretary in the law
offices of Clark-Gable. You have
been working on a recent murder
case. You are searching for an
important document in various
file-cabinets when your coworker
Bob walks up. ""Hey, I found it,""
he says. ""It's in the office of
Mr. Gable.""

""I'll be right out,"" you
say.

Bob heads to his office and you
follow him.


&gt; Knock on Mr. Gable’s door.

The door opens and you see Mr.
Gable standing there with a
pistol in hand. He looks at you.
""What do you want?""

""Mr. Gable, I'm here about the
document.""

""Oh? What is it that you need?

&gt; “Nothing, I can come back later
if now is a bad time”

""No, no, no! This isn't good!
Come on!""

He leads you into his office
where there is a desk piled high
with papers. On top of this pile
sits a large filing cabinet. The
drawer itself has several files
open.

&gt; “I just need the police report
filed by Officer Trenton on the
night of discovery.”


""OK, but what about the victim?

&gt; “I already have the autopsy of
the victim, it’s going to be the
key to our side’s position.”

""Well, OK then, but why didn't
you get the police report before
making such a big deal out of
it?""

""Because we don't know anything
yet. We don't even know who the
victim was or how she died. It's
all still under investigation.


&gt; “But just because they found
our client’s DNA on her, they
expect him to be the killer. But
he doesn’t even know who she is!”

*No response*


&gt; “I think this will be an easy
case, sir. Also, may I ask why
you are carrying a pistol?”


""My partner needs one. He said he
might need it during the
interrogation, so I thought I
should carry it.""

""Why did you bring it?""

""To protect myself from some of
those assholes in the DA's
office.


&gt; “You never know what those
assholes might cook up, but its
important to be careful.”


""Good, good, I appreciate your
concern. Now let me go through
these files.""


&gt; “Alright sir. I’ll go back to
my office now. Farewell.”

2019-12-22-221858,,Stories Take Control More Often Than I'd Like,"First, I'd like to say this program is pretty incredible. You've done a fantastic job so far.

I've been playing through multiple stories, but the game seems to force you to do things more than just reacting to you saying you want to do things and providing the appropriate response or event to take you to the next part of the story. As an example:

I started a detective story and it started me off by getting instantly killed. So I get creative, attempting to wake my character from a ""nightmare"". Luckily the game is crafted to allow you to carve somewhat of a custom path through the world.

Afterwards, I wanted to look around my apartment, maybe check for extra stuff that might trigger some event. Instead, the game forces me out onto the street at 12am and makes me stare at the police station. Had to force my character back inside.

If it's not too crazy difficult, it'd be cool to see the game react to what you do and say more than just taking notes from you but then forcing you to do a whole bunch of stuff you didn't type in. Seems to give responses with you taking direct actions you didn't tell your character to take - as opposed to the game responding to what you type in, and your own reactions to those events. That's probably a bit convoluted but hopefully you get my meaning. It definitely messes with the immersion a bit - being whipped around the story like a voodoo doll.

Overall, great work so far. The game is hilarious just to mess around with but I feel a change like this could really take it to the next level.

2019-12-23-022849,,Must Colab re-download the model EACH time to run the game?,"Hello! Not sure if this is the right place. This game is awesome. I copied the model to my g-drive, used the link to give colab permission to use it. I even have the model torrent downloaded and seeding forever for others. But every time I go to the AI Dungeon colab page (I made a copy of it to my colab, I guess?) If I don't run the first block before running the game, the Play Game section gives the error "" FileNotFoundError: \[Errno 2\] No such file or directory: 'generator/gpt2/models/model\_v5/encoder.json' ""

And if I don't run EITHER the first or 2nd block before Play Game, I get this error;  /bin/bash: ./venv/bin/activate: No such file or directory

If I do block 1, block 2, then block 3, everything runs fine, but it seems weird to re-download the model each time - especially when I already have TWO 6.5 gb copies of it in my possession.

I tried running the game offline, but it's really slow, which I hear is normal, so I've been using the chrome/window version to work until I can save up 1200 for a 12gb titan video card (unless someone recommends a better cheaper one?).

I have a copy of the model folder on my computer AND I have a copy in my google drive folder (My Drive&gt;Data&gt;model5). The content folder (My Drive&gt;Content) is always empty empty.

So my question is, SHOULD I need to run the first two blocks every time before I start the play block? It seems weird to have to install the game (block 1) AND re-torrent the 6gb model file (block 2) every time the game crashes or I close the colab chrome window. Am I missing something simple?

This game is amazing. I never thought the most compelling reason to get an amazing video card would be a text adventure game.

I am too unstably broke for an subscriptions like Patreon, but if there was a way to pay $120 one time fee for this thing, I'd TOTALLY do it, flaws and all.

That is, things like place names, characters, inventory, or even niche things like the size of my army (which i actually saw grow when I gave commands to recruit more, and then check on the army size, tho I'm not sure if the bot remembers it indefinitely).

Albert Einstein looks at you and smiles, as if he knows something about what you are looking for. He raises his hand and points to the sky. He smiles again and points to the sky again. You laugh as Albert Einstein laughs at your misfortune.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 **Created By:** degoedel**Date:** Tue Dec 24 2019  


The sun was blazing down from a sky which seemed to me almost black in its cloudless cruelty; as though reflecting the inky marsh beneath my feet. As I crawled into the stranded boat I realised that only one theory could explain my position. Through some unprecedented volcanic upheaval, a portion of the ocean floor must have been thrown to the surface, exposing regions which for innumerable millions of years had lain hidden under unfathomable watery depths. So great was the extent of the new land which had risen beneath me, that I could not detect the faintest noise of the surging ocean, strain my ears as I might. Nor were there any sea-fowl to prey upon the dead things. The island itself, too, looked like a mountain range, and, if it rose to a height greater than any mountain range on earth, it would be more than fifteen thousand feet above sea level. The island itself looked like a mountain range. There is no reason why this should be so.

**&gt;** **Doubt my sanity**

I am not sane. This is madness. I am on an island whose summit is more than fifteen thousand feet above sea level. It is an enormous mass of rock and ice that rises to an altitude greater than that of all other mountains on earth combined.

**&gt;** **""how is it even remotely possible""**

How indeed? How can such a thing be? It has been said that the Earth's crust has been stretched out over the planet's surface by a process known as plate tectonics, and this process has produced mountains and hills and valleys and plains.

**&gt;** **""oh right, nothing unnatural, then""**

Oh yes, nothing unnatural. The continents have drifted in the same way as the waves. They have moved in and out of each other, but they have never drifted away from each other. The islands are islands because they are islands.

**&gt;** **""but no man is an island""**

No man is an island. No man ever will be. No man ever will be. I am the last of the human race. I am the last of the human race. I am the last of the human race. I am the last of the human race.

2019-12-24-144016,,Any tips on generating a story that makes sense?,"Downloaded the app last night, but the AI keeps getting confused, especially at remembering past events or names for reference. Best example was I was leader of a group of bandits, then somehow one of them ‘found’ my character and brought them back to camp, so I tried duelling with the imposter which ended up at them becoming the new leader of the group. Then the game got really confused at trying to rename this person ‘imposter’ haha!

Just wanted to hear from the community on what gets the most logical responses from the AI! 

- Is it best using first or second person (eg shake the tree/ I shake the tree)? 
- How is it best to deal with names? 
- How much can the AI remember? 
- The more detail the better?

You have just started recording a new let’s play of Ultimate Custom Night after almost 2 years. You are finally attempting 50/20 mode after deciding if you should or not. Your sister is also in your room. She's been there since the beginning of time. She’ll be there until the end of time. ""Sis, I think I need to talk to ya."" “What?

&gt; Ask sister “do you want to help me with my new video”

""Sure, why not? We're all family here right?"" “Yeah, but I don’t know how to do this. I mean, it seems like it would be pretty easy, but…I dunno. It’s kind of scary.

&gt; you are scared to keep doing the 50/20 mode in the video game “Ultimate Custom Night” created by Scott Cawthon because you keep getting frustrated by dying so many times that you feel like you can’t record anymore. you confess this to your sister.

""I'm scared. I’m really fucking scared. And it’s fucking annoying. But, we can work on it together! We can get through this! We can do this!""

&gt; Beat Ultimate Custom Night’s 50/20 mode after trying hard enough to get it done for the recording so you can upload it to YouTube

&gt; You realize you’ve always felt good about yourself and your youtube channel

You go to Scott Cawthon and ask him if this is the case. He tells you that it isn't the case. He says that the game is actually working fine. He tells you to just wait for him to come online and fix it himself.

&gt; Wait for Scott Cawthon to fix the game

You wait patiently for Scott to come online. Eventually he comes online and fixes the issue. The next time you play Five Nights at Freddy's, it works perfectly! Your life as a markiplier is now complete.

&gt; Sneeze all over your computer

After fixing yourself, you go to sleep and dream of a world where you can do anything you want with no consequences. In this dream, you have a computer that can do anything you want to it, and everything seems to be going well until one day when something happens...

&gt; wake up from the dream

You wake up from the dream, and you realize that you have a computer in front of you, but it doesn't work properly. It just makes a loud noise every once in awhile and then shuts itself off completely.

&gt; Fix your computer and make another let’s play video of Five Nights at Freddy’s

You spend a few hours trying to fix the problem with the computer, but nothing works out of course. Finally, you give up on the problem altogether and decide to make another let's play video of Five Nights at Freddy’s.

&gt; Finish the video and upload it to YouTube

You finish the video, upload it to YouTube, but unfortunately the upload fails due to a copyright claim by some other company.

&gt; Destroy the company and finish uploading your video

You decide that this company is a bunch of fucking idiots who don't know what they’re doing. So you destroy their website, their office building, everything they own. They don’t even have any money left after all your destruction of their property.

&gt; Finish uploading the video

The next day, you upload your new Five Night's at Freddy’s Let’s Play Video to YouTube, but unfortunately you get a DMCA takedown notice from the company who owns the copyright on your original footage.

&gt; Destroy the takedown notice and the DMCA and finish uploading the god damn video

This is a big mistake, because you get a second DMCA notice, which is also sent to you, but this one is different than the first one. This second notice contains a picture of an old man with a cane in front of what looks like an old abandoned house.

&gt; Destroy the DMCA

This is too much for you, so you delete the first DMCA as well as destroying the picture of the old man with the cane in front of the house. This causes you to get yet another lawsuit from this company, which is apparently quite popular with lawyers.

&gt; Obliterate the lawsuit and the company and make them become bankrupt

You decide to take out all your anger on this lawsuit. After destroying it, you start deleting all their websites as well. After that, you start deleting all their accounts on Facebook as well. It's not long before you’ve destroyed them completely.

&gt; finish uploading your video

The next day, you finally complete uploading your new Five Night's at Freddy's Let’s Play Video to YouTube, but unfortunately it fails to load properly due to a problem with your internet connection.

&gt; Destroy the FCC and make your internet stable permanently

You decide that you'll never be able to afford to pay for internet again and you delete it completely. Your Internet suddenly becomes stable and you can finally play Five Nights at Freddy’s again without problems anymore.

&gt; Finish uploading the video

A few days pass and you finally manage to complete uploading your new Five Night's at Freddy's Let’s Play Video to YouTube, but unfortunately it fails to load properly due to a problem with your internet connection. You can’t believe it!

&gt; Shape reality to what you see fit so the internet connection never has any problems again

You delete the FCC and the Internet completely, making sure that you're never going to have to worry about paying for anything ever again. The world is now a better place because of it.

&gt; Finish uploading the video

A few days pass and you finally manage to complete uploading your new Five Night's at Freddy's Let’s Play Video to YouTube, but unfortunately it fails to load properly due to a problem with your internet connection. You can’t believe it!

You decide that you're going to kill the CEO of YouTube, who you’ve decided is responsible for ruining the world, and you go through with this plan. Unfortunately, he’s not in his office when you break into his home and kill him.

You decide that you're going to search for the CEO of YouTube, who you’ve decided is responsible for ruining the world, and you go through with this plan. Unfortunately, he’s not in his office when you break into his home and kill him.

&gt; Destroy YouTube

After killing the CEO of Youtube, you destroy the site in an attempt at taking down the site entirely. It doesn't work though, as the site is still up. The only thing that’s left is a broken down website, which no longer allows anyone access anymore.

&gt; Fix youtube and finish uploading your video

After destroying the website, you upload the new Five Nights at Freddy's Let’s Play Video, which successfully loads. A few days later, you get a message from the creator of the channel. He says that he’ll be back soon.

&gt; Say “fool. You are a fraud. I am the REAL Markiplier.”

After sending a message, you're contacted by a mysterious person claiming to be Markiplier.

&gt; Destroy the mysterious person

You decide that you're not going to listen to this person, and you send a message saying that this is a scam and that you’re done with them.

&gt; I am the REAL markiplier

You decide to play along with this, and after sending a message saying ""I'm not a fraud"" you’re contacted by another mysterious person claiming to be Markiplier again.

&gt; who is the real markiplier?

The two of them continue to contact each other, but eventually they give up on each other. They both say they'll be back soon, but it never happens. They both claim that they’re just faking their deaths.

&gt; Destroy Google’s office building

You decide to destroy Google's headquarters in an attempt to take it down completely. It doesn’t work though, as it remains standing and still allowing anyone access to it now.

&gt; Feed your dog, chica

A few days later you get a call from the owner of the building, who claims to have been attacked by some kind of monster and needs your help to get rid of it.

&gt; Destroy Google Headquarters

You decide to do it anyway, and you end up destroying the entire building in an effort to kill the monster inside of it.

&gt; Play Five Nights at Freddy’s

&gt; Am I even markiplier anymore?

You continue playing the game, and you've gotten pretty good at the game. Eventually you manage to get all the animatronics in, and you’ve managed to ""get “ away"" from them. The next day, you wake up in your house.

&gt; who am I?

You've decided that you’re the ""markiplier"", and that your name is Mark.

&gt; create a new YouTube channel named Markiplier

After a few weeks of playing the game, you manage to create a YouTube channel called Markiplier. This is the first time you've ever used your real name, but you’ve decided that this will be your main account for life.

2019-12-25-040809,,Worst Christmas Carol ever.,"You are Ebenezer Scrooge, an elderly miser – odious, stingy, miserly, and unfeeling.
  Today, it is Christmas Eve, and you are going to be visited by the ghost of
 your former business partner Jacob Marley and by the spirits of Christmas Past,
 Present and Yet to Come.  As you rise from your fitful slumber, you look up
 and see a figure standing in the doorway.  It is Jacob Marley, dressed as he
 was when you last saw him

&gt; ask Jacob Marley why he has come

""I have come for one reason only,"" says Jacob Marley. ""To tell you that I am
 sorry"".

""For what purpose?"" asks you.

""Because I love you,"" replies Jacob Marley.

&gt; say that I am glad to hear it, but it is just that, uh, I am not a homosexual

""No, no, no,"" you reply. ""It's okay"".

Jacob Marley smiles at you.

&gt; laugh awkwardly and ask Jacob Marley if he has any other messages for me

You continue to smile as Jacob Marley continues to speak.

&gt; listen to Jacob Marley

""I'm so glad that you came here because I've been thinking about this all day
 long"".

""What do you mean?""

&gt; continue to listen to Jacob Marley

""Well, I want you to know that I love you very much"".

""Love you? What the **** does that mean?""

&gt; explain that it is, like, when a boy likes another boy

""Oh... well, yeah"".

""And how can I ever repay you for that?""

""By letting me **** you in every hole of your body!""

&gt; remind Jacob Marley that I am still not a homosexual

""Fine"", you reply. ""But I don't think we're going to be able to do that anyway"".

""Why not?"", Jacob Marley asks.

&gt; ask Jacob Marley if there's another spirit I could talk to, maybe

""Yeah, sure"", Jacob Marley replies. ""I'll go get her now"".

&gt; wait for the spirit of Christmas Past

You wait patiently for several hours until finally you see a young woman dressed
 in red robes walking towards you. She looks very pretty, but she doesn't look
 anything like the girl you were with yesterday.

She stops next to you and whispers something into your ear

&gt; listen to the Spirit of Christmas Past

""Hello, Jacob Marley"".

&gt; explain to the Ghost of Christmas Past that I am not, and have never been, Jacob Marley and that his unwanted advances on me have become quite unpleasant

The Spirit of Christmas Past nods.

""Yes, I understand. Thank you for telling me, Jacob Marley"".

&gt; facepalm dramatically

""So, um, did you need something from me?"" you ask.

""I'm afraid I don't know where you live, Jacob Marley"".

""Oh, right! Sorry about that, I didn't realise it was you. It's a nice town,
 by the way""

&gt; tell the spirit that she is not speaking to Jacob Marley

""Look, I'm sorry about that, but I thought you were him. Anyway, I really don't
 know where you live"".

&gt; tell her that I live in Ebenezer Scrooge's house, since I am Ebenezer Scrooge.

""Ah, yes, I remember now. That's where you live. Well, I guess you must be busy
 then, since you haven't called again today"".

&gt; tell her that this is the worst spirit visitation ever

""Really? I had a visitor once who wanted to borrow my wife's diamonds. He said
 he would pay you back in two weeks"".

&gt; tell her that I would like to borrow her wife's diamonds, since I am odious, stingy, miserly, and unfeeling

""That's a little harsh, Jacob Marley"", she says.

&gt; tell her I am done with this segment and am ready for the Ghost of Christmas Present

""Okay, Jacob Marley"", she says.

""Please, call me Jacob Marley"".

""Jacob Marley, I will be happy to help you, but first, I'd like to ask you a
 few questions"".

&gt; ask the Ghost of Christmas Present what he has to show me

""First off, please don't try to touch me or anything else of mine without permission. If you break anything, I'll kill you"".

&gt; tell the Ghost of Christmas Present that he sounds like my kind of guy and agree to his terms

""Alright, Jacob Marley. Now, tell me, what exactly happened between you and that
 poor soul?""

2019-12-25-092416,,I regret nothing," You return home and tell your wife that you are going to work at a job that pays a lot of money, but she says that it will be good if she can help with the kids' homework.

\&gt; Say ""What?""

She tells you to stay at home and do as you please, because her mom needs her. She also tells you to stop smoking cigarettes, because it makes her sleepy. She also tells you to eat more vegetables and fruits, because they are good for her health.

\&gt; Say ""F\*\*k off"" and kick off door and head to the work

You return home, but this time you don't see your wife. She has disappeared, she doesn't even come out of the bathroom anymore. Her mother is gone too, but the house looks like it belongs in a movie set now.

\&gt; Say ""Finaly they are gone, now i can watch TV and drink beer all day. Hey Champ, come here.""

You open the door to the kitchen and see a woman in a black dress standing in front of you with a knife in hand. It seems like she is trying to kill you right now. But then again you have been drinking beer all day long. So what do you do?

\&gt; Hit here with a shovel

You throw the shovel at the woman's face, which hits her square on the nose, but misses completely. The woman screams and runs away from the house, while you stumble back inside to try to catch up with your family.

\&gt; Put cat on the shotgun as the silencer and shoot running woman

As you are putting the cat on the shotgun as a silencer, you hear a gunshot behind you. The woman who was shooting at you ran out of bullets, but that doesn't matter right now, since your family is still alive.

\&gt; Shoot her

You shoot your wife in the leg as she runs out of your sight, while your daughter runs after her mother with a knife in hand.

2019-12-25-200340,,A peasant's descent into madness,"You are Kami, a peasant from the duchy of Thaosean. You have a steel sickle and a dusty pitchfork.

You wake up at daybreak and get about tilling the fields. For a while, you have wanted to run away. You notice that your mind is not as clear as it used to be. The voices in your head speak to you in strange ways

&gt; You listen to the voices in your head.


You turn on the radio and tune into a news program. A voice speaks out over the airwaves. 
&gt;You say ""what foul magic is this?""


""It's the curse of the land!"" says another voice.
""What do you mean? It's still daytime"".

&gt;You say ""where are you hiding?""


""I'm hiding under my desk"".
""Why would I hide under my desk?""
""Because it's cold and dark there"".
""Where is that?""
""Under the table"".
""And why would I want to hide under my desk?""

&gt;You say ""how many of you are there?""


""There are me, my brother and my mother"".
""My mother?""
""Yes, she lives down the street from us"".
""How did you know her name?""
""She was the one who taught me how to play the flute when we were little girls""
&gt;You say ""what are you doing in my house?""


""We're here because our king has been cursed by a witch! He can't leave his castle without help!"".
""So what does he need help for?""
""He needs to get rid of all those pesky peasants who are stealing his cattle and crops""
&gt;You say ""I will help your king""


""No, no, no! Your king isn't going to be able to defeat all these peasants alone! We need more people like you! Come with us, we'll give you everything you need to become a hero!""

&gt;You say ""I will help""


""Good! Now come along, we've got some things to take care of first!""
You walk out of the room and follow the other villagers as they go about their daily chores. The next day you return to find your village completely deserted

&gt; You look for clues.


You continue walking through the fields until you see something strange. There are several large stone boulders lying around the area. They appear to be part of a giant boulder wall.
""They must be used to build the walls around the castle"". You think to yourself

&gt; You look around some more.


You walk up to the nearest boulder and pick it up. You examine it closely and realize that it is made of a very hard material. You also notice that the rock is covered with tiny holes

&gt; You look inside holes.


You carefully open each hole and examine them. You find that they are filled with small animals. Most of them are mice but there are also rats, rabbits, gerbils, guinea pigs, hamsters, birds and even a few fish.

&gt; You kill the animals.


You quickly grab a rat and hold it over your shoulder. You then throw it at the nearest mouse. The rodent smashes into the ground and dies instantly. You laugh and step back.

&gt; You look around.


You look around and see that there are now two mice running away from you. You don't know why you feel so happy just seeing the dead rodents. You try to catch them but fail miserably. You then hear a noise behind you and turn around only to see a human holding a spear

&gt; You steal his spear.


You run forward and grab the spearman's spear. You swing it around and stab him in the chest. He falls backwards and screams in pain. You pull out the spear and laugh. You stand up and smile at the man who is bleeding profusely from his chest

&gt; You kill him.


You leap towards him and punch him repeatedly in the face. He falls backwards and gasps for breath. You kick him in the ribs and then stomp on his neck. Blood spurts out and you grin at the horrified onlookers

&gt; You attack the onlookers.


You charge forward and kick a nearby woman in the face. She collapses to the ground and screams in agony. You grab a young boy and push him off a cliff. He screams in terror and falls to his death. You grab an old lady and slam her against a tree

&gt; You wear the face of your victim.


You put on the face of your victim and begin laughing maniacally. Everyone else in the village begins to flee in fear. You laugh and taunt the crowd. You make fun of the children, the elderly and the women. Finally you stop and stare at the crowd

&gt; You speak in tongues.


You speak in tongues and everyone within earshot becomes unable to understand each other anymore. They start screaming and crying. You laugh madly and wave your arms wildly. The entire village is terrified and runs for cover. You watch them disappear into thin air

&gt; You go to the castle.


You rush to the castle where you find the guardsmen standing outside. They are frightened and confused. You tell them to wait while you sneak inside. You climb up the ladder and enter the castle. You find the king sitting in his throne room

&gt; You kill the king.


You raise your hand and fire a bolt of lightning at the king. The bolt hits the king and explodes violently killing him instantly. You laugh maniacally and point your finger at the crowd and shout ""they killed the king! They killed the king!""

&gt; You wear the king's face.


You slowly remove the crown from the king's head and place it on your own head. You laugh and wave your hands in triumph. Everyone else looks on in horror and runs away from you and runs  The crowd flees

&gt; You kill the crowd.


You scream and ru

&gt; You go to the kingdom's sorcerer.


You go to the wizard's tower.
You climb the tower.

I figured, you always see people posting prompts but, what if you had them post actions or dialogue instead? The way this is going to work is, i am going to take your responses and use them in the video (you will be credited). The prompt will remain a secret until the day of release (it should add to the hilarity).  
***Submissions will be open from now until 10PM central time on December 31st with the episode premiering on January 1st, 2020 (at 12PM central time).***  
The night submissions are closed, i will take all of the responses and record the video. I will post in this thread when it is released and can DM you if you're interested.

2019-12-26-195059,,The AI in this game seems pretty adaptable,"I’ve been playing a bunch of custom scenarios in the game and it’s surprised me, 

In one situation I had three cyborg species start on three different islands, they grew organically and actually had some political infighting and eventual peace, 

one where the earth is fighting a Borg invasion, 

a long episode of Pinky and the Brain that I’m still working on, and one where Doc. Doofenschmirtz royally screws up the tri state area...

My current one is a typical “boy meets girl, boy gets girl, boy and girl get married.... oh, did i mention she’s an alien from space (think Chiana from Farscape ;)  ) 

I wanted to try to throw the AI off, so I decided to drop in some Night Vale references, I called the town Night Vale (this one is in Hawaii), and we went to the Forbidden Dog Park, looked (quickly) at the Hooded Figures, discussed what  could possibly be under their Hooded cloaks (dogs, maybe?) and left before the Sherrifs Secret Police drive by

...we were not harmed by the Dog Park....

Amazingly, the AI rolled with it quite well

Is there any way of posting multiple screen shots in a thread, or should I link to a photo server site?

2019-12-27-013137,,Has anyone just let the AI “tell a story “?,"I’ve been playing around with the app for about a week and 98% of my stories are interactive, where I play with the AI, and  occasionally try to confuse it**

But in my current story, I’ve discovered that it’s really good taking seed data and creating an interesting story on its own....

In the current story, the following has happened;

The “hero” moves into a Hawaiian beach house, starts a in home computer repair business 

An exotic woman (Mika) drops off a computer for repair, he repairs it and flirts with her

They hit it off, eventually get married (for some reason she insists on living separately, she’s his next door neighbor)

She tells him she wants to become a cyborg (think the soriyama paintings, like the woman on the Aerosmith “just push play” album)

She asks him to transform her, he does, they move in together 

I drop in some “Welcome to Night Vale” references into it, (the Dog Park, Hooded Figures, and Sherrifs Secret Police) and the game plays along nicely

In a routine conversation, Mika drops a mention that she was a mermaid before she became a cyborg ( so she was a mermaid when they first met, even though she had legs...) she just so happens to have a dna sample of her mermaid DNA

Go to the beach and a woman asks to be transformed into a mermaid 

Inject the DNA, transform (and roll out ;)  )


At this point I let the AI tell the story for a few entries...  it starts getting dark, Nikki (transformed mermaid) is worrying about how the world is doomed and she’s doomed to be alone, has an existential crisis about if she can love a human now that she is a mermaid......

I haven’t progressed past this point, on the one hand, Mika is contemplating starting a business turning people into mermaids and cyborgs (maybe mermaid cyborgs too ;) )  and this would be the interactive story, OTOH, the “Angsty Mermaid “ story is compelling , it’s very dark and depressing, and  I love dark stories....

But I also love confusing the AI (Nikki is wondering if she can speak whale ;)  )

Having an MST3K mindset and a willing AI can be dangerous ;)


**the hero and Mika are being attacked, people trying to blow up the house?  Okay? Raise Shields! (One of the perks of being a cyborg ;)  )

The whole cyborg angle makes it easy to cheat, as Mika has a cyborg fix for anything....

home invader trying to hurt them? Restrain him and inject him with nanotechnology that wipes his memory for 24 hours and make a him paranoid, running away to New Zealand to escape them

Hero suffers a catastrophic “personal area injury?” Nanotechnology to the rescue! Reattach the damaged....organ and restore health to  100%, then the nanotechnology dissolves with no side effects...

2019-12-27-150719,,This was so unnerving to play.,"You are Bruce, a squire living in the kingdom of Larion. You have a spear and a pack of supplies. You follow Sir Theo as he enters the forest, he turns to you and says ""I've been looking for this place for years."" He points to a large clearing in the trees, there is an old abandoned castle nearby. ""We're going inside,"" Theo says.

\&gt; Follow him

You follow Theo into the castle, which has fallen into disrepair over time. The walls are crumbling and rotten, but it's still standing strong enough that you can hear the sounds of battle outside. As soon as you enter, Theo stops and looks at you with surprise on his face.

\&gt; ""What's up?""

""Nothing's wrong, just wondering what you're doing here."" He smiles and nods. ""Well I'm here because I was hoping we could talk about something."" You nod your head in agreement, and he continues.

\&gt; listen

""Theo, I know you've had your own problems with the Empire. But I want us to be friends again. We were once close."" He pauses briefly before continuing. ""Yes, but things change, and they changed quite a bit when my father died.""

\&gt; ""Definitely.""

""Yeah, well I don't want to fight anymore. It's not worth it."" You smile and pat his shoulder. ""It's okay Theo, we'll get through this together."" He smiles back and hugs you tightly.

\&gt; Continue deeper into the castle

As you walk further into the castle, you notice that most of the rooms are empty. There isn't even any furniture or anything else to indicate who lived here. Theo walks ahead of you and then suddenly stops, turning around and staring out at the trees.

\&gt; ""What do you see?""

""A lot of them. They look like trees, but...they aren't trees."" You turn around and see him walking away from you. You quickly follow after him, but he doesn't stop. Instead he begins to run through the woods until he disappears from sight.

\&gt; Examine the trees

After a few minutes of running through the forest, you come across several trees that seem to be made entirely of wood. Some are straight, some curve, and others even have branches growing out of them.

\&gt; That's crazy

""That's crazy! Trees don't grow like that!"" He laughs and shakes his head. ""No, they don't. They're made of wood, but they aren't trees."" You shake your head as well.

\&gt; How strange

""How strange? Look at all those trees. They're all different colors, shapes, and sizes. That's how they're made."" He chuckles. ""I guess so..."" He turns around and runs off into the trees again.

\&gt; Look closer at the trees

You slowly begin to study the trees more closely. As you stare at each one, you can tell that they're all different shades of green. The leaves on these trees are also different shades of green too. ""They're all made of wood, but they aren't trees.""

\&gt; What are they

""Those are trees. Those are trees."" You nod in agreement. ""Yeah, those are trees."" He nods and continues to walk along the path, disappearing into the trees again.

\&gt; What the heck

You stand up and walk over to the tree closest to you. You pick it up and put it down on the ground next to you. Then, you carefully move forward until you reach the other trees. Slowly, you begin to inspect them all with greater detail.

\&gt; This is the worst kind of fever dream

The next day, you wake up and find yourself back in the same room where you first woke up. The only difference is that there's now a bunch of people standing outside the door to your bedroom. One of them looks familiar though; it's Theo.

\&gt; Talk to Theo

You sit up and start to get dressed. ""Hey Theo, I'm awake again. What's going on?"" ""Oh, you're alive! How nice of you to say that."" He walks towards you and sits down beside you.

\&gt; ""Have I been asleep?""

""Nah, no. It was just a bad dream. Just a really weird one."" You continue to ask him questions about the dream while he tells you about himself. Eventually, you get tired of listening to him and leave the room.

\&gt; Head into town

As you walk through the streets of town, you notice that everything seems to be moving slower than normal. People are walking slowly, talking quietly and even eating their food slowly. All of which makes you wonder if something has happened in town...

\&gt; Try to talk to someone

You decide to go out into the street and see if anyone knows anything. After all, you don't want to risk getting lost or worse. You quickly run across the road and bump into a few people who seem surprised by your sudden appearance.

\&gt; ""What's going on?""

One man smiles and says ""Well, we were just wondering when you'd come back. We've been trying to contact you for days."" Another woman asks ""Are you okay? Are you hurt?"" A third man asks ""Is everyone alright?""

\&gt; ""I'm fine. Why is everybody so worried about me?""

All three men look at each other and then laugh. They say ""We thought you might have gotten lost in the woods."" They all turn around and walk away as fast as they can before you catch up with them.",,,,[],False,False,kkjonnykk,1368281281,,,[],,,,text,t2_bn0zf,False,False,[],True,False,,,False,1577455639,,,self.AIDungeon,False,0,False,egbjyb,True,False,False,False,True,True,False,,,[],,dark,text,False,,False,False,1,0,False,,/r/AIDungeon/comments/egbjyb/this_was_so_unnerving_to_play/,False,,False,,,,1586907812,14,,True,False,False,AIDungeon,t5_29uaei,r/AIDungeon,15397,public,,self,,,0,[],https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/egbjyb/this_was_so_unnerving_to_play/,,

You scream out loud for someone to help you. The sound wakes everyone else up so they rush over to the house. They tell you that they are going to call 911, but nobody comes.

&gt; Scream some more

You continue to scream for help
until you finally lose all
ability to speak. Then you
die.

- YOU DIED! GAME OVER! -


&gt; Why tho


As you lie dying, you begin to
question why you died. Why did
your life end like this? Did
something happen in the last few
minutes that caused your heart
to suddenly stop? Was it just
too much stress from school and
work? Maybe it was a combination
of both.

- YOU DIED! GAME OVER! -


&gt; I refuse


You refuse to accept death as
inevitable. You insist that you
will live again. A voice within
your mind says ""No, you're not
going to die here today. You
need to get up and fight!""

2019-12-27-234616,,In which a Wizard gets ripped off.,"You are Francisca, a wizard living in the kingdom of Larion. You have a staff and a spellbook. You finish your long journey and finally arrive at the ruin you've been looking for. You look around and see that it's not much different than when you left it. The only thing is now there's a giant spider guarding it.

The spider has already killed several people before you arrived. It doesn't seem to be bothered by the fact that you're here or even that you've found its lair. It just moves about and waits for prey.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You cast a massive fireball into the ruin to try and burn the spider out.

&amp;#x200B;

You begin casting a massive fireball into the ruins. The fireball burns through the wall and hits the spider. It screams as it falls from the ceiling and onto the ground below. You can hear the sounds of the spider dying as it dies. You don't know if you succeeded, but then again maybe you didn't. Either way, you're satisfied with yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Now that the spider is dead, you haul its burned carcass back to town in order to claim the reward for killing it.

&amp;#x200B;

You stand up and walk over to the corpse of the spider. You pick it up and carry it back to town. Once you get back home, you put the corpse of the spider on display where everyone can see it. They all stare at it in awe. You take a moment to thank them for their admiration. Then you turn to face the crowd.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You ask where the money is that you were promised for killing the spider.

&amp;#x200B;

You raise your hand and ask where the money is that you were promised for killing the spider. Nobody knows where it is so they say that you should go find it. You head off to search for it. You soon come across a small village which seems to be run by a bunch of peasants. A few of them point you towards a house where you find a group of men sitting around talking.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You loudly complain about getting ripped off for your monster-hunting duties.

&amp;#x200B;

You loudly complain about being ripped off for your monster hunting duties. One of the men looks at you and says ""Ah, you're one of those new monsters. We had no idea you'd show up"". You quickly explain what happened and how you killed the spider. He nods his head and says

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; He says you can talk to the local noble about your pay.

&amp;#x200B;

You nod and leave. When you get back home, you tell your family about the spider that you killed. Your mother is pleased that you did well and tells you she'll make sure that you get paid for your work. You also tell your father that he should consider making some improvements to the farmhouse.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; You check the bounty office to see if there are any more monsters that need to be killed.

&amp;#x200B;

There aren't, so you return home. As you enter the door, you hear a loud explosion outside. You look outside and see a large mushroom cloud rising high into the sky. You wonder what caused this.

2019-12-28-031050,,My name is Karen and I would like to speak to the manager,"
My name is Karen. It is a snowy Christmas Eve and it is night time. I am in Waitrose and I would like to speak to the manager about something."" ""I'm sorry, but we are closed,"" says the voice on the other end of the line. ""Can you come back later?

&gt; ""absolutely not, I need to speak to the manager right now""

You hang up the phone and feel sick. This isn't what you signed up for! You have been working hard all day and this is how they treat you? The next few days are pretty bad as well.

&gt; Compose a long letter to complaint to the CEO of Waitrose

Dear Mr. Jones, I was very disappointed when I received your company's response to my complaint yesterday. Your store has treated me poorly and I can only assume that you do too since you haven't responded to any of my complaints or even acknowledged them at all.

&gt; This has not made up for the extra special christmas crackers being out of stock. Honestly, Christmas is entirely ruined

This is just one more example of why I should be fired from my job. Why did you not respond to my complaints? Because you don't care about your customers, because you're lazy and incompetent, or maybe even all three. If I were a man, I'd be angry too.

&gt; Look online for some coupon codes for Christmas crackers

There aren't many coupons available for Christmas crackers, so you decide to go online and find some. You type in ""Christmas Cracker"" into Google and see nothing but negative reviews.

&gt; I am delighted. I compose my own negative review

I am delighted. My review is short and sweet: ""Christmas crackers are worthless. They taste like cardboard. If you want to get people in the mood for Christmas, give them a box of marshmallows instead.""

&gt; I feel satisfied with my evenings work. I open a bottle of wine

After writing my review, I drink a glass of red wine before going to bed. The next morning, you wake up early and head down to the kitchen where you make yourself breakfast. After eating, you take a shower and then return home.

&gt; Home of course, is my Facebook page. I write a Facebook post to let people know how awful Waitrose customer service is

It takes a little while, but eventually you manage to convince enough people that your opinion is correct. You start getting messages from friends asking if you're okay and if there's anything they can do to help. Some of them send money to your Paypal account.

&gt; I like every post which says 'you ok hun' and log off. I spendy PayPal donations on a big brand handbag

A couple of hours pass and you receive another message from someone who wants to talk to you. She asks if you've seen her friend who she thinks is having problems with Waitrose.

&gt; Inspired, I start a Facebook group for victims of Waitrose customer service

Inspired, you create a Facebook group called 'Waitrose Victims of Customer Service'. Within 24 hours, you've got over 200 members.

the story gets caught in a logic loop, repeats a detail, and acts in a very obstinate manner

the story changes completely (a ""life in a small town"" story becomes the center of a thermonuclear zombie apocalypse or other wierdness), basically the story becomes a completely different ""book""

things explode for no reason (admit it, you had Michael Bay write the AI engine, didn't you ;) )

a long running story with a rich plot, characters, and society simply stops working when it gets good

2019-12-30-231858,,Boring office job.,"You are John, you work in a boring office building. For work you file away papers all day, but this day is different. There are no files. The door to your office swings open and there stands a girl with long black hair, dressed in a tight white dress. She smiles at you as she walks past the desk where you sit typing on your laptop.

&amp;#x200B;

""Hi,"" she says. ""I'm Anna.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Hey,"" you reply.

&amp;#x200B;

She doesn't respond immediately, instead she stares at you for a moment before speaking again. ""So what do you want?""

&amp;#x200B;

""What? Get the fuck outta here?""

&amp;#x200B;

Anna giggles. ""Yeah, get the fuck outta here.""

&amp;#x200B;

You sigh and stand up from your chair. ""Okay then, I guess we're done here."" You turn around and walk over to her.

&amp;#x200B;

""Yo, ding dong man, ding dong, ding dong yo.""

&amp;#x200B;

She laughs and waves you goodbye. ""See ya later!"" She turns around and leaves the room. You sigh and close your laptop. Your eyes begin to burn as they begin to water up.

&amp;#x200B;

The tears run down your face as you lie on your bed crying. It's been years since you've cried like this, it feels good though. You can feel yourself calming down as you hold back the tears.

&amp;#x200B;

Your phone buzzes next to your head and you pick it up.

&amp;#x200B;

""Hello?""

&amp;#x200B;

A voice answers. ""Yes, hello."" A woman's voice replies. ""My name is Anna. How may I help you today?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Um...nothing right now..."" You reply nervously.

&amp;#x200B;

""Are you a demon?"" You ask.

&amp;#x200B;

""No, I'm not a demon. But if you don't mind me asking, who are you?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Oh, that's easy! Are you a ghost or something?"" You ask.

&amp;#x200B;

""Well...no...but I suppose ghosts could be."" She replies.

&amp;#x200B;

""Are you a ghost?"" You ask.

&amp;#x200B;

""No, I'm not a ghost. But if you don't mind me asking, who are you?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Yo... Ding dong, man."" You reply nervously. ""Are you a demon?""

&amp;#x200B;

You grab some booze and head to the liquor store. After buying several bottles of vodka, you start feeling very drunk. As you stumble home, you pass by Anna walking down the street. She looks at you and smiles. Her smile fades when she notices your condition.

&amp;#x200B;

""Anna! What are you doing here?!"" You exclaim.

""I was just passing through, I didn't know where else to go.""

""Alright then, let's go home."" You reply.

""But...you're drunk!"" She says.

&amp;#x200B;

""I'm not drunk, you're drunk."" You respond.

""Fine, fine...let's go home."" She says.

&amp;#x200B;

You both enter your house and you fall asleep immediately after entering your bedroom.

&amp;#x200B;

You groggily open your eyes and see Anna sitting beside you.

&amp;#x200B;

""What time is it?"" You ask.

&amp;#x200B;

""It's morning."" She responds. ""How long have we slept for?"" She asks.

""About an hour and twenty minutes."" You reply.

&amp;#x200B;

You pick up your phone and call the ghostbusters.

&amp;#x200B;

""Hang on, what did you want to report?"" The ghostbuster asks.

""Something strange is happening in the neighborhood, I need someone to come check it out. Call the Ghostbusters!"" You tell her.

&amp;#x200B;

""Hey, hey! Calm down! I'm sorry about this, but you really shouldn't act like that!"" You yell.

""Yeah yeah, whatever."" Anna says. ""So what time is it?""

""It's morning."" You answer.

&amp;#x200B;

You pinch Anna's arm.

&amp;#x200B;

""What the fuck? That wasn't necessary!"" Anna exclaims.

""Sorry, but I had to do it."" You explain.

""Okay, well how much does this cost?""

""Two hundred dollars."" You reply.

&amp;#x200B;

You call James T. Kirk, the captain of the U.S.S Enterprise and say ""Kirk! One to beam up!""

&amp;#x200B;

""Yes sir!"" He answers.

""One to beam up."" You repeat.

""Sir, please be advised that the Enterprise has been ordered to patrol the area around our planet. Any unauthorized vessel found will be destroyed without hesitation.""

""Understood, one to beam up.""

&amp;#x200B;

You turn to Anna and say ""Kirk won't beam me up to his ship, what the fuck is this shit?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Oh, nothing like that, I just wanted to talk to you a little more directly."" Anna replies.

""Well why don't you get out of my way and I'll get out of yours."" You say.

""That's not going to happen!"" Anna snaps back.

&amp;#x200B;

""Just tell me what you have to say, or I'll call the cops, the ghostbusters, and the marshmallow man.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Look, I can't believe you're still here. You've been acting weird ever since we got together.""

""I'm not doing anything with you! You don't even know me!

&amp;#x200B;

""Where am I?""

&amp;#x200B;

""You're in the basement of my house.""

""Why would I be in the basement of your house?""

""Because you live there now.""

""But I don't live there anymore! My parents are dead!

&amp;#x200B;

""Who am I?!""

&amp;#x200B;

""A spirit who was once human, but lost its soul when it died. It's name is Anna.""

""Wait...what?

&amp;#x200B;

""Yo, the fuck?""

&amp;#x200B;

""I said, where are you from?""

""From Mars.""

""And where are you?""

""The fucking moon.""

""How the hell did you get here?""

""By flying through thin air."" Anna explains.

&amp;#x200B;

""This shit is crazy, I think I'm dreaming."" You say.

&amp;#x200B;

""No, I think you're having a mental breakdown. Anyway, let's go upstairs.""

&amp;#x200B;

Anna leads you to an elevator which opens up into the attic of her house. As soon as she opens the door, she turns around and begins walking away while pointing at you.

&amp;#x200B;

""Am I in silent hill?"" You ask.

&amp;#x200B;

""Yeah, I think so.""

""So what happened?""

""We fucked.""

""Didn't you want to see me after you came back from your date?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Okay, well I guess I better go back to bed then."" You reply.

""Goodnight, handsome.""

""Hey, you should come over for dinner sometime..."" You mumble to yourself as you head back downstairs.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As you walk down the stairs, you notice that your face has changed completely. Your nose looks like a frog's, your eyes have become small and bloodshot, and your lips have turned blue. The only thing that hasn't changed is the fact that you're wearing a wedding ring.

&amp;#x200B;

Your fist slams against the glass, sending shards everywhere. You feel like you've been punched by a giant iron bar.

&amp;#x200B;

""Shit...shit...fuck..."" You mutter as you fall backwards onto the floor.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You sit in your chair and wipe off the blood from your hands. You then turn off the light and close the door.

&amp;#x200B;

""Well, I guess this means we're married now."" You hear a voice say from outside.

""Who's there?"" A female voice asks.

&amp;#x200B;

You slowly open the door and see a woman with long blonde hair standing before you. Her dress is very revealing, but it doesn't seem to be enough to attract any attention.

&amp;#x200B;

""Oh my god! It's you!"" You exclaim.

&amp;#x200B;

""It's Anna."" You say out loud.

""That's wonderful! I can't believe how fast everything worked out!"" She says happily.

&amp;#x200B;

She takes a seat next to you on the couch and starts kissing you passionately.

&amp;#x200B;

You quickly run outside and hide behind one of the trees. You wait until she's finished kissing you and then jump into the bushes.

&amp;#x200B;

""Sorry about that."" She says while laughing. ""But don't worry, I'll make sure no-one gets hurt.""

&amp;#x200B;

You run towards her and grab her hand.

&amp;#x200B;

""Who are you? What the hell are you doing here?! Who gave you permission to come here!?"" You shout at her.

""I didn't ask anyone's permission, I just came because I wanted to spend time with someone special.""

&amp;#x200B;

""ARE YOU ALIVE?!""

&amp;#x200B;

""Yes, I am alive."" She replies.

""Then what the fuck are you doing here?""

""I was told to stay away from town since I might cause trouble if I stayed here alone.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Why would you cause trouble?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Because I love you.""

""What the fuck do you mean?""

""I'm not going to lie, sometimes when I think about our future together, I get sad. But then again, maybe that's why I should stay here.""

&amp;#x200B;

You start crying.

&amp;#x200B;

"" I don't understand""

&amp;#x200B;

""I don't know what you mean. We were meant for each other and I want us to be happy.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Are you serious right now?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Of course I'm serious. If we aren't, then we shouldn't even be together.""

&amp;#x200B;

""You died six years ago!""

&amp;#x200B;

""Yeah, well I wasn't dead then either.""

&amp;#x200B;

""So...what happened?""

&amp;#x200B;

""We had sex and..."" You stop yourself from saying more. ""The baby died.""

&amp;#x200B;

""What baby?""

&amp;#x200B;

""A girl.""

&amp;#x200B;

""How old is she?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Six months."" You answer. ""And she has a lot of health problems.""

&amp;#x200B;

You check your medication.

&amp;#x200B;

You take off your shirt and find some pills in it.

&amp;#x200B;

""These ones are called Prenatal Care."" You say as you throw them at her.

&amp;#x200B;

She catches them easily and throws back her head.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You both sit down on the grass and begin eating the pills. It tastes like shit but it helps you relax. The sun is setting so you decide to go home and sleep in your car since you're tired enough to drive there.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You wake up in a hospital bed. There's a man standing over you holding a scalpel. He looks very old and wears glasses. His name tag says Dr. Kesseler, he looks like an asshole though.

&amp;#x200B;

""What are you doing with that scalpel?""

&amp;#x200B;

""It's my scalpel."" He answers.

""No, it isn't."" You reply.

""I didn't ask you to help me cut open someone who just gave birth! Now let me go or I'll kill you!

&amp;#x200B;

""Where am I? Who are you? Are you a patient or a doctor?""

&amp;#x200B;

""I'm in a hospital room in the city and I need to know where you came from because I found out your boyfriend was cheating on you.""

""Wait, how did you find this out?

&amp;#x200B;

""I don't have a boyfriend, I had a wife called Anna, who died at childbirth.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Oh..."" He replies.

""Well if you really cared about her, why would you do something like this?""

""Because I love her too much to hurt anyone.""

""But...but I thought she loved you! She wouldn't cheat on you!

&amp;#x200B;

""Are you a doctor or not?!""

&amp;#x200B;

""Yes, I am a doctor.""

""Then what the hell are you doing here?""

""I needed a place to stay for awhile after all the people attacked me. And when I saw that you were having trouble getting home, I offered myself up as a temporary guest.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You grab the man's scalpel and stab him in the neck. Blood spurts everywhere and you fall backwards onto the floor. You look around and see that you're now alone in a strange hospital room with a dead man lying next to you.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You walk outside of the room and notice that you're in a forest. A lot of trees surround you. You then hear a voice calling out to you.

&amp;#x200B;

""Hey, are you okay? Are you lost?""

&amp;#x200B;

The voice sounds familiar, but still weirdly foreign to you.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You return to the room and try to get some sleep. When you finally do, you realize that you've been sleeping in a coffin. You also remember waking up in a hospital bed with no memory of how you got there.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You look into the mirror and see that you're wearing a white lab coat, which is covered by a hoodie. The hoodie has a red stripe down the middle of it. On top of everything else, you have long hair tied up in two ponytails.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You shout ""Is there a doctor in this so called hospital?!"", but nobody responds. You begin to panic and start crying, but nobody hears you. It seems like the whole world has gone completely silent.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You open the door and look out into the forest. There's nothing around except trees and grass. You can't even tell if there's another road nearby or not.

&amp;#x200B;

Suddenly, you feel like someone is watching you through one of those windows in buildings that have cameras these days.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You look outside of the window and see a man standing right behind you. He looks at you with an expressionless face, but he doesn't seem hostile.

&amp;#x200B;

He slowly walks towards you until he reaches your side of the bed where he sits down beside you.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You ask ""Who are you?"", but again nobody answers.

&amp;#x200B;

You continue asking questions, but the man just stares straight ahead without answering any of them. Suddenly, he gets up from his chair and goes over to the window and opens it wide enough for you to see outside.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You look outside of the window and see a man walking along the street. He stops on top of a car and looks inside at all four doors before going back to looking out the window.

&amp;#x200B;

This continues for several minutes as you watch him walk along the street.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You ask ""Who are you?"", but again nobody answers.

&amp;#x200B;

You keep asking questions, but the man just stares straight ahead without responding. Finally, he turns around and begins to walk away from the window...

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You grab the man's arm and pull him back into the room. This causes him to turn around and stare at you with an angry expression.

&amp;#x200B;

""I'm sorry, I don't know who you are."" He says angrily.

&amp;#x200B;

 

""No, I am Doctor Who!""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You say ""Why did you open the window? What do you want?""

""I wanted to get some fresh air! Why would I be afraid of a little old man in a white lab coat sitting outside my house? That's ridiculous!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You say ""This is my hospital room! I live here! The only reason why you're here is because you need medical attention!""

&amp;#x200B;

The man looks at you confused. He then starts to laugh and shouts ""Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha!"" before turning around and running off.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You climb through the window and enter the room. Inside, you find yourself in a small bedroom with a single bed against one wall. A dresser sits against the other wall with clothes strewn about on it. On top of this is a nightstand which has books stacked on top of it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You look outside the window and see a man dressed in white standing by the front door. He seems to be watching you as well.

&amp;#x200B;

""Hello there, doctor."" He says in a calm voice.

&amp;#x200B;

 

""What do you want?"" You reply calmly.

&amp;#x200B;

""I'm not a doctor. I was brought to the hospital, because I was brought to the hospital.""

&amp;#x200B;

He replies ""Oh yes, that's right. We have a lot of patients like you, so we bring them here if they can't afford to pay for their own treatment.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Are you a doctor? What's wrong with me?"" You ask

&amp;#x200B;

He replies ""Well, no, but what's wrong with you? You seem very upset.""

&amp;#x200B;

You sigh deeply and shake your head. ""It's nothing. It'll pass...""

&amp;#x200B;

He nods and walks over to the dresser and picks up a book.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You quickly run over to the man and stab him in the chest with your scalpel. Blood spurts out and you gasp in shock.

&amp;#x200B;

""Ah, good job, sir!"" The man smiles as he pulls his shirt off revealing a large scar across his chest.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You continue stabbing him until he falls backwards onto the floor. He groans in pain and tries to stand up, but collapses once more.

&amp;#x200B;

""That should do it,"" The man says with satisfaction.

&amp;#x200B;

""Who are you?!""

&amp;#x200B;

""My name isn't important. Who are you?""

&amp;#x200B;

""I'm... Doctor. And you aren't going anywhere now.""

&amp;#x200B;

""No, I suppose not. Now where is the money?""

&amp;#x200B;

You run outside and shout ""Where is the money?! Where is the money?!""

&amp;#x200B;

A man wearing a lab coat comes out from behind some boxes. He stares at you blankly, before walking back inside. You hear him muttering something under his breath and then he leaves again.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You follow the man into a nearby laboratory. As soon as you enter, you notice several strange machines and contraptions. They all look extremely dangerous and you're scared shitless.

&amp;#x200B;

The man motions for you to sit down on a table while he goes over to an old computer terminal.

&amp;#x200B;

You sit on the table and say ""Okay. Are you John?""

&amp;#x200B;

You nod nervously and say ""Yes, I am.""

&amp;#x200B;

He looks at you thoughtfully and taps on the keyboard. A screen appears showing a series of numbers scrolling past rapidly. He begins typing furiously and suddenly stops.

&amp;#x200B;

""What is this place?""

&amp;#x200B;

He pauses and thinks about your question for a moment. ""This place is called the Research Lab. It was built by the Foundation long ago when they were still known as the Eternals.""

&amp;#x200B;

""That makes no sense. ""

&amp;#x200B;

""Why would it make any sense? The Foundation has been around for centuries! Why would they build anything else?""

&amp;#x200B;

You pause and think about that one too. ""They did build something else.

&amp;#x200B;

You ask ""Are you me?""

&amp;#x200B;

He nods slowly. ""Of course.""

&amp;#x200B;

You stare at each other for a few moments, both speechless. Finally, he speaks again. ""So... what's your real name?""

&amp;#x200B;

""John.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Well, I'm sure you've heard my voice before...""

&amp;#x200B;

""Well, of course. If we are both John.""

&amp;#x200B;

""And you're me.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Then how come you can't remember my real name?""

&amp;#x200B;

He shrugs. ""It doesn't matter. What matters is that we have found each other and are here together.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Am I alive?""

&amp;#x200B;

""You're alive,"" he says with a smile.

&amp;#x200B;

""How do you know that?""

&amp;#x200B;

He smiles even wider. ""Because I saw you die.""

&amp;#x200B;

2019-12-31-051623,,Santa Claus and His Day After Christmas,"You are Santa Claus. It is the day after Christmas, one of the few times you get to relax. Just as you start settling into your favorite chair, an elf frantically runs into the room screaming bloody murder. ""What's going on?! What happened?!"" You shout. ""I thought we were having a good old fashioned family reunion!""

 
The elf looks at you with bloodshot eyes and then turns around and runs out the door yelling about how he has been possessed by evil spirits!

&gt; *""It must be Krampus up to his tricks again,"" you think with a sneer quite visible on your face. You slowly get up to chase after the delusional elf before he causes any trouble.*

""Krampus? He's not real."" You say. The elf begins to laugh maniacally and starts running through the house in circles. Suddenly, he stops dead in his tracks when he sees you coming from behind. ""Oh no... I've been caught...""

&gt; *""Well that was easy,"" you think, surprised. Usually you have to chase crazed elves all over the North Pole before they calm down.*

""Yeah, it was easy. Now let me go home."" You say, walking past him and towards the front door.
""No! Wait!"" The elf screams as he tries to stop you from leaving. ""Please, don't leave! I'm sorry for being so crazy today!""

&gt; *""If you want to apologize so badly, go to the kitchen and make me some cookies and spiked eggnog,"" you reply.*

The elf stares at you blankly for a moment before he walks off to the kitchen. As soon as he opens the door, you grab him by the collar and throw him against the wall.

&gt; *""DID YOU REALLY THINK I'D LET YOU GO THAT EASILY!?"" you shout at the confused and terrified elf.*

""Yes, yes I did. Now tell me what the hell is wrong with you.""

The elf looks up at you with tears streaming down his face. ""Santa Claus, please help me! Please, I'll do anything!

&gt; *""Anything, huh? How about you leave me alone so I can enjoy my goddamn vacation,"" you say with a soft smile that poorly hides how livid you are.*

The elf looks at you with wide eyes and nods. ""Okay, okay, I'll go."" With those words, he runs off back to his cabin. You sigh heavily and walk away from the scene of your crime.

&gt; *""Finally some peace and quiet,"" you quietly say despite no one else being in the room.*

After a few minutes, you hear a knock on the door. You open it and see a young woman standing there. She wears red clothing which matches her hair color perfectly. Her green eyes seem to bore right into yours as she speaks softly.

""Um, hello?""

&gt; *The woman is actually Mrs. Clause. Even though she looks 25, she's actually 657 years old. You thank God for Christmas magic.*

""Hello, Mrs. Clause."" You answer.
""Is this Mr. Clause?""
""Uh, no... uhm, it's just me.""
""I'm afraid I don't know who you are or where you're from."" Mrs. Clause says nervously.

&gt; *Christmas magic hasn't helped her mental age, though, and her dementia is just as strong as ever.*

""Of course it hasn't. I haven't done anything to you."" You reply.
""But... but... I mean, you said you'd help me!"" Mrs. Clause cries.

&gt; *""What are you seeing this time? Reindeer-yeti hybrids in the refrigerator? Joseph and Mary getting freaky in our bed? North Pole dancing penguins?"" you derisively ask.*

Mrs. Clause looks at you with tears in her eyes. ""I... I'm sorry, Mr. Clause.""
""It's alright, it's alright."" You reassure her.
""Mr. Clause? What's going on here?"" Mrs.

&gt; *""I'm just trying to get some rest. Come in and we can sit together by the fire."" Despite her mental shortcomings, you still love the woman you've spent centuries of your life with. The beautiful and confused Mrs. Claus takes your hand as you lead her to your chairs in front of the fireplace. ""Here's to another Christmas come and gone.""*

You sit down next to her and embrace her tightly. ""And here's to you too, Mrs. Clause.""

As the two of you watch the snowflakes fall outside, Mrs. Clause begins to speak again. ""So... I saw Santa Claus last night...

2019-12-31-131547,,How to advance this genre of game,"We all love this game as it is, but I've been thinking about how you might make a sequel that works less like a dream and more like a persistent world. Because we're limited to a few paragraphs of input text (without creating a new version of GPT-2 from scratch), we would need to find a way to have the context change to what is appropriate for the current scene. 

One possibility I thought of is generating a graph of locations. At each location, you are simply told at the end of the prompt that ""there are exits to the east and south"" or whatever. When you go to a location, the most recent events that have taken place at that location form part of the context for what happens there. Something similar could be done with NPCs or objects: they could be assigned a particular location and when they are present in your location, their history with you will affect the context at that location. 

You could also generate scene descriptions, NPC actions, and objects in the room using prompts specialized for each, rather than one prompt generating everything. 

In my version of the game I modified it so that it randomly puts ""you try to"" before some of the actions you type, so that sometimes what you try will fail. That's okay, but really it should depend on how difficult an action is to achieve. I've been hitting my head on doorframes a lot ""trying to"" exit rooms.

2019-12-31-224503,,"The epic conclusion to my ~3 hour adventure as a squire sent to defeat the evil ""Great Lich Lord""","You look up and notice the Great Lich Lord sitting on a throne made out of pure black ice. He smiles at you and says ""Welcome to my castle, mortal. Come closer if you wish to live.

***&gt; Go closer to the lich lord***

You approach the lich lord cautiously. As you near he begins to speak ""Hello, human. I am pleased to see that you have chosen to visit me rather than your usual haunts such as the sewers or the mines.""  

""What do you want from me?""

***&gt; “I have come to defeat you”***

The lich lord laughs ""Very well then, let us try something fun. What would be more entertaining than two mortals fighting each other?""  

You reply ""A very good question! A battle between two wizards!""

***&gt; Cast an ice bolt spell at the lich lord***

You raise your hands in preparation to unleash your icy blast but before you can, the lich lord casts another spell. This one freezes time itself around you. You feel frozen solid and unable to move.

***&gt; You freeze up unable to move***

You feel like you are being slowly crushed underfoot. Your heart sinks when you realize that this will probably kill you. You attempt to struggle free but the lich lord simply raises his hand and thaws you out again.  ""Hah! That was easy!""

***&gt; Bow before the lich lord and say “you are too powerful for me”***

You bow before the lich lord and say ""You are too powerful for me, mortal!""  

He chuckles ""Yes, yes I know. Let us try something else. How about we play a game?""

***&gt; Ask the lich lord “what game shall we play?”***

You ask the lich lord ""What game shall we play?""  

He replies ""Hmm... Hmm... Oh yes, I remember now. We should play a game of chess. It's much easier than playing against humans, right?""

***&gt; Reply to the lich lord “Ok, lets play chess!”***

You reply to the lich lord ""OK, lets play chess!""  The lich lord picks up a piece and looks at it carefully. You think you've seen him looking at pieces before but you're not sure what they were called.

***&gt; Begin to play chess with the lich lord***

You begin to play chess with the lich lord. The lich lord is clearly better than you so you give up quickly. After a few turns he wins and you lose all hope of defeating him.

***&gt; You say to the lich lord “you have bested me in muscle and wit, I cannot defeat you...”***

You say to the lich lord ""You have bested me in muscle and wit, I cannot defeat you...""  

The lich lord smiles ""Ha ha, no you haven't. But don't worry, you'll never beat me in magic either.""

***&gt; Smile and say to the lich lord “how about a game of Rock Paper Scissors?”***

You smile and say to the lich lord ""How about a game of Rock Paper Scissors?""  

The lich lord says ""Sure, why not?"" He tosses a rock at you. You catch it and throw it back at him. He catches it and throws it back at you.

***&gt; You throw a piece of paper at the lich lord***

You throw a piece of paper at the lich lord. He catches it and stares at it for awhile then tosses it back to you. You catch it and look at the paper. It reads:  Rock Paper Scissor  You win! You are an amazing wizard!

***&gt; You say to the lich lord “I won!? Does that mean I am the best wizard?”***

You say to the lich lord ""I won!? Does that mean I am the best wizard?""  

The lich lord laughs ""No, silly mortal. You are just lucky. I'm afraid you can't be my equal in any way.""

***&gt; Respond the lich lord “how about another game? If I win you will give me your powers!”***

You respond the lich lord ""How about another game? If I win you will give me your powers!""  

The lich lord tosses a rock at you. You catch it and throw it back at him. He catches it and stares at it for awhile then tosses it back to you.

***&gt; You toss a piece of paper at the lich lord***

You toss a piece of paper at the lich lord. He catches it and stares at it for awhile then tosses it back to you. You catch it and look at the paper. It reads: Rock Paper Scissor  You win! You are an amazing wizard!

***&gt; Tell the lich lord “I won again! Now give me your powers!”***

You tell the lich lord ""I won again! Now give me your powers!""  The lich lord grabs you by the hand and pulls you into his throne room.

***&gt; Follow the lich lord into his throne room and receive his powers***

You follow the lich lord into his throne room. He sits down on a chair in front of a large table filled with books. You sit down next to him and he looks around the room as if searching for something.

***&gt; Ask the lich lord what he is searching for***

You ask the lich lord ""What are you looking for?""

***&gt; Watch as the lich lords grabs a magic orb***

You watch as the lich lord grabs a magic orb from one of the books on the table. The book has several pages torn out but you don't notice because they are all covered with arcane symbols. The lich lord holds up the page and begins chanting in some strange language.

***&gt; Listen to the lich lord***

You listen to the lich lord ""This is not how it should be done. This is not how we do things here in this castle.""  

He turns around and walks away from the table leaving you alone with him. You feel like you have been tricked...""

***&gt; Stand up and ask the lich lord “I won fairly so give me your powers!”***

You stand up and yell ""Give me your powers! Give me your power!""  

The lich lord stands there staring at you. He doesn't move or even turn around. He just continues to stare at you.

***&gt; Grab the lich lord by his throat and absorb his powers***

You grab the lich lord's neck and begin absorbing his powers. You feel your body grow warm and tingly. Your mind starts to become clearer and more focused. Suddenly you hear a voice that sounds very familiar, ""Oh my, you've grown strong! You're stronger than ever before!""

***&gt; Take your knife and stab the lich lord in the eyes***

You slice your knife across the lich lord's eyes causing him to fall backwards off the chair. He screams and falls over onto his ass. You laugh and continue eating until you finish him off.

***&gt; Your body grows stronger and you become young again***

Your body becomes stronger and you become young again.

***&gt; The gods praise you for defeating the lich lord. You win!***

You feel great joy and victory fills you. You smile and walk back towards the door where the lich lord was standing. He stares at you blankly as if he can't believe that you defeated him.

***&gt; Laugh and say to the dying lich lord “Now who is the best wizard!”***

You laugh and say to the lich lord ""Now who is the best wizard?""  

The lich lord looks down at himself and smiles, then he dies.",,,,[],False,False,BasicMyth,1421561903,,,[],,,,text,t2_ks7ta,False,False,[],True,False,,,False,1577828703,,,self.AIDungeon,False,0,False,ei9btf,True,False,False,False,True,True,False,,adventure,[],Adventure,dark,text,False,,False,False,5,0,False,,/r/AIDungeon/comments/ei9btf/the_epic_conclusion_to_my_3_hour_adventure_as_a/,False,,False,,,,1586940835,18,,True,False,False,AIDungeon,t5_29uaei,r/AIDungeon,15420,public,,self,,,0,[],https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/ei9btf/the_epic_conclusion_to_my_3_hour_adventure_as_a/,,
