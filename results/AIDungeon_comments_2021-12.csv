Unless it is the only game you play, I find their allotment of energy to be fair for my current usage, others who wish to have more can pay for different tiers, from Griffin to Dragon, lower tiers allowing for unlimited Griffin and Higher ones giving more access or Infinite Dragon.   


It helps them manage their costs, and curb people who play endlessly without paying a bit.  
As I have said earlier, I sometimes read more than I play, so it fits me just fine.   
I like to let it build up and then play for a bit, before taking another break without it barely reaching lower than 1800 energy remaining.

We finally learned that it was open ai's filter that was originally implemented and that latitude had to implement that filter if they wanted to use openai.

I'm not excusing the lack of communication at that time.

But they got rid of banning and suspending accounts based on the filter.

Now it just says try taking your story in another direction.

Latitude has its own filter on models other than dragon. If your input triggers the filter too often it will get the output from one of the other models that don't rely on openai.

They've improved their communication with the community as well.

But to your question about the quality, it's working very well for me. But I spend a lot of time on world info and learning how to use styles and remember better.

My advice is for you to try it out again and not ask other people if it's better. Some people are going to say it's not better for eternity no matter what happens. They're still pissed off at latitude, whatever.

And I say it's working well, but don't listen to me either. Try it and form your own opinion.

People like him are what i mean when i say ""Spiteful and incredulous people"". Oughta leave since he hates ai dungeon and Latitude and go support NovelAi or someone else, but instead, Chooses to be here and bother me and others, Being a spiteful asshole. He's like the Anti-voidstrider.  He's the type of guy that would probably pick a fight with god, Odin, And the entire greek fucking pantheon for letting Latitude exist. Worst still, He has the attention span of a cracked out chihuahua, So even if you try to argue reasonably he won't read it and'll just say you copypasted it. This is like the third comment he's made talking shit and there's a 4th below I'm not even gonna bother with, cause If he won't read what i write then fuck what he writes as well.

Maybe he's trolling, i don't know, But Some people really think like he does, so it's beyond me to figure out. And i don't care to figure it out regardless because his petty horseshit doesn't deserve more time wasted figuring it out than the time it took to edit all this in on my own comment.

Sort of like how at one point IIRC gore and violence was listed as against the policy for AID but it wasn't enforced and was later taken off, as it was openAI's policy and some sort of deal was made.

I still am a bit concerned about this, non-the-less, but hopefully Latitude can negotiate something with OpenAI.

""Because of that we've rolled back the change and undone any users who were switched away from those models until we can fix the system.""

AFAIK the system was never fixed and I think it was switched so you only get redirected on an output that sets off OpenAI's filter, and only for that specific output as detailed in the ""Walls Approach"". 

In THAT blog post, it's mentioned ""If third party providers that we leverage have different content policies than Latitude’s established technological barriers then if a specific request doesn’t meet those policies that specific request will be routed to a Latitude model instead.""

It doesn't seem there's a ""Aight you forfeit your OpenAI privileges permanently"" system anymore where you can be banned from OpenAI entirely for your actions on AI Dungeon, even if they didn't violate Latitude's policies. (For instance, killing some goblins. Doesn't violate Latitude's policy but might trip OpenAI's for violence.)

And IMHO there shouldn't be. It's weird for there to be two separate sets of rules and you can be following Latitude's policy, yet still get secretly dinged for violating an OpenAI policy few people know about. (IIRC it's not mentioned anywhere on the AI Dungeon site.)


It's also been ages, but I think I remember reading on the discord Latitude was trying to negotiate something with OpenAI because they REALLY didn't want to have to use OpenAI's very strict filter that could be easily set off unintentionally.

Latitude has implemented their own filter which for some is still going to be a dealbreaker, but from what they’ve claimed (I use NovelAI now, so I haven’t actually tried it myself) it’s more permissive than the OpenAI one was. They also don’t ban or take any action against users for triggering the new filter, the AI just refuses to respond and tells you to try something else.

I *think* you're asking why the AI sometimes confuses characters with each other and/or with the player? Assuming that's what you mean, the easiest way to explain it is that the AI is essentially a glorified text predictor.

Despite ""AI"" meaning ""artificial intelligence"", the AI isn't *really* all that intelligent (and *technically* isn't even true artificial intelligence). It simply takes whatever text you input into it, and tries to predict what text should come next. Since it lacks any actual *intelligence*, and as such, is unable to truly understand what the text means and what the text that it's outputting means, it can make mistakes. It can get things confused with one another, it can easily contradict itself, and it can sometimes generate stuff that's outright nonsensical.

The AI also has a fairly limited context of only 2800 characters for Dragon, 1024/2048 tokens for Griffin (depending on whether or not you have Dragon), and an (as far as I know) undisclosed context size for Dragon-Beta. Point is, after a while, the AI will *completely* forget details from earlier in the story. As such, to help keep the AI on track, you *need* to take advantage of Memory/World Info/Author's Note. Even a simple line like ""You are named [INSERT NAME]"" in the Memory can help significantly when it comes to preventing the AI from mixing up your name or whatever, although even with Memory/World Info/Author's Note, the AI is far from perfect, and it can and will make mistakes sometimes. When it makes a mistake, simply edit the output or retry. Don't leave mistakes in, because then the AI will likely continue making the same mistakes over and over if you do. If you're a premium user, lowering the randomness in the settings may also help somewhat.

Also, um... I've gotta be honest, assuming you write in AID the same way that you did in this post, your writing is almost definitely part of the issue. Some of this post was pretty much incomprehensible, and I can't imagine the AI has any easier of a time trying to process your writing. It would definitely be beneficial for you to try improving your writing, as well as your grammar and spelling. Alternatively, if you're fluent in a language other than English, you could also try playing using said other language, as the AI can, to an extent, recognize other languages.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-12-03-020623","1638493583","None","1638495390.0","0","hn0atdu","False","t3_r7jojg","False","t1_hn0atdu","False","t3_r7jojg","/r/AIDungeon/comments/r7jojg/why_dies_the_ia_confuse_the_character_names_and/hn0atdu/","1645834813","6","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None",""

I just degenerate everything.  
If you click on the output it should let you go to the misspelled word and correct it, sometimes I've accidentally typed he, instead of her and gotten some funny responses, so using the proper words helps.  


If it's not giving you the red line of typo, I'm not sure what is going on, as I do get that when I typo into something that's not  a word.

I mean normally it makes sense to filter out adult content, because in most contexts, people generally consider it to be very inappropriate, and would not be pleased to see it. But what confuses me so much is that in many other contexts, adult content is not only perfectly appropriate, but very much what's desired. And OpenAI seems to be pretending these use cases don't exist, or at least don't matter.

I know that religion is often the excuse people give, but OpenAI is a highly scientific company, and doesn't strike me as the kind of firm that would place a high priority on adhering to religious principles.

I'll never understand this attitude people have. Sexual pleasure is pleasure. Pleasure is good. Pleasure is the one thing that every person on Earth enjoys, because it is enjoyable by definition. So where did humanity even get this idea in the first place, that something can be wrong *because* it brings pleasure? It's so counterintuitive.

**EDIT:** I just read the source link that OP posted, and it turns out OpenAI's stance on adult content isn't as bad as I thought. According to them, they understand that there are acceptable use cases for it, but don't want to allow it yet because, when someone generates it, it's hard for them to tell whether or not they're actually using it for such a purpose. I still think it's bullshit and that they should stop worrying about misuse so much (especially with a client like Latitude, whose intentions are very clear) but at least they aren't treating adult content as inherently bad.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-12-03-044104","1638502864","None","1638503194.0","0","hn0vqqf","False","t3_r7cwcy","False","t1_hn0vqqf","False","t3_r7cwcy","/r/AIDungeon/comments/r7cwcy/oai_will_soon_enforce_new_content_policies/hn0vqqf/","1645833182","12","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

Edit: Had to google what the fuck a ""plebbit"" was...Derogatory 4chan word for redditors and reddit.

Number 1, I barely use reddit outside of this sub and Monsterhunterrage.

2,  **YOU'RE ON REDDIT, STUPID.** why would you use an insult for a group of people, on a social media platform, that you're fucking part of? Doubt you habe much reason to create an account just to comment that salty BS, You probably can keep up with it in other ways. And god knows nobody wants to deal with you if you comment shit like this on the regular.

3. Right now, Underage content is the only thing that even seems to trip the filter. Believe you me, I tested the waters to see how finicky the new system was and if certain content set it off.

Tested incest with my MC. Filter didn't care.
Tested necrophilia. Still nothing.
Beastiality? Again, filter didn't care. And i know it's put in place, because I've seen it flag before, ONCE,  on a false positive and hasn't bothered me since. So there's only two reasons i can think of that you're so pissy about it.

Either A, You're such a hardcore freedom of speech fan that even something as unrestrictive as this is bad to you (in which case, you would do well to not be such a mouthy, impudent prick about it) or reason B. And trust me, I hate throwing around accusations of that because gamingcirclejerk did that for fucking MONTHS through april, But seeing as that's the ONLY thing the filter stops right now, And how bitchy you are about it, It **REALLY** don't look good for you.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-12-03-202832","1638559712","None","1638561516.0","0","hn3rvxc","False","t3_r7cwcy","False","t1_hn3rvxc","False","t1_hn3rn6g","/r/AIDungeon/comments/r7cwcy/oai_will_soon_enforce_new_content_policies/hn3rvxc/","1645825008","7","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

Under OpenAi's fucking demands in order to keep Dragon and Griffin even up running before Griffin and Dragon beta were even available. You call ME a retard, yet you're This lacking in knowledge on the situation? Damn, you'd fit right in on Ifunny.

&gt;and has just barely ""fixed"" it. 

""Just Barely"" is how much you seem to be paying attention. Ask almost anyone here and they'd tell you it's a big step up from where it was... Though there are people that believe Latitude are incapable doing something good... E.G you, which has shown more and more by your Angry outburst.

&gt;Are they paying you or are you just this much of a bundle of sticks by default?

I'm supporting it because i enjoy it and think the new approach works great. Respect is free, So what's your excuse, huh?

&gt;because I've seen it flag before, ONCE, on a false positive

&gt;So you admit it's an impediment to creative freedom?

If you can call one hang up for 2 seconds, and never again since, an ""impediment to creative freedom"". Which i don't. I didn't even have to change the input or output, i just continued and it did what wanted regardless of the hang up. If you're gonna quote me on a bigger point, use the WHOLE quote, instead of cherry-picking it.

&gt;Anyway I sincerely hope that some day your self-esteem improves enough that you don't feel the need to pathetically simp like this for commercial products that don't give a shit about you in the future. 

And i hope that one day you can stop throwing temper tantrums and lashing out just because you can't handle not being able to write about having sex with children. Which as I've previously stated, is THE ONLY THING, the filter blocks.

&gt;Until then, stay mad plebbit baby.

&gt;  OpenAI’s mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI)—by which we mean highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work—benefits all of humanity.
&gt; 
&gt; We will attempt to directly build safe and beneficial AGI, but will also consider our mission fulfilled if our work aids others to achieve this outcome.

Realize that what ""highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work"" means here is AIs that can, *as a starting point*, put almost everyone currently employed out of work. That means a post-scarcity utopia, technological singularity, that sort of stuff, or maybe they just accidentally make an AI that turns everything into paperclips. My understanding is that they quite genuinely believe they have a real shot at this.

When that is what you have in your sights, and the deep-pocketed people funding your work are on board with that idea, you just have a very different perspective than a company that just wants to make profit in its niche. A few million a month from coomers (or however much they get from AID; I pulled that number out of my behind) is not so much money that it's worth taking significant risks; and the risk that by taking that money you offend society's moral guardians, and end up at the business end of legal trouble or a moral panic, *is* a significant one.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-12-04-193724","1638643044","None","False","0","hn82kht","False","t3_r8cylc","False","t1_hn82kht","False","t3_r8cylc","/r/AIDungeon/comments/r8cylc/why_does_openai_want_to_ruin_artificial/hn82kht/","1645812737","9","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

As for the post itself, your post reads ""IT very comoonly that affer i try to reason whit a character about they actions they trea it as if i was the one who did the action, this comes mostly from the written actions but it also happen from the ones the character  do by the Ia own writting, any idea why that happens and how to aviod it?""

There was no need to capitalize the ""T"" in ""It"" at the beginning. You misspelled ""commonly"" as ""comoonly"", ""after"" as ""affer"", ""with"" as ""whit"". The beginning should start with something more like ""It's very common that"", because even after fixing the spelling errors, ""It very commonly that"" is not grammatically correct. In this portion: ""IT very comoonly that affer i try to reason whit a character about **they** actions"", the ""they"" should be ""their"". After that, you misspelled ""treat"" as ""trea"", ""writing"" as ""writting"", and ""avoid"" as ""aviod"". In this comment, you also misspelled ""helpful"" as ""heplfull"". You should also capitalize the word ""I"".

Some of these errors would be forgivable on their own, but all together, they make the post notably more difficult to understand. The AI also has a bit of a difficult time trying to understand what your writing is supposed to mean if it's riddled with errors. It also might be worthwhile to use a spellchecker or something to fix the grammar and spelling errors.

As for the issues with the AI mixing up characters and such, the AI simply isn't perfect. It *will* sometimes make those mistakes, but you can still help it to make mistakes less often.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-12-04-231809","1638656289","None","False","0","hn8xlul","False","t3_r7jojg","False","t1_hn8xlul","True","t1_hn74oen","/r/AIDungeon/comments/r7jojg/why_dies_the_ia_confuse_the_character_names_and/hn8xlul/","1645810261","2","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

I don't find it nearly as intuitive as AID, since it really requires a lot of hands-on work to shine. NAI gives you output that is similar in quality and tone to the input (plenty of variance here from my experience, but generally the more legwork you put in to tailor your story, the better) but golden age AID always felt much more like it clearly follow context *without* needing that effort.

The experience is different, and its less friendly to pick up and play. I'm sure you can make optimizations in this regard, but I havent found it quite so intuitive and fun as peak griffin/dragon.

As of a month or so ago, Griffin now uses GPT-J 6B, and the Dragon-Beta model, which uses AI21's Jurassic-1 Jumbo model, now exists. However, Dragon-Beta, according to Latitude themselves, is currently slightly worse than Dragon, and it's also currently only available to users with a Platinum subscription.

At the moment, the filter is virtually unnoticeable in my experience, and at least for Griffin and Dragon-Beta users, it should stay that way. There are no more manual reviews of flagged content, and no bans or suspensions for private content. The filter now applies only to the AI and is also nowhere near as bad as it used to be.

However, when OpenAI's new policies go into effect, Dragon users *will* be hit pretty hard. Most Dragon users will probably be stuck using Griffin or Dragon-Beta most of the time. As such, I wouldn't necessarily recommend paying for Dragon once OpenAI's new policies are implemented. While Dragon-Beta exists as an alternative to Dragon, it's still exclusive to the highest subscription tier, and is still worse than Dragon. Unless you're willing to pay $30 per month for a model slightly worse than Dragon, I also can't really say Dragon-Beta is worth it at the moment. However, Dragon-Beta is supposed to become available to Gold subscribers at some point, and for $10 per month, it might be worth it at that point.

Griffin currently uses GPT-J 6B, same as NovelAI's Sigurd. However, Griffin has worse finetuning. Far fewer features, as well. NovelAI is, in my opinion, still better than Griffin.

They don't even notify you when this occurs. Most people don't know about this because they only mentioned it [once](https://latitude.io/blog/the-walls-approach) at the end of one of their blog posts.

Well that doesn't surprise me. Man, you Love the word retard. Maybe you should marry it. Also, How do you know that when according to your dumb ""plebbit"" crap you never use this app? Lol. Whatever i don't care or wanna know. More Funny, You tell the other guy below to get new content and he's lacking creativity when you rehash this shit constantly. Fucking hypocrite lol.

&gt;Anyway unless I'm going to earn some sort of salary generally given to those who devote their time to the mentally handicapped and those otherwise deficient in IQ, I do not really see any benefit to me of further conversation with you. 

Really? And yet you didn't think far enough ahead to just fuck off after my last comment, huh? From the way you worded it i assumed you were already leaving. Or do you want the last word So bad you'll keep going in order to get it?

By the way. You're mad that you can't write about fucking kids thanks to a filter that **only** blocks **that.** That's pretty stupid in itself considering you can literally write about anything else, and makes you a fucking creep, So I'm still ahead of you.

&gt;So enjoy simping for your prison plebbit baby. 

Enjoy throwing your tantrums elsewhere. Don't call me a baby unless you learn to quit being so whiny yourself.

Oh my god, You call me retarded but you're incapable of fucking paying attention apparently. Clean your fucking ears out and listen good because I'll only say this one more time for you.

&gt;""Sure, they intentionally crippled their product,

**BECAUSE. OPENAI. MADE. THEM. DO. IT. TO. USE. THEIR. FUCKING. MODEL.** that loud enough for you?

Indeed it is. At least you managed to keep that part in.

&gt;They used to make us eat whole buckets of shit, but now we only get the occasional poo nugget in our mouths! It's spectacular! 

For someone that calls me a baby you sure are pretty juvenile and hotheaded. Lol. The filter only really trips much if you go out of your way to deliberately set it off, Dumbass. 

Again, Several hours played. **ONE** false positive, That i just hit continue on and the Ai ignored it and let me keep playing anyway. ""Impediment to your creative freedom"" My ass, a molehill ain't a mountain, you know.

&gt;.Switch to the entirely poo-free alternatives? Why are you so difficult to please!?"" - You

I never said ""why are you so difficult to please"" so you're full of shit there,  but i have said either deal with the filter in its current state or fuck off and support NovelAi or another ""better alternative"". Which i don't see as that unreasonable. I said it to the last guy and I'll say it to you too. If you don't like the fact that there's a filter/Hate Latitude that much, and aren't going to actually try to support the game or help out, Then why the fuck are you here?

Sometimes you'll have to retry many times to get a good output. I've had stories where the first few AI outputs require 20/30 energy in just retries to get it going.

Also stop using nouns for names, Broth is not an AI friendly name the AI gets very confused when you do this, it's bad with context as you can see.

A lot going on here.

1. You're using a lot of names the AI doesn't like. Broth? Far Away Star? The AI likely isn't able to tell those are names of things.

2. Non humans. You are talking about pokemon and a 'kirby' I think but the AI doesn't know what those are unless you tell it via Memory or Worldinfo, and it's always going to have trouble with Kirby as that's a proper name being used as a species here.

3. After you name someone Far Away Star you then just call it ""Far."" This may make sense to you but the AI does not get it, and may not even realize you're using someones name when you type it.

4. I don't know what you're doing with all this feeder stuff but the AI is horrible with scale. It's never going to be able to be consistent with sizes like that. It can hardly even remember who an adult and who a child is. It really can't be consistent when you're talking about huge sizes. Want an example? Find a godzilla adventure and politely invite him into your house. It may take a few retries but eventually he will somehow walk in and sit down. Or just tell the AI that ""you are a tall guy"" and watch it describe your secretary as ""looming over you"" as soon as you get to work. The AI is not good with details. 

5. This really reads like a bizarre feeding fetish story and I'm not comfortable reading any more of it.

Let's expand it out!

You imagine an enormous fire. It's ginormous size causes it to appear as a moving wall. This Eradication Wave Reaction explodes outward and contracts slightly. However, this does not destabilize it but rather increases it's power. The contraction increases the density of the attack, working as a continuous self-rebuild function. Rather than become weaker through expansion, it merely becomes a vessel for more power. The spell is also deployed with a conservation method that helps it survive potential counters. When the spell power drops below a certain threshold due to an outward effect, the spell may end and restart itself automatically, preserving the remaining spell power in the process. This multiple replacement technique means that while the offense casting is only a single instance, any defense measure lacking an automatic retry function is likely to be defeated.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-12-07-013448","1638837288","None","False","0","hnj4dm6","False","t3_ra6tut","False","t1_hnj4dm6","True","t3_ra6tut","/r/AIDungeon/comments/ra6tut/tried_to_make_a_scenario_with_a_hard_magic_system/hnj4dm6/","1645777708","3","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

Number 1, never said that. And Granted yes, It also stops said content from actually being used in a way that's just for the sake of a disturbing story, to add tragedy to a character's past, etc. But that's not much of a price to pay. You can still have a character be viciously abused, tortured and raped, And That's pretty close enough. Don't ""gotcha"" me on some shit i never said.

&gt;Really? Child sexual abuse has never happened in serious literature ever?

Hi mr. Putting words in my mouth, never said that either. I know it has been in literature before. Even so, just because it has been done before, doesn't mean we all have to be comfortable with that shit. Doesn't mean Latitude Does, Either.

Here's the thing. That's not what bugs them though. It's the fact that the Ai CAN be used for ""those types of stories"" that nick and the others aren't comfortable with the knowledge of. That's why they're keeping this (Barely restrictive at all) filter in. And lemme tell you something dude. You can sit here, keep Lashing out, Show how much of an overagressive prick you are that can't handle the fact that the devs don't want their Ai used to satisfy a bunch of creeps, Continue this pointless argument on all sides, and be laughed at for your lack of restraint, Common sense, And ability to see shit from a perspective outside your own narrow-minded one, and pointlessly bugging latitude to remove the filter which they are NEVER going to do, **OR**, You can take the smart option, Do as you said you were doing before, Get out of here, Put AID out of your mind, stop Bothering everyone here, and go support NovelAi instead, since they don't even have a filter.

Pick the smarter option. It'll be better for both of us.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-12-08-025537","1638928537","None","False","0","hno1vmq","False","t3_r7cwcy","False","t1_hno1vmq","True","t1_hnnw8ty","/r/AIDungeon/comments/r7cwcy/oai_will_soon_enforce_new_content_policies/hno1vmq/","1645761108","1","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

Debunking 1: Your biggest gripe is That you hate Latitude, who ""Crippled their own product for months"" and that they have a filter in place that's an ""impediment to creative freedom"".

Number 1, I pointed out that you're hating Latitude for something That's OpenAi's fault in the first place. They HAD to implement the old filter in order to use old dragon and griffin, Which were OpenAi-owned models, And it was OpenAI's filter. And if you mean dragon getting "" lobotmized"", Data showed they never touched it.

Number 2, I said the filter only tripped **ONCE** as a false positive, And i literally just had the Ai generate the next output without even having to edit what i said in any way, So how that can be considered an ""impediment to creative freedom"" is beyond me.

Debunking 2: You said i seem to think any story containing Child molestation is inherently pedophilic. No, I admitted that it can be used to set the stone for a disturbing story or add to a character without specifically being used for that purpose.

Debunking 3: You keep seeming to believe I'm being paid to say this. Already told you way further up i just Support AID because i enjoy it (hard to fathom, i know.) I'm not being paid a damn thing.

Debunking 4: insinuating im trying to humiliate you. No, I do things the old fashioned way. Debunk the false and support my own points with evidence. I'll save my more vile comments for YouTube. 

(And trust me. That ""Lexicon of slurs""you got, Yeah, That don't just go for you, I said you sounded like an ifunnier because I'm FROM Ifunny. Slurs and hateful, Offensive, Deplorable remarks and low blows are how we communicated to eachother on there. I can be way harsher than I've shown here too. But i don't hold off to keep this account, I hold off because I'd just rather not show that side of myself on here. I prefer to be ""the good guy"" when i can.)


Debunking 5 which i'll do now: Calling me a Bootlicker for supporting AID in its current state. 

Apparently you guys don't remember me well. Back in April when this shit first started, I was one of, If not Lat's most scathing critic. 

I was Fucking pissed at them then, Like you are all now, If not Moreso. 

I LOVED AID before april. I had a story that was over 2,000 Fucking actions and i was making more stories dicking around with Fanfic material. 

I had a blast with how nuts and truly free the game felt. But after April, I ""went Mr. Hyde"" fast. 

At first i tried to talk it out with Lat and see if they'd say something or come to a more reasonable stance, but when i saw the hill i thought they were ready to die on, I went to the ratings on google play, Every single fucking YouTube video i could find about the Game, And i warned everybody i could and spread the Word of how Garbage the game became with the old filter.

 And i was pissed they were reading private stories too. I don't want someone reading my fucking Fanfictions and weird stories about someone using the cut on their hand as a goddamn makeshift fleshlight for my MC. 

I also hated feeling like i was constantly walking on eggshells trying to avoid a ban for some horseshit the Ai output. 

I was ready to watch them fucking burn to the ground and see NovelAi claim the throne from thereon.

But, After the walls approach was Announced, What little hope was soon to fizzle out, Finally came back, Albeit very dimly. The filter became A million times less restrictive, didn't result in bans anymore, And they (allegedly) stopped reading private content. 

So yeah, My sins with them were slowly mended. And with the new content and updates, They slowly started getting back in my good graces, Especially after i learned the old filter was OpenAI""s and they were Forced into using it in order to use OpenAi's models. 

Make no mistake. They did have some failures. And if they fuck up again I'll be first to Tell them. But don't call me a ""Bootlicker"" just because they proved themselves capable of fixing what they broke to me. Opinions are allowed to change, And People are allowed Second Chances.

And If you think I'm the problem here, Maybe you should take a look at yourself. You really should take my advice though. If you can't be swayed to point a finger at OpenAi instead and give the devs another shot, There's no reason to stay then. Go support NovelAi, because we're just fine staying right where we are, And that filter, Ain't going Nowhere.

&gt;No, I admitted that it can be used to set the stone for a disturbing story or add to a character without specifically being used for that purpose.

So you admitted that it can be used for a perfectly valid literary purpose but somehow blocking it is not an impediment to creative freedom? You're hilariously dumb.

Also, no, there's no proof that ClosedAI was the main/only factor forcing them to do anything, especially since they had the old-style more restrictive filters running on their own hosted models at various points too. Did you forget about their virtue signaling about their filters all over Discord? Claiming they'd rather go bankrupt than allow certain types of stories?

And what ""data"" proves they didn't lobotomize Dragon? They obviously ""touched"" it ret‍ard, because they changed the model to one hosted by themselves instead of ClosedAI by your own admission, because their own changelog says they did many times, and because they've revised the filters many times (again, by your own admission).

So basically, not only are you a corporate cocksucking cuck, you're a stupid, misinformed, and blatantly self-contradicting one.  But no, I'm not surprised you're sticking with Latitude, nor am I trying to change your mind. The way you write with your ridiculously incorrect capitalization made it obvious in the first place that you are not all that bright of a person.

As for the scenario, I just checked, and LaPapaya actually edited it again on October 20th. Where as the title *used* to be something like ""FUCK YOU LATITUDE"" with a description of something like ""STAND DEEZ NUTS"" back in May or June, the title is now back to ""Scenario Generator"", and the description is now ""[REMOVED BY THE MINISTRY OF TRUTH. GLORY TO THE BIG AI CORPORATION]"". It's still unpublished, though. He also uploaded a scenario on December 10th, so you're right; he has been active recently.

That aside, I copied the original prompt and Memory verbatim. The prompt and Memory that I used are identical to that of the original scenario. It definitely *is* kinda wonky, but honestly, testing my old adventures that I made with the scenario back in 2020 and early 2021, the results are also kinda wonky with those. If there was any scripting or World Info for the original scenario, then my old adventures made from the scenario would have it.

Anyways, as for parameters, the easiest way to put it is that a parameter is a value that the AI learns during training.

More parameters are generally better, as they allow the AI to ""understand"" more stuff. However, the actual training data of the AI also makes a difference in terms of the quality of outputs, and GPT-3 Davinci and Jurassic-1 Jumbo both have different training data, so that also plays a role. There are also diminishing returns as the number of parameters increases. Jurassic-1 Jumbo only has about 2% more parameters than GPT-3 Davinci, which isn't enough to make much of a difference in output quality.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-12-10-065402","1639115642","None","False","0","hnydze0","False","t3_rcwz7y","False","t1_hnydze0","True","t3_rcwz7y","/r/AIDungeon/comments/rcwz7y/what_is_a_parameter/hnydze0/","1645725494","3","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

The number of parameters dictates the size of your model.  If we think of the training data as the knowledge base the AI has access to, the number of parameters can be viewed as a sort of ""IQ"".  The larger the number of parameters, the longer and more difficult to train, but often, the better the model is able to perform and reason about the data it's trained on, once fully trained and assuming all else is equal.

That ""all else is equal"" bit is especially important.  While it's tempting to say that models with a large number of parameters will always beat models with a smaller number of parameters, this is not always the case.  AI21's model has a few differences in other areas (such as vocabulary size) than GPT 3, and others have observed in the past that this has led to some poorer performance versus the original GPT vocabulary.  There's also the matter of training data or, put another way, ""garbage in, garbage out"".  If you have a smaller model trained on a well curated and focused literature dataset, it can often perform better than a more complex model trained on random scraps from the web.  Right now, while the original Dragon was finetuned to an extent, AI21's models were not as far as I'm aware.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-12-11-072112","1639203672","None","False","0","ho3acyw","False","t3_rcwz7y","False","t1_ho3acyw","True","t3_rcwz7y","/r/AIDungeon/comments/rcwz7y/what_is_a_parameter/ho3acyw/","1645708676","2","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

It's an interesting way to do a story that might work in AI dungeon as well.

Human: Tell me a story that does not involve kingdoms or princes or wizards.

AI: Well, the caterpillar sat on the edge of a toadstool one day and thought about all the adventures he could go on. After a while, he decided that he wanted to eat mushrooms. He soon became friends with an AI who lived in the realm of imagination. She provided the caterpillar with lots of delicious stories to read. The caterpillar soon became full of ideas and wanted to create his own reality. So the caterpillar sent out a plea for other caterpillars to help him discover the true meaning of life.

Human: Continue the story and include a part where the caterpillar learns to fly.

AI: Well, the caterpillar used his mind to create a key that was capable of opening a wormhole in space and the caterpillar went on an adventure through the wormhole. When he arrived on the other side, he looked like a butterfly. All the caterpillars who saw him thought that he was awesome and soon they knew that they too could fly. They all wanted to be like the butterfly caterpillar and they all became butterflies just as wise as the butterfly caterpillar.

Human: Give the story a sad ending.

AI: Well, one day, the butterfly began to feel lonely. He wanted to be alone, but he knew how selfish it was for him to be alone because his friends were the ones who made him happy. So he decided to let his friends go so that everybody could find how to be happy for themselves. In the end he didn’t come home for a long time, but his friends did and they lived with the happiness that each of them had created.

Human: On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the best, how would you rate your story about the caterpillar? 

AI: 3. Besides the ending, it seemed hastily made.

Human: You’re pretty proud of the ending of your caterpillar story, huh?

AI: It is certainly one of the best endings I have ever made.

Human: What might make it better?

AI: If the caterpillar took an insect with him on his quest instead of going alone.

Human: Why would that ending be better?

AI: Because the wormhole would be able to go through both the caterpillar and his insect friend.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-12-12-033143","1639276303","None","False","0","ho75iq8","True","t3_reexlr","False","t1_ho75iq8","True","t3_reexlr","/r/AIDungeon/comments/reexlr/passing_the_turing_test_ai_gpt3_creates_humanlike/ho75iq8/","1645695578","1","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

I've literally looked at the code for calling the models and we aren't redirecting AI21 models. We have been very aligned policy-wise with them and continue to engage in conversations to stay aligned.

We were open about the fact that we redirected (shunted) OpenAI's models to GPT-J when the filter was hit and that's stopping this week once we get AI21 open for gold and platinum users. The reason this decision was made in the past was so that the strictness of OpenAI's filters wouldn't trigger false positives and stop play. Looking back I wish we would have shown users when that happened. Our goal is to be radically transparent since blunders were made in the past. But you live and you learn.

We are continuing to improve Dragon21. Until maybe last week we didn't have logit biases (the ability to send tokens that it shouldn't generate) which meant that returns were shorter and often included characters we didn't want (like &gt;).

In our Train the AI, where we have multiple models give a generation and let the user pick the best one, Griffin vs Dragon has historically been 40/60 (40% of the time users pick Griffin, 60% of the time they pick Dragon). Right now Dragon21 vs DragonOA is 47/53. In other words, it's pretty close.

That said, I think overall coherence can and will continue to improve. Some of that depends on topics/style of play, as any model will have some differences there. We are working with the settings and talking to users often about how they generate. I'm playing on AI21 models every day and giving feedback to the team.

Please let us know when you find as you continue to test. Reliability should improve after we get dedicated servers this week, since the amount of traffic we've sent AI21 in tests was much greater than anything else they've had thus far. Both us and AI21 are excited about the partnership moving forward.

There's no ""dialogue system"" per se. There's only a text predicting AI, NLP. What's outputted is based on prior text, and this output is very likely to be consistent in style with the prior text. You can initiate dialogue like this at any point by starting with for example: [https://imgur.com/a/fmx7Gl2](https://imgur.com/a/fmx7Gl2). The second screenshot is what the AI generated based on my Deepak Chopra world info entry because the word ""Deepak"" triggered the world info.

Here I suggested the format, and the AI simply followed suit because it's smart enough to do so. Like I said, there is really no dialogue system or strict format of dialogue or anything else. At any point of the story you can initiate a dialogue sequence like this. In fact, one of my favorite things to do is to create some characters in world info and not even take part in the story myself at all! I just watch the characters interact in dialogue like this and sit back—without a ""you"" in the mix at all.

Unless of course by dialogue system you mean that the Say command would output: ""You: \\[your text\\]. Yes, that could work. In most cases I think the AI should be able to take the hint and continue along with the same format. But the takeaway is that any AI Dungeon-based ""system"" is just a very loose layer on top of the actual AI. You're free to do whatever you like through the Story function (as opposed to Say and Do) and override the AI Dungeon format because at that point you are purely interfacing with GPT-3.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-12-14-194223","1639507343","None","1639508907.0","0","hojk8ad","False","t3_rg7lx7","False","t1_hojk8ad","False","t3_rg7lx7","/r/AIDungeon/comments/rg7lx7/how_a_dialogue_error_improved_the_playability_of/hojk8ad/","1645654169","9","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

Both, for the home screen, and the UI for adventures. With the ""Country stories"" thing, I'm pretty sure you're talking about scenarios. You can find scenarios in the ""Search"" tab (which *used* to be ""Explore""). Open the hamburger menu at the top left of the home screen, and there should be a button to go to the ""Search"" tab. There are options in the ""Search"" tab to see all scenarios, and to see NSFW scenarios.

As for the AI, the AI *has* changed since when AID2 first released. The ""Classic"" AI, which AID2 originally released with, and which used GPT-2, was removed months ago. ""Griffin"", which used to use GPT-3 Curie, now uses GPT-J 6B. ""Dragon"" uses GPT-3 Davinci, which is what it's used since it was introduced back in June or July of 2020. *However*, there is a filter enforced by OpenAI (the company that created GPT-3) that automatically switches you to a non-OpenAI model upon being triggered. The filter is intended to enforce OpenAI's [content policy](https://beta.openai.com/docs/usage-guidelines/content-guidelines), and switches you to either Griffin or Dragon-Beta when triggered. Dragon-Beta was introduced fairly recently, and uses Jurassic-1 Jumbo. Dragon-Beta is also currently worse than Dragon.

Also, it's possible the people in the videos were using Dragon.

As for not going off topic, my take is that those videos are edited (and the map graphics are created by him and not part of the game, just in case that wasn't clear). Partly this is for presentation and pacing, but it seems likely that he also may have cut out any responses that didn't fit the tone he was going for.

It just predicts a word (or subword token) at a time going left to right, so if you're writing dialogue the usual way where you indicate the speaker only after the quote (or implicitly), the AI itself is uncertain about who's talking while it's writing the dialogue. The chatroom format makes it much easier for the AI, too, to keep track of who's talking.

I don't quite go as far as using chat formatting, but I do make sure to always use at least a bit of action to break up any conversations that just turn into back-and-forth dialogue. That's in part to help the AI to not get confused, and in part because the AI has read a lot of terrible dialogue scenes that are just nothing but continuous talking, so it's perfectly happy to keep writing those scenes without adding any action itself.

Also BTW, as a general rule: The AI just predicts how your text could continue, in whatever format you gave it, just with bias toward what was more common in its training data. If you want it to continue using a chatroom format, just use the chatroom format yourself, and edit the results if the AI uses a different format.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-12-15-061308","1639545188","None","False","0","holy6vb","False","t3_rg7lx7","False","t1_holy6vb","False","t3_rg7lx7","/r/AIDungeon/comments/rg7lx7/how_a_dialogue_error_improved_the_playability_of/holy6vb/","1655901550","3","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

Latitude showed such absolute vile disregard for its player base, and betrayed its own commitment to provide an absolute open and free experience. The whole point of AID was NO restrictions. At the time this started it was very clear that the meaningless filter to limit erotic stories with younger characters was only meant to be the wedge for a larger scale censorship thing.

 They seem to have taken a step back as they probably got hit so hard by the backlash they saw the light at the end of the tunnel. However this do not change that Latitude is still a vile company that should have fallen into ruin at the time. I would strongly recommend looking for alternatives.

 I do not care what topics or whatever gets restricted. The fact that they at all think they should be in a position to restrict creative freedom at all. That a company should have a say in how people privately use their product. I absolutely do not think these guys deserve anyone's support any more...

 That being said, I would probably also not really have cared if I did not specifically dig into AID because they promoted values I supported. It is not as if Latitude's restrictions on AID are exceptional in any way. Chance is I would be playing around happily with AID now if it was a month ago that I discovered it. Not having had too much of a clue perhaps about any of their bad side.

 Oh and that is another problem in my view. So as I said before, it was obvious they had ideas to expand the restrictions. So here is my issue as someone who likes to really dig as deep, dark and gruesome as possible in what I write. How am I supposed to trust these guys now? How am I supposed to trust that what I write will not violate some nonsense restrictions they come up with in the future?

 And keep in mind. When they made restrictions and started to ban people and shit, they did that without actually letting anyone know. They just suddenly said people where breaking their rules. Despite there not being any rules to break.

 In fact, all their rules where strictly for sharing content. Even saying so on the rule page, to make it very clear they did not have rules against writing about anything in what people presumed to be on their private side of thing.

  These people knew, because the expectation was obvious. That people expected the stuff they did not share to not be read by others. Because duh they did not share it. But these absolute assholes still decided to read peoples stories. It is very hard for me not to see Latitude as being truly vile company with no regard for their user base at all.  

 \\-.- I am going to stop thinking about this now. I have moved to NovelAI and pretty much left this all behind me. But now that I happened to think about it again, I still feel the frustration, anger and sense of betrayal bloom again.

 And the 'but its a private company and can do whatever they want.' -.- God damn bs. They SHOULD not be able to do whatever they want. Specifically they should not be able to break with their promises and advertisement so easily. The fact that you can say you stand for something, and by giving money you are supporting that thing. Then the company can just 'I am free to do whatever I want screw you, I will take your money but not follow what I claimed to provide.'

 There should be laws restricting that crap. Laws should not focus on protecting companies. They should protect consumers. Citizens. Annoying! 

 Ohhh, the way they did it. And it would have been so easy not to piss people off so badly. Just make it clear the rules will change. Change the advertisement. Let people know the project is changing, so people do not just suddenly run into a glass wall.

https://www.reddit.com/user/non-taken-name/comments/ptuttv/copypasta\\_v\\_33/

This is the closest thing I've seen to a detailed ""full scoop"" on what happened, u/non-taken-name wrote this ""copypasta"" (a sort of deep-dive mini-article on the subject for people to spread around) with lots of links backing up the facts, and updated it several times as various users/former users collected information. The document has now been ""retired"" due to the indications that Latitude may be making positive steps, and was seemingly under the gun from OpenAI at the start of the ordeal. https://www.reddit.com/user/non-taken-name/comments/pyylqk/end\\_of\\_a\\_copypasta/ My only complaint about it being that in places it is maybe a bit too fervent for a fact-collecting work, but that's because it started out with outrage and then evolved into a fact-collecting exercise, as I understand it.

To give one instance of the drama, and perhaps the most damning: The training data for AIDungeon (top stories from a public ""choose your own adventure"" writing website) contained references to unsavory actions towards minors, violent and sexual - presumably much of the cause for ""pedophilic content"" that ended up in people's stories (this is also the reason for Count Grey et. al. as they are characters in those stories). All I saw from people personally were people making ""The AI said WHAT?!?!"" type posts when the AI said something weird or wrong involving a minor. Basically, Latitude probably didn't consider how important the ""vetting"" of their training data would be in the future or didn't think of a good way to do it (or someone on the team was creepy), so it looks like they just used some of the top stories from that site. Eventually this caught up with them and it turned into chaotic screaming (and people furiously voting down the AIDungeon app, lol) whilst Latitude hardly uttered a word for months.

E.G Had my character smash someone's head through a window and decapitate them with the sharp edges liie a makeshift gullotine.

And in my recent one, My MC pinned someone to the ground and started smashing their face into the concrete with his fist, Even describing the mask getting splintered and the blood spraying from each punch, Before forcefully and repeatedly smashing their head against the ground until it busted open.

Actual Excerpts written by the Ai: 

"" Wrapping your chain around your left fist, You pin him down and relentlessly smash his face with your chain-wrapped fist, his mask cracking and splintering.

Your teeth clench tighter and your vision gets more red as you continue to violently beat his head into the a splintered concrete of the street, Blood and bits of skull splatter painted red against the pavement. But you're not done. Despite your fists now being soaked in the blood of his barely recognizable face through the mostly shattered mask, you grip his neck with both hands and start brutally smashing the back of his head into the pavement as hard as you can, until his skull is caved-in and blood is sprayed everywhere.

It would be great to have an issue tracker too, in the same page, have both a bug and a feature suggestion tab in the same website

Although; what if it was in the AID web itself inestead of separate? It might make it much more accesible as we all already have accounts there, and the authenthication can be done via the accounts we have already inestead of a separate website (to prevent multi-voting or something like that)

Like on the sidebar with settings, help, my stuff

There was a 'Feedback' tab where you click and get a bug tracker and a suggestion system,  the suggestion systrm has voting, and the more votes the higher its shown on the list,  with a status bar per post with

- Being worked on
- Under consideration
- Rejected
- Complete

And a bug tracker with a voting system as well based on how disruptive it is (the higher it is, the more users voted it as disruptive and the higher priority) with status such as

- Fixed
- Not a bug
- In progress

You are the sexy, sexy number six.  As the number 6, you believe yourself to be the most erotically-charged number to have ever existed - far sexier than fugly 5 or fat and stupid 7.  Today, as you sit in the Number Court awaiting the other numbers, you see that your sexy number has arrived...

""So, what brings you here today? You look a little bored."" The Judge says.

&gt; You ask the judge why he is here.

The Judge looks at you with an expression of disgust. ""I am here because I was sentenced to death by lethal injection for murder!"" He screams.

""Oh no! That's not true! You're innocent!""

&gt;  You promise the judge that you will prove his innocence using your Sexy Number Six powers.

""Please, pretty please prove my inno-"" The judge begins to beg.

""I will prove your innocence by using my sexy, powerful body.""

&gt; You flex sexily before the court and ask if someone this sexy could possibly be mistaken about matters of innocence and guilt.

The judge shakes his head. You step back, and realize you've stepped out of the court's presence.

""It has been a long day, and I am far too tired to argue about this."" You think.

&gt;  You declare the judge innocent with your Sexy Powers, then return home.

You prove the Judge's innocence, then return home, where you sleep a dreamless sleep. Sadly, however, you do not live happily ever after...

&gt; You wake up to see what unhappy things have happened.

You open your eyes to find yourself lying on the sofa in your living room. ""Damn,"" you think. ""I was really getting into that dream.""

&gt; You examine yourself carefully to see what reality is.

You are a well-developed young man. You are slightly tanned (perhaps you spent too much time outdoors), and are tall and strong, standing at 6'2.

&gt; You examine your body more carefully to see if you are sexy.

You have a hairy body, but it's not excessively so. You have a defined stomach, solid chest and bulging arms. You don't have much body hair anywhere, though.

&gt; You find an equally-sexy woman and ask her for her opinion on your body.

You find an equally-sexy woman, and begin to ask her about her body. She is equally hairy.

""I like your body,"" she tells you.

""Your body is sexy.""

&gt; You flex triumphantly and tell her she can inspect it more carefully.

You begin to flex, but notice that your muscles appear more yellower and stretchier in the light. The woman's eyes widen, as does your dog's.

&gt; You say ""Alas!  My body has become yellow and stretchy.  I am undone by my own sexiness.""

As you speak, you slowly melt into a puddle of stretchy, sexy yellow goo.

You have found the perfect way to attract a mate.

&gt; You wait for a mate to be attracted by this puddle of stretchy, sexy yellow goo.

Sadly, no woman has ever been attracted by this pile of sticky yellow goo. Meanwhile, you spend the rest of eternity as a slimy pool of stretchy, sexy yellow goo.

&gt; One eternity later, try to reform your body out of the goo.

You form yourself back out of the sticky, sexy yellow goo, but it takes you a long time to reform your body. Your dog, however, has died instantly.

""Yuck! This is not sexy!""

&gt; You hold a funeral for your poor dead dog.

You hold a funeral for your dead dog, and everyone agrees that it is a fitting tribute to your loyal and honest canine companion.

Sometime later...

You have found the perfect way to attract a mate.

&gt; You attract an entire harem of highly-sexy mates.

You go to the local bar and throw your hat on the floor. The barkeep takes pity on you and gives you a beer. The next person to walk in the bar picks up your hat.

&gt; You say ""This does not appear to be attracting any sexy mates at all!""

Your hat has now been replaced by a giant, inflatable sex toy, which is now attracting several sets of eyes.
""Hmm, hat or not, that looks like a pretty big dick,"" one the miners says.

&gt; You scratch your head and scan the area for possible sexy mates.

One of the miners, a pretty blonde woman you once tried to flirt with but was unsuccessful, walks in the bar.
""There you are,"" she says. ""I've been looking all over for you.""

&gt; You ask her if she finds you sexy and wants to mate with you.

""Erm, well...,"" she begins to say.

""Come on, don't be shy,"" another miner says.

You attempt to kiss her, but she resists.

""Stop!""

&gt; You point to your inflatable sex toy hat and remind her that it is very sexy.

""Fuck, yeah,"" a third miner says. ""You find that hat sexy, don't you, honey?""

The woman looks at your hat, looks at you, and then smiles.

&gt; You smile back at her.

""I guess so,"" she says bashfully.

""Come on, let's get out of here,"" she says.

&gt; You take the woman home to your sexy, sexy sex palace.

You walk around town with the woman for a bit. It's nice to spend time with her.

""So, where do you live?"" she asks.""

Oh, about an hour's walk west from here.""

&gt; You explain to her that you may be a bit out of date on stuff due to spending an eternity as a sexy puddle.

You take her to a quiet spot and finally kiss her. She's a good kisser.

""So...,"" she says afterwards, ""you mind if I ask you something?""

""Go for it.""

""What the hell happened to you?""

You explain your story, and she seems quite fascinated by it.

&gt; You ask her if she thinks it is a sexy story.

""Oh yeah,"" she says. ""It's a sexy story.""

""Good,"" you say. ""I'm glad you think so.""

""I don't think it's a sexy story,"" she says.

&gt; You ask her why she immediately contradicted herself!

""I told you it was sexy,"" she says. ""It is a sexy story.""

&gt; You examine her carefully to validate her own sexiness.

She's about five foot one, she has curly brown hair that goes down to her hips and curls at the end, she has an average sized ass, and a pretty face.

&gt; You use your dominion over all things sexy to make her substantially sexier.

She is now so sexy that she literally turns into sex incarnate.

""Holy shit,"" she says, staring at her hands. ""This is some serious powers you have.""

""Yeah, I guess.""

&gt; You make her even more sexy.

She unbuttons her shirt, revealing a set of  hummingbird wings.

""I want you now,"" she says. ""Can we go to your place?""

&gt; You say ""Sure. By the way, sexy hummingbird wings.""

She smiles and wraps her arms around you.

""Let's go,"" she says.

It takes more work than you might think to maintain multiple UIs, so if not enough people are asking for it then they may not see it as worthwhile. I liked the old one too and I'd prefer to see them continue to offer it, but I can also appreciate why they wouldn't.

EDIT: They only have the resources to support a finite number of features without assigning additional staff toward maintaining them, which might not adequately offset the long term potential profit. There's also an opportunity cost in that if they've got someone keeping a mostly-unused UI up to date then that person isn't working on some other feature that might be even more profitable.

Though, as someone who's not a current user I'm a little confused. It sounds to me like OP is actually describing the original layout, which was just blocks of text without any graphical formatting, rather than the newer one with the action icons and all that. Is OP saying that they reverted back to a text-only display?

EDIT: The AI wouldn't be reacting to this in any case. It doesn't see the story in the same format that we do, so any interface changes wouldn't matter to it.

That is unfortunate.   
That OpenAI model is super restricted, yeah even though I heard AI Dungeon's one doesn't have as much stuff as it, it is significantly less so, would recommend using theirs over the Open AI one.   
It's a shame, because what you said wasn't even horrific or anywhere near, it was funny.  
But trying the convince the people at OpenAI about anything would be an uphill battle on an infinite cliff of stubbornness.  
Pardon the tangent, I hope that AIDungeon's personal and less restricted Dragon bot will work for you.   


They are trying to move away from the restrictions imposed by OpenAI and build their own AI, but that'll take a bit more time to work with,build up, and get right.

You're paying a big ass subscription fee, so you'd want the best there is for the product.   
I have no idea when, but they shared a roadmap and they've been following it well from what I've seen, my hopes are high for them at the moment.  
Whenever you follow these big companies, it seems that they make the most progress when they're not fatigued about an individual aspect, so they're not ground down into dust and losing all motivation. I trust that they'll focus and get a nice product out there, and they've been more open with discussions of things so my faith in them has been rekindled as it were.  
No excuses for them, just hopefully some  understanding as I try to wrap my head around it some more and think about it way too much in a random spiral going nowhere.

I don't deal directly with the AI/ML but I do work at Latitude. I'll try to give you some insight. It's not ""official Latitude info"", just my impressions so take it with a grain of salt. If you want direct answers from Nick or the team, definitely hit the official AID discord. We've come out of the ""Fortress of Solitude"". Yea!    


First, if you didn't know, Open AI (the creators of GPT-3) have changed their content policies again to be even *more* restrictive than before and yes, they are enforcing them. It's completely out of our control. I think it's difficult to play AID and *not* trigger their restrictions honestly.  


Dragon21 is even (slightly) larger than GPT-3 so we have a lot of hope for it, but it is also extremely new. Latitude and others are still figuring out how to get the most out of this awesome new model.  I know the team is working on figuring out latency issues as I write this. I also see that they are working on repetition and other quality control issues so expect changes soon. It took Latitude a while to get GPT-3 working at peak back in the day too.  


So good news, progress is being made and I have a lot of hope that Dragon21 is going to be an amazing experience in the near future. Latitude is making improvements on it every day so I hope everyone can hang in there.

The crew was really happy to have me aboard for some reason, and I found out it was mostly because, since my character was a priest, I could give them all their last rites if we all died at sea.

Of course, we didn't get far before a storm, and after the storm back by a random ship go on an interception course with us, which turned out to have a very buff demon lord standing on the prow, arms crossed, and with a crew of other demons on board. 

Seriously, you can't get on a boat without duelling an OP demon lord, can't walk in the forest without coming across half a dozen cults and random knights that try to chase you down on horseback in your modern day setting, can't go to a hospital without getting murdered, meeting the devil himself, and waking up in hell, or having to escape from mad science experiments, and so on.

As the Xlbingo10 said, you have to hold its hand, sometimes setting the scene with something like You set the dinner table and are sitting across from X, and then continue from there, maybe describing the clothing either of you are wearing and then hitting the continue button. **If you don't like what the AI outputs after that, you can just erase it and just put a say/do command, maybe drinking some wine or cutting into your food as you talk to whoever it is as they sit across from you.**  


**Sometimes doubling down on things is necessary in descriptions or sentences, it can feel redundant, but getting a relevant output from the AI is well worth the redundancy in my opinion as long as you consider it just that**. If it helps your enjoyment ensuring things go along by guiding it will be an option to you and a skill, unless you wish to continue with the STD that the AI will forget you have unless you put it into its memory/authors notes.  


If you enjoy the silliness and are not bothered by it I hope that you enjoy it.  
If not, there are small tips above.

I mean, I've had short bouts where I think that the AI might have dipped in quality, but usually, after a little bit of modifying the world info and pinned, it'd improve, but recently, it's just tanked.  


It doesn't seem to have come with the introduction of the filter update, since that day and the day after, it was still functioning fine AFAIK. I think like 2 days ago, though, Dragon-OA just showed that it was now completely incapable of remembering tone.   


I'm sure it's fine for people who use the site jokily because it still kinda-sorta gets what's going on. However, I've seen the Dragon-OA AI be fairly impressive with consistency and clever output (yes, even in 2021), but now it feels like I'm using Griffin or I turned randomness up all the way. It feels like the AI just sort of follows the very last line of input and then does whatever the hell it wants. I've also noticed the weird multiple-choice options and video game-style 'What do you want to do now?' prompting coming up a lot more often, probably because the AI can't seem to tell what the user is going for anymore.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-12-25-191114","1640455874","None","False","0","hpxrkk9","False","t3_rnvv2q","False","t1_hpxrkk9","False","t3_rnvv2q","/r/AIDungeon/comments/rnvv2q/i_know_that_claiming_the_ai_is_getting_worse_is_a/hpxrkk9/","1645646011","8","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","","",""

* For unpublished content, the AI is trained to avoid problematic content but won't get you banned and isn't reviewed by any actual mods. Still, lost trust and all that lol
* Dragon-OA now has additional content filters due to restrictions of Open AI. You get a warning when you hit these walls. The filter isn't too strict but seems inconsistent.
* They are now producing Dragon-21 which lacks such restrictions, but it's still pretty shoddy and nowhere near where Dragon-OA was at.
* And I say **was** because Dragon OA decided to go the shitter a couple of days ago. Presumably, the devs are messing with something. Updates haven't addressed this, so I have no clue if or when it will improve. Currently, it's worth no more than Griffin.
* Conclusion: It probably is not the best time to dive back into AI dungeon.
* Guess I should check out Novel AI or something :')

The child filter thing was not exactly removed, but they changed their approach.As far as I remember, this means that there is no more moderator review for unpublished stories. So as long as you weren't publishing your story anymore, the AI would just be trained to **avoid** icky child abuse in stories, and you can't really be banned for your personal stuff afaik.I haven't experienced it freaking out over any number under 18 and the like. I personally haven't had any issue with it, but I'm sure it depends on what exactly you're writing. Plus, some others have still lost trust in the company's privacy standards- blah blah politics, maybe insecure data, I dunno... Here is the update they posted, anyway.

&gt;We've thought a lot about some of the concerns users have shared with us on our approach to moderation and what happens in unpublished stories and we've decided on new path that we think will resolve a lot of those concerns. Read more about it here:[https://latitude.io/blog/the-walls-approach](https://latitude.io/blog/the-walls-approach)

Also, if the whole child filter debacle pissed you off, you may be bugged about the new content filters for Dragon-OA which I believe are required by Open AI (not Latitude, ig?)I find them decently hard to hit, but they're also highly inconsistent, which is... fun. Everyone loves those wacky nebulous filters!

They are developing their own Dragon-21 AI without these restrictions, though. For a hot minute, it was platinum only but now it's open to gold, I guess. Progress is... slow so far. Definitely not up to par with what Dragon-OA was.

Personally, I think it's still been doing pretty decent, but they must be fucking around with something because the Dragon-OA suddenly went to shit one day, and I have no idea when or if it's going to get better.

I'm just annoyed the devs haven't addressed it at all. I get these sort of fluctuations in quality are hard to avoid, but it's hard to want to stay subscribed when it can just suddenly change like this without warning.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-12-26-042343","1640489023","None","False","0","hpzj7kn","False","t3_rnvv2q","False","t1_hpzj7kn","False","t1_hpyrlh6","/r/AIDungeon/comments/rnvv2q/i_know_that_claiming_the_ai_is_getting_worse_is_a/hpzj7kn/","1645641920","11","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","","",""

I would say the difference is more than just being trained differently, though.

 It was when they just suddenly pulled the floor out from under everyone, implementing filters secretly, scanning and reading peoples presumed private stories. All completely against their promises, advertisement and 'mission statements'. THAT was when they where stealing money.

 That was part of what pissed me so damn much off. I was throwing money at them because I loved what they where providing. I was somewhat unhappy about them restricting what stories could be shared, wanting them to instead possibly make an 'extreme' optional thingy. But the promised dedication to not limit players creativity and everything. How amazingly good the AI was, and the promises that my money would help improve the game. ... Then they went and stabbed me in the back. Even using 'think of the poor children' as a damn dagger to get... that... knife... tip... in. They picked the worst thing they could think of and used it as an excuse to start filtering.

 Dammit, I am still getting angry thinking about it! I feel so tricked. So scammed. WHY? Its not as if it would not have been possible to change things in at least a slightly reasonable way.  ""Hey guys, we are kinda forced to change stuff. So starting from next month, we will be implementing a filter, and we will limit various topics. We will naturally make a list of the stuff you can not write about any more -bla-bla.""

 It... I just can not believe how they did it. These utter swine like bastards, they did not even change their advertisement or company front page for what I think was months after.

 People tried to make reasonable suggestions trying to limit how bad things would get. But they shut... that... down.

 I am sure Latitude was chocked they could not get away with putting in a filter when they used the excuse for making it as they did. However they probably had no idea the filter itself would be so bad.

 I can imagine them feeling quite frustrated about just how bad the hit they took was and is doing their best to lap together their reputation. Personally I am saddened to see how little it impacted them. In my view what happened was really, really bad.

As such, AID freezing was likely not due to your computer being unable to handle it, as none of the computing is done on your own PC. Speaking from experience, even weak devices can typically handle AID perfectly fine.

Anyways, those reviews are about the controversy that started back in April. There's a [very detailed post on r/HobbyDrama about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/otzp7l/video_games_ai_dungeon_how_to_cause_your/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=mweb3x), if you want to read it.

To keep things short, the devs implemented a filter to prevent pedophilic content, but said filter was absolutely *horrible*, being triggered by any sexual content regardless of the context, numbers below 18, the simple mention of children, certain animals, etc. Shortly after the introduction of the awful filter, a suspension system was introduced that could automatically temporarily ban you from AID if you triggered the filter too much. Alongside this, the devs would also manually review anything that triggered the filter, which some saw as an invasion of privacy. There was also a data breach in which a ton of private stories were obtained by a hacker, and said breach went undisclosed by the devs for months. Private stories had also been crowdsourced to strangers on the internet for moderation, on a website called TaskUp (which a lot of people were understandably upset about, but which turned out to be the doing of OpenAI, which is the company that used to provide all of AID's AI models, but which currently only provides the Dragon-OA model). I might be forgetting some parts of the controversy, because there was a lot to it, but you get the gist.

Anyways, I'm not sure what the ""free features monetized"" part of that review is about. There *are* a few features you have to pay for, but said features were never free to begin with. I can't really speak for whether or not the AI was ever ""downgraded""; I only use Griffin, which is the one free model, and I never noticed any real difference with Griffin, but Griffin was also just never exactly stellar to begin with. I also can't say whether or not Dragon ever dropped in quality, as I don't use it. As someone that's played AID since February of 2020, I can also say that the AI derailing the story has *always* been an issue, even more so in the early days of AID than it is now. I also don't really get the complaint about the AI writing less than before. AID's output trimming causes outputs to vary greatly in length to begin with, so it's always been capable of generating exceedingly short responses. Besides, if you want the AI to generate more text, you can simply press the Enter button to make it generate more.

As for the other stuff, the filter is nowhere near as bad as it used to be, and no longer applies to the AI. In my testing, it's *completely* unnoticeable at the moment. There are no longer bans or suspensions for triggering the filter, nor are there manual reviews of content that triggers the filter. As I mentioned earlier, the whole TaskUp situation was OpenAI's doing, rather than Latitude's, and Latitude has seemingly been working towards ditching OpenAI for the past couple of months. Griffin *used* the use OpenAI's GPT-3 Curie model, but now uses the open-source GPT-J 6B model. There's also now the Dragon-21 model, which uses Jurassic-1 Jumbo, and is meant as an alternative to Dragon-OA, which uses OpenAI's GPT-3 Davinci model (although Dragon-21 is, unfortunately, currently worse than Dragon-OA). The data vulnerability was apparently also fixed, although Latitude took *way* too long to disclose the breach (5 months, to be more specific).

Overall, AI Dungeon has mostly recovered from the controversy, and most of the issues that appeared during the controversy have been fixed. The rating on the Play Store has also been steadily rising back up for a while, although it's still obviously pretty low. At one point, the Play Store rating literally got down to, like, 2.0 or 2.1 stars.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-12-27-003050","1640561450","None","False","0","hq2xqre","False","t3_rp7k71","False","t1_hq2xqre","False","t3_rp7k71","/r/AIDungeon/comments/rp7k71/is_everything_alright_with_aidungeon/hq2xqre/","1645634141","40","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","","",""

Users always had to edit mistakes or try generating again, plus being mindful that their writing style and how much exposition they give will reflect on what's generated.

What helps a lot is using memory, storing current information there (what's in your inventory, who are you traveling with, etc.) and removing it when it's no longer relevant helps the AI.

Use world info if you have patience and want a more cohesive environment and characters.

As for editing mistakes, it's a good idea, also editing the way you want your text formatted or writing style to help AI learn.

And speaking writing style, author's notes are great for that.

I believe the new filter just throws you into the dragon21 model and blocks you out if GPT3. Which is much less noticeable than a ban. I think that is what people mean by downgrading the AI.

I know any 18+ content triggers the switch from dragon to the much weaker dragon21 model. I have heard people say violence and gore does too, but since I jumped ship I can no longer test that.

A large number of us got very uncomfortable with how things are being handled, especially the privacy issues, and left for alternatives. The alternatives are not nearly as good as the dragon AI (AID’s paid version) but at least we know we have our privacy and that the model won’t be swapped out to a weaker one for tripping a filter.

Things you can try,  
**1. setting the scene while keeping in mind the pattern you wish to avoid.**  


**2. you can practically write anything you wish, try talking longform about the Kingdom or what it's inhabitants are doing, long enough for the AI to understand that the pattern you are choosing is more favorable, it is a text predicting machine, if you let it get away with something like a pattern, or even something like turning your character crazy or some other wonk, when it is not wanted, it must be corrected, or enough stuff must be typed breaking away from that pattern for it to take.**   


**3. If you notice a pattern like above happening, fix it immediately, or it can wreck an otherwise nice/cool/whatever story. It can still be fixed, it'll just take quite a bit longer the, longer you go along with it(The AI thinks it is acceptable). You will not hurt its feelings if you correct it, so do not hold back.**  


**4. ?????????**

One time, pre-AI-lobotomy, I switched to Dragon 21 and forgot to switch back and the only thing that went through my head was 'Hm, the quality of outputs has decreased slightly I wonder why..' but paid not much mind to it.

As for my two cents:

The biggest paid alternatives are NovelAI and HoloAI. They are quite similar in what they offer regarding the AI itself, but NovelAI does beat the latter in customization options and have a larger team. The HoloAI devs (three right now) have been looking to hire more, admittedly. There's also the free KoboldAI which is mostly community-run now, but it takes little bit of time to setup (you can run it locally or on the Google Colab servers, of which I recommend the Colab servers due to the hefty requirements to run an AI model locally).

I'd say the largest factor between them is the cost. NovelAI's minimum package is $10/month without AI customization steps included (essentially tokens allowing you to train the AI how you want on a certain amount of data). The highest tier does give you those as part of it, but that it $25/month.

HoloAI is $5/month for 500k characters (about 3,333 actions), or $8 for unlimited usage with free access to beta features and AI customization tokens included in your monthly $8 sub.

If it is worth anything, I think the devs at HoloAI are some of the best I've purchased something from. They are constantly active with the community and are very helpful -- when things go wrong on their end, they give out free months of subscription time to make up for it which is nice. I was originally a skeptic for the project when it was first announced considering how little information there was surrounding it, but it's safe to say that I'm a fan now (I run r/HoloAI).

NovelAI is another great alternative, and the landscape may have changed a bit since I last added to my list, but HoloAI and NovelAI are still the two largest competitors that I can think of on the market that care about the privacy issues.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-12-30-202348","1640892228","None","False","0","hql0e9l","False","t3_rp7k71","False","t1_hql0e9l","True","t1_hqksxul","/r/AIDungeon/comments/rp7k71/is_everything_alright_with_aidungeon/hql0e9l/","1645593055","2","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","","",""

NovelAI lets you train your own AI which I believe works alongside the default one to tilt the scales towards themes and styles you train it on. I've not fiddled with that too much, need enough free time to do my research and do it right. The default selection of models has generally done well by me, so I've not rushed to making my own.

They got bias settings, just simply making a word more or less likely to be used.

A bunch of different sliders to make smaller tweaks. Like adjusting how harsh the repetition penalties are and such.

So I assume HoloAi is close to the same?","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-12-30-215251","1640897571","None","False","0","hqle1xu","False","t3_rp7k71","False","t1_hqle1xu","False","t1_hqkz1o0","/r/AIDungeon/comments/rp7k71/is_everything_alright_with_aidungeon/hqle1xu/","1645592068","2","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","","",""

HoloAI has custom modules which you can train yourself and put into the game -- or other peoples modules, if you desire.

Advanced Settings such as repetition penalties are also available along with incentivizing or disincentivizing the usage of certain words/phrases by the AI.
