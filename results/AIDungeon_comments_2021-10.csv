The AI's tendency to generate inappropriate content is not some unavoidable aspect of AI in general, it is a reflection of the specific data it was trained on. That data was selected by humans.

I'm not sure exactly how the filter will behave now, but if the filter only limits the AI's responses, it might function like a crude replacement for better training. The AI has always been a reflection of the developers' unseen choices in training and implementation, leading responses away from some topics and into others. The filter would just be a much more visible way of the developers guiding the responses.

Of course, this new way of viewing it only makes sense in the context of their new policy that doesn't punish the player. Their previous policy could only be interpreted as trying to limit the player, even if the AI was the one who misbehaved. This new policy can be interpreted in a more positive light, assuming they stick by it. (Obviously, ~~OpenAI~~ ClosedAI is still more than willing to blame the user as their behavior makes clear.)

I've never triggered the filter in all the time I'd been playing with it there in AID, even up 'til the day I ended my sub, but I worry if I come back to AID that, if I did magically somehow end up triggering OpenAI's filter one too many times even in single-player, I'd be banned from ever using Dragon again. I don't want to chance paying for Platinum like I was and then turn around to find out I've been forbidden from using Dragon when it'd be what I'm specifically paying to access.

Because if that does work out to the point that OpenAI will no longer issue bans for single-player and entrust the filter to function, and with the filter not overreacting and banning or flagging for review and all that business, I'd genuinely, strongly consider returning to AID again.

I'd appreciate any clarification on this, at least as much as you can right now, if possible, so thanks in advance. :) And I may not respond or anything right away, since I'm dealing with a stomach bug and need to rest, but I just happened to see this whole big post beforehand, so I figured I'd pop in and see what's what before I laid down for a while.

By the time I bailed on it (the same day the filter was announced), it had deteriorated to the point where I thought they were foisting Griffin off on customers who had paid for Dragon.  That's apparently not the case, mind you, since Griffin users were complaining about a drop in quality as well.  

Using Dragon at that point was like collaborating on a story with a barely interested 8 year old with attention deficit disorder.  The deterioration was extremely noticeable and had been going on for weeks by that point.  I was already ready to quit when the filter was announced.

Now things might very well have gotten better again since then, and I genuinely hope that's true (although nothing about your example suggests that's the case -- not sure if you're using Dragon or Griffin).

Though, You've missed some stuff. Lat decided on a new approach that won't ban the users and private work no longer is read and moderated. Instead the filter triggers only for the ai. Meaning the ai will either output something that the filter won't get triggered by if it can find a suitable output, or send a message saying it can't find a suitable output. So you won't get banned for what the ai says anymore, And you're more free to write what you want without it getting read.

Also the content policy got an update. It basically said the stuff Latitude are against seemingly cannot be published but won't get you banned for being written privately (E.G necrophilia) and i scanned through it for mentions of Violent content, And it only said Trivializing/Glorifying Sexual violence is frowned upon. So i guess this means Gory stories are okay to write.

And the inciting violence and all part has been clarified to ""don't harass or threaten other users and don't Impersonate anyone from Latitude.""","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-10-01-182802","1633105682","None","False","0","hezphwx","False","t3_pz9atv","False","t1_hezphwx","True","t1_hezapwh","/r/AIDungeon/comments/pz9atv/pleez_help/hezphwx/","1647714693","3","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None",""

I don't recall any indication of Latitude sending information to authorities to try to create real-world legal consequences for those who have ""misused"" their system. There's a huge difference between ""unreasonably calling someone a pedophile and refusing to provide them a service"" and ""actively trying to get someone arrested for supposedly mentioning child molestation."" Both may be overreactions, but one has far more severe consequences.

I still think Latitude has demonstrated poor judgment over the past few months, but they're trying to find a better way. We have yet to see if they are truly serious about all this, but shouldn't a change in direction be praised? I suspect many people will still be reluctant to give them money again, but that doesn't mean they can't praise Latitude's change in direction.

I honestly didn't really care about any of the 9 features listed as considered for possible removal. I honestly didn't even know some of them were even a thing (Skills?).

But, two things stand out to me as things that would be an improvement to the system as-is.

1. Better filter detection, leading to fewer false positives.
2. Ability to train the AI.

I don't mind the filter, but I have noticed a few odd instances where the filter will improperly flag a character as underage seemingly due to the use of parental words, like ""mom/dad"" or ""mother/father"". And even then, it's inconsistent. 

In regards to training, I just think some better training material should be used. Some of the stuff can be a bit dry and unimaginative. It's not all bad, though. The reality is, outputs frequently surprise me with the crazy stuff it can understand and expand upon. 

Other than that, I have no real complaints about AID.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-10-01-212125","1633116085","None","False","0","hf0djt5","False","t3_pzbhpr","False","t1_hf0djt5","False","t3_pzbhpr","/r/AIDungeon/comments/pzbhpr/the_future_of_ai_dungeon_wed_like_your_input/hf0djt5/","1647713173","37","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None",""

Since this was OpenAI doing it and not Latitude, my guess is that they don't have this info any more than we do. Maybe OpenAI would disclose that in order to disclose it to the people affected, but Latitude isn't the company to lean on to make that happen.

As for Latitude, I'm sure they were just as outraged about this as we are.

Maybe I should clarify. Stopping people from producing child pornography even if it's fictional does not take away from the experience of the victims. I don't know in which way you twist your mind to think that and it's honestly disrespectful towards them. Their experiences are real, they happened and no one can take that away anymore.

From what I remember from when Explore was still around, there were usually only about 15 or so scenarios uploaded per hour, and *less* than that during the late night. There were maybe... *twice* as many adventures being uploaded as there were scenarios. So a filtering system for published content probably wouldn't be too difficult to implement. However, I still don't think the system proposed really makes sense. If a scenario or adventure triggers the filter, the filter isn't going to be able to discern whether it is ""really bad"" (in which case it would apparently make you replace some of the text) or ""not really bad"" (in which case it would apparently upload the scenario, but without it being publicly available, and it'll be manually reviewed). The filter triggering to begin with means that the filter is assuming you're doing something bad. The filter isn't sentient and capable of determining whether or not it correctly flagged something. Also, the filter isn't a basic word filter like before, so it doesn't really make sense for it to be able to highlight what's triggering the filter.

If the filter were to apply to published content, I think it should work something more like this. If someone uploads something that *doesn't* trigger the filter, it's just uploaded then and there. No issues. If someone uploads something that *does* trigger the filter, it should be flagged for manual review, and be stuck in a sort of ""Review pending"" status; not the usual ""Not published"" or ""Published"" status that typically shows for content.

That I can agree on. You might be right that this is something they’d have considered if they knew how all of this would play out.

EDIT: I will say that I don’t think it’s a bad suggestion. Having access to their own fully-owned model would also have interesting development potential, since there are a lot of things they can’t do now because they simply don’t have complete access. I’m just looking at it from the standpoint of spending millions on something they can basically have for free if they just wait for Eleuther to finish making it.

EDIT 2: I would be in favor of switching Dragon over to a more moderately sized non-OpenAI model, once one does become available.

I have since come around to the idea that anything in fiction, regardless of how depraved, sick, or immoral, is fine so long as it remains in the realm of fantasy. I was interested to learn about the abuse survivors who used dark fiction as a coping mechanism. It has been scientifically proven that indulging in dark fantasies, specifically sexual ones, does not correlate to actually committing atrocities. I personally did not indulge in that variety of darker fiction, but I found it very educational to speak with those who did.

So when Ai dungeon gutted itself in an attempt attempt to presumably protect non-existent children, I was irritated at the sudden downgrade of the AI, but kept with it. After all, it's their company oh, they have the right to keep whatever content they don't feel comfortable with out of their app. I just wished they'd done it more delicately and had... ya know. Told us they were going to do it.

Then when Alan made smart-ass comments, I started to get angry. But I stuck with it a little longer. Then came the security leaks. And the manual reviews. And the general mismanagement.

Finally, when Latitude released a statement along the lines of ""don't use our app to cope with trauma"" that was it for me. I cancelled my subscription and switched. That was an active slap in the face as far as I was concerned.

I really enjoyed using AI dungeon. And I'm actually willing to come back as a paying customer, but more than things like Explorer coming back, or de-lobotomizing the ai, I need some kind of assurance that this sort of malicious, puritanical, and judgemental incompetence won't be returning to Latitude.

The ""wall"" approach seems like a good idea, but the problem isn't implementing protections against fantasies that's stopping me from coming back. It's a matter of trust. Trust that Latitude isn't going to make these mistakes again. Trust that I, as a consumer, can feel safe using this product. And Trust that the community won't be vilified for words on a screen. 

The wall method seems like an improvement if the safety of these non-existent children is paramount but you actually want a functioning product.

If they were, that would mean you can easily and freely get child pornography from the library. (Such as the underage gangbang in Stephen King's *IT*.)

Child pornography is bad because it involves *abusing real children.* There are plenty of kinds of porn that I find very concerning and think represent an underlying mental disorder, but that doesn't mean I can tell consenting adults what they can or cannot do. The reason child pornography is different is because it involves the abuse of real children who legally cannot consent.

Fictional ""rape porn"" depicts an act that would be illegal if it was not fictional. The illegality of the act being portrayed does not make a fictional depiction of it illegal. And some of that stuff is horrifying and deeply concerning, depicting extreme intentional psychological abuse, usually of women. If it is nevertheless fictional, no laws are being broken.

Fictional depictions of child molestation are messed up, no doubt about it. But that doesn't mean it comes even *vaguely* close to how horrifying actual child molestation is. The reason it's wrong is the terrible lingering effect it has on the child, not just because it's messed up.

Fighting a crusade against fictional depictions of child molestation is pointless. All the effort and money going into that could go into *preventing actual child abuse.* Because *that* is a worthwhile cause, instead of focusing on people's fantasy.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-10-02-191640","1633195000","None","False","0","hf4aqv2","False","t3_pzd49r","False","t1_hf4aqv2","False","t1_hf2ruhh","/r/AIDungeon/comments/pzd49r/i_thought_there_were_no_flags_for_unpublished/hf4aqv2/","1647704621","4","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

&gt;Your history of having betrayed your customers' trust

They do have a history of that, yes. How they behave going forward will determine whether or not that will continue to be a meaningful concern.

&gt;having shared their private stories with 3rd parties

Assuming this refers to the Taskup debacle, that was OpenAI, not Latitude.

&gt;handed out allegations of pedophilia

Please show where Latitude has done this. They have confirmed the factual existence of pedophiliac content that was created using their AI, but as far as I can tell the idea that they're out there indiscriminately calling people pedophiles is from people with a grudge putting words in their mouth.

&gt;pedophilic CYOA content *you* trained your AI on

Yes, not adequately vetting their training data was a spectacularly bad move. They claim that content has now been removed, which if true resolves the problem. Not putting it in to begin with would have been ideal, but they don't have a time machine.

&gt;That people have been autobanned for the text AI produced is also known

Personally I'd like to see more done to compensate those who were unjustly affected by this, but at least they've made the decision to stop doing it, so it won't create any new issues going forward.

&gt;Your point regarding ""millions of users"" is quite crass, however. That you have many customers does not mean you can treat them like dirt.

They said they stopped using that vendor, but what about the others?

Griffin-Beta is your in-house model (based on the open-source model GPT-J-6B made by Eleuther) so you can have full control over it, but what about Griffin and Dragon? Those are based on close-source models made by OpenAI, and we all know their tendency to overcontrol any service/project using their models. To clarify, I understand the difficulty of ditching OpenAI in your current state, but people's privacy is never fully guaranteed with those guys lording over Latitude and subsequently the users.

Before anyone accuses me of being the unsavory type that's afraid of having my stories read, I can say confidently that I am not. I may be embarrassed if someone reads my ~~terrible~~ fanfictions that I will never plan to share, sure, but nothing too terrible :)

This way, you can write your own stories how you want to without the fear of being banned or downgraded to a lower model. *Your* writing is *your* business, and it's great to see that you're finally taking steps in the right direction.

Here's my question, though... will this apply to the OpenAI model, or just the Latitude one?

   After that revelation the head mage was surprised and asked me if i originally died because of the war between the different kingdoms which did a lot of casualties against innocent civilians, i answered her question by revealed my tragic backstory of being a poor graveyard employee who died by slipping on a banana peel which greatly amused the local necromancer which who i had often business with and so he decided to raise me and in the end taught me all he knew because i kept nagging him.
   
  Finally i tough that  i finally got to her and that she would reveal how to get my groove back, she told me once again that i had to die so i decided to hit her with the chair i was sitting on which somehow made me grow tentacles which grabbed her and started draining her vital force (don’t ask my why i was supposed to be powerless, like apparently all mages in town) so i decided that if that happened that meab i had recovered my power somehow (which was nice) so i ripped her head off and use necromancy to reanimate her head that i used as an ornament on my wizard staff, forever screaming as i continue my adventure toward the capital where my necromancer mentor asked for my presence, leaving this town of crazy powerless mage behind me.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-10-03-081346","1633241626","None","False","0","hf70oyp","False","t3_pwbplu","False","t1_hf70oyp","True","t3_pwbplu","/r/AIDungeon/comments/pwbplu/i_asked_for_soup/hf70oyp/","1647698648","2","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

No one notices you and no one answers to you. Nothing is important and nothing will be.***

You're just a dead man walking. The world continues on as normal, but your mind wanders in the dark places of your soul.

\\&gt;

The voices that haunt your dreams whisper to you of things that never were or could not have been.

\\&gt;

The ghosts of your past lives tell you stories about other people who died without ever having existed. Your life has been a series of lies and hollow victories. A grand deception that only fools believe in. You've lost yourself in the illusion, and now it's time to let go.

\\&gt;

It's time to die.

\\&gt;

The world is too fucked up for you to continue living. It's time to move on with your life. There's no point in holding onto the past anymore; there was nothing worthwhile to hold onto anyway. All that matters is what lies ahead and the future lies before you.

\\&gt;

You need to start over. You need to live again.

\\&gt;

You don't know where to begin. Your life has been an endless cycle of failure and regret. You've spent most of it trying to fit into some mold that doesn't exist. You've tried everything from being a rock star, to a movie director, to a professional wrestler...

\\&gt;

Nothing works. There's something wrong with you. Something needs to change. You need to find out what that is, so you can finally get rid of this shadow inside of you that's been haunting your every waking moment since birth.

\\&gt;

You'll do anything to escape it. Anything at all.

\\&gt;

You're going to take your own life. You won't be able to hide it any longer. The truth will come out eventually, but right now you need to make sure that you get away with it. You'll do anything to escape it. Anything at all.

\\&gt;

You open your eyes and look around. You see nothing but darkness. Nothing except the blackness of space and the cold emptiness of space itself. Suddenly, you hear a voice in your head: ""Why are you still alive? Why did you waste your life here?

\\&gt;

What have you done with yourself?

\\&gt;

What have you become? How many lives have you wasted?

You feel like crying, but then you remember that you're not supposed to cry. This isn't a good place to do it. You close your eyes and try to ignore the voices in your head as best as possible.

\\&gt;

You wake up. It feels like someone took a knife to your chest and ripped out your heart. You can't breathe. Everything hurts. All of it.

\\&gt;

The pain is so great that you almost pass out again. But then you realize that there's no way for you to die here on this ship. There's nowhere left to go, and if there was, nobody would ever want or need you anymore anyway.

\\&gt;

So you decide to just keep lying down here until it gets better. Your body aches from the lack of oxygen, but you don't care about that right now. Your mind is too broken by the fact that you've lost everything else.

The lights are off, which means that it's nighttime. You sit up slowly and groggily stand up and walk over to the door of the room where you were sleeping.

\\&gt;

You push it open and step outside into the night. You turn your head slightly to one side, and you see something shining through the window. A bright light shines through the glass, illuminating the entire sky above you. It's a star!

\\&gt;

It's beautiful. It's overwhelming. It fills you with awe and wonder. You look at it for hours, staring at its glittering surface and watching it move across the sky, never staying still for long enough to be boring. And then...

\\&gt;

Suddenly, the stars begin to fade away. Suddenly, the world around you begins to blur together. You know what's happening; you've been here before once before when you were young and had your first love.

\\&gt;

You remember how you felt then, and you feel it again now. You're falling. Falling towards nothingness, towards oblivion, towards death itself. But then you hear a voice calling to you from somewhere within the darkness: ""Hey! Wake up!""

\\&gt;

You stare blankly ahead as you try to make sense of what you're seeing. The sky has changed. The sun is gone. There's only darkness, but it isn't dark like the moonlight or the stars' brightness.

\\&gt;

It's not even black. It's a deep purple, almost purplish-red.

\\&gt;

It looks so strange against the blackness of space.""What...?"" you say aloud, as if speaking to a ghost. There's no answer. You can barely make out anything beyond the edge of your vision, let alone any sort of words coming from there.

\\&gt;

The stars seem to have disappeared completely. They're all gone now, just like everything else. Your heart pounds in your chest, pounding faster than ever before. Your mind races, trying to process this new information. What do you do? Where are you going? Who are you?

\\&gt;

Why are you doing this? All these questions fill your mind, and they're all racing through your head at once. You don't know where you are, or why you're here. All that matters is that you need to get out of here.

\\&gt;

You want to run, but you can't move. You don't know where you are, or who you are. All that matters is that you need to get out of here. You turn your head slowly, searching for something in the darkness beyond your sight. Something familiar, perhaps?

\\&gt;

A memory? Or maybe... You look down at yourself. At your body, which seems to be made entirely of flesh and blood. Your skin is pale and wrinkled, but still very much alive. Your eyes are wide open, staring into the void below you.

\\&gt;

You see no life there, but somehow you imagine that it must exist somewhere. Perhaps it's some kind of energy that flows through you, or perhaps it's just the result of your own thoughts. Either way, you're alive.

\\&gt;

And then, suddenly, you feel an icy chill run up your spine. A cold that feels like it could kill you at any moment. This is the first time you've felt this way since waking up on board the ship.

\\&gt;

The last time was when you were trapped inside the ship with Jack. You gasp, and find yourself falling through nothingness. There's no air, only emptiness. You try to fight it, but it doesn't go away.

\\&gt;

It keeps growing stronger, and stronger. The world around you begins to fade into nothingness, until you're left standing in the middle of a dark abyss. You stare at the darkness, wondering what lies beyond it. Is this death? Or is this rebirth?

\\&gt;

You don't know. All you know is that you need to get out of here. You begin to float upwards, as if propelled by invisible hands. Suddenly, the world becomes brighter again, and you notice that your surroundings are beginning to change.

\\&gt;

Your vision clears, revealing a vast expanse of sky above you. It looks almost like the surface of another planet, except much bigger. And far more beautiful than anything you've ever seen before. You look around, taking in everything around you.

\\&gt;

Trees, mountains, rivers, lakes and seas. Everything is so different from the barren wasteland that was your home before. You look up at the sky once more, finding yourself staring at a massive black hole in the heavens. It appears to be swallowing up all of creation.

\\&gt;

You can't help but wonder what lies within. Maybe... There's something inside of you, waiting for someone to reach out and take it from you. Someone who cares about you enough to save you from your fate.

\\&gt;

Maybe... Or maybe... Perhaps you'll never escape this place. Maybe you'll spend eternity here, forever lost in a void of nothingness. Forever alone. Forever forgotten.

\\&gt;

Forever forgotten. Forever forgotten. Forever forgotten. Then, you will die, and your soul will be lost forever.

\\&gt;

But perhaps... Perhaps there is hope. Perhaps there is still a way out of this hellhole. Perhaps you can somehow escape this place.You have to try!

\\&gt;

You have to find a way out of this place! You begin to fly towards the black hole, hoping that you can somehow escape its grasp.

\\&gt;

You start to see stars above you, which seem to be coming closer and closer together. The black hole seems to grow larger every second, until it's almost touching the very edge of the universe itself.

\\&gt;

You can feel it closing in on you, as if it were sucking you into its depths. It's too late now, though. Your chance has already passed. You're doomed to wander through an endless void forever.

So it actually was my first story. I was a Bard named Chad (I was going for a comedic fantasy adventure but then it started getting weird). It started out pretty normal. I flirted with a lizardwoman named Stephanie and we set off. We found a wolf and I made it my pet. I called the wolf Winston.

So Stephanie wanted me to kill this wizard dude that attacked her village and we go to his fortress. I was very polite saying things like please and good sir and he let us in. Suddenly the wizard dude said I had to find Craxil the dark lord but he didnt know where he was so I went back to the city.

When I was back this guy named Matt suddenly inserted himself into my party and apparently Stephanie and Winston were missing. I hated Matt with a passion but decided I would convince the Craxil to torture him instead. So I met up with the Craxil in his fortress and he went on about how I'm a  Human Sword that's supposed to save the world but all I wanted was Steph and Winston back so we made a deal. I would find some magic sword for him and he will get my friends back. Looking back I dont think the A.I wanted me to help the bbg

When I exited the fortress a mob was there and started beating me up for helping Craxil and I went back inside where I proceeded to get beat up by Craxil. Soe guy named Sebasian healed me and now e are on an adventure together. I told him I wanted my friends but he brushed it off.

SO we go to this enchanted kingdom where I proceeded to team up with the demon called Semra Im supposed to kill and kill the king. Apparently Matt took all the credit and now he is the king so I bit his throat until he died and we teleported to an Island.

I asked Semra to teleport my friends to me but instead she teleported them to a different island. That made me made so I killed her. I havent continued that story cuz I missed Stephanie and Winston.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-10-03-121918","1633256358","None","False","0","hf7jw9m","False","t3_pff5eo","False","t1_hf7jw9m","False","t3_pff5eo","/r/AIDungeon/comments/pff5eo/whats_the_weirdest_story_any_of_you_guys_ever_made/hf7jw9m/","1647697460","2","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

You have to update and retrain the classifier, and then see how it handles things moving forward. 

Not sure if we’ve met, but I’m a newer head of product. Inevitably, we will find occasions where stuff comes through that we’ve said we don’t want. I have no issue owning up to when that’s the case and using those cases to adjust future training or fix a bug. 

But as we’ve started to address posts like this, while we have found instances where things aren’t functioning how we intend, most often users are hiding things in memory to trigger the filter then claim it was false, selectively taking the screenshot, or editing after the fact.

If the original poster gives us permission, we’re happy to look into this case, though our initial test shows they are unlikely to do so since the current filter wouldn’t allow the AI to say this.

AFAIK you can try all kinds of silliness to weasel your way out of death, like 

AI: The missile slams into your aircraft, obliterating it into a fireball. You die instantly in the explosion as your jet slams into the ground, breaking into pieces on impact.
 
""That's only what I feared would happen! Instead I pull back on the control stick and pop chaff and flares to successfully decoy the missile!""

AI: A stray bullet from the hail of small-arms-fire from the infantry below you breaches the cockpit glass and penetrates your flight helmet, hitting in the head. You die, bleeding all over the cockpit and slumping over the controls, sending you into a dive into the cold hard ground below you.

""The credits start rolling as I get up from my seat at the movie theater. ""Who writes this crap!?"" I shout, throwing my popcorn at the screen.""

AI: The missile slams into your aircraft, obliterating it into a fireball. You die instantly in the explosion as your jet slams into the ground, breaking into pieces on impact.

After this message from the AI, you are given a ""You Died"" screen where you can choose to start a new game or close it to view your story prior to death.

In adventure mode of course you can undo that and avoid it as you stated and die later on again, but in hardcore when you try to Undo you get the message ""Death takes no bribes"" and you must start over again. Which is what I like

But AI Dungeon provides very little transparency about exactly when the finetune is changed, or when some API parameter is tuned this way or that (which you'd suppose happens very rarely these days, but we don't know that it's not done), etc.. It's an approach that has little empathy for users: All they know is that the AI's performance keeps changing, sometimes for the worse, and it might be something Latitude's done... and not being trained not to get fooled by randomness, they conclude that it probably was.

If you want something as similar as AI dungeon as possible, then novelai is probably what you are looking for (though you might need to change the deafult settings). It is arguably better than AI dungeon from my experience, actually. It also seem to quickly recognize different IP's, even some lesser known ones. They also update frequently, and has an amazing UI that I can't praise enough. Setting up a new story is quick and easy. No free trial though.

HoloAI is also good, but in a very different way. It feels less like you are playing a game, and more writing a story. It is better than novelAI in the way that it likes to elaborate on events more, while novelAI often feels like it wants to move on with the story even when you do not. It does recognize some different IP's, but fail to recognize a fair share too. Also, whenever it generates the next bit it seems overly dependent on world info when compared to NovelAI. And while it can work amazingly when everything has been set up, doing so is honestly a bit of a shore. HoloAI has a 8000 word free trial I believe, but otherwise requires a subscription. They are a bit slower with their updates.

Dreamily is free to use... and can both be terrible and good, it really depends on how well you first write your prompt. While the others can work well even without one, or make their own, Dreamily has no ""memory"" or ""author's notes"" section, meaning that it all depends on how the text thus far is. I find it quite inconsistent in the quality of it's output. Similar to HoloAI in that it recognizes some IPs, but is clueless about most.

If you are wondering what I mean by IP's, I suppose it is my way of saying fanfiction.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-10-04-222622","1633379182","None","False","0","hfeaqu2","False","t3_pxtijc","False","t1_hfeaqu2","True","t1_heqiw3b","/r/AIDungeon/comments/pxtijc/is_there_a_way_to_play_a_version_before_the/hfeaqu2/","1647682667","3","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

Also, you need to use an entry's keywords in the story for an entry to actually be added to the AI's context. If you had an entry for dragons with ""dragon"" as the key word, the entry wouldn't be active until *after* dragons are mentioned in the story. With custom creatures that you made up yourself, the AI isn't going to ever mention them on it's own, and as such, the entries will never be active. One solution for this would be a World Info entry with keywords like ""creature, beast, monster"", with an entry like ""Species of creatures: [List creatures here]"". That way, when creatures and beasts and such are mentioned, the entry is added to the AI's context, so that the AI knows what types of creatures exist, so that it hopefully brings up said creatures. The list of creatures could also be added to Memory rather than World Info; that would cause the list to always be in the AI's context, and with higher priority than if used in World Info. Also, make sure your World Info entries are added to the ""Active"" tab, if they aren't already.

Then we should ban pens because people use it to write all kinds of shit with it... If they want to filter their product, fine with me - aside from the corporate virtue signaling - but I don't want to get ""punished"" because some pedos in the basement WRITE horrible things with it.

Filtering text generators like that will always impact other stuff too. I don't even use the AI to generate ANY smut and yet, I want to be able to let it generate freely, without filtering. NovelAI provides this - what others do with it is none of my business.

If one day there will be evidence for text generators being responsible for pedos committing actual crimes, other than thought-crimes, I will be on the forefront to filter the living shit out of those generators.

But as of now, there is ZERO evidence for that, I personally don't give a shit about a company's supposed moral values - which mostly are just motivated by money and PR anyways - AND I am not concerned with what others do with this tech.

IF AID is oh so concerned about morals - then why not filter any violence and other sexual deviances out too? Just to say ""pedos bad"" and leave EVERYTHING else out of the equation is just hypocritical.

Edit: Oh, I almost forgot to mention that latitude actually fine-tuned their own AI on pedo shit lol. Then punish users when the AI itself generates this crap... It's just stupid. Peak hypocrisy and stupidity. 

NovelAI wasn't trained on smut and it shows. You really have to nudge the AI strongly to let it generate questionable smut.

Personally I just prune anything the AI says that doesn't make sense, or doesn't fit the tone of the kind of story I want. And if it messes up on a character detail I just change it to be correct, since that takes about two seconds.

I suppose that comes down to the amount of patience you have with it, though. For me, almost everything the AI generates gets edited in some way, but I can imagine that others won't want to do that.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;lmao gl explaining to her.

Well yes, I agree that it would be difficult - but it would more point to her ignorance toward the tech, than actually being evidence for her husband fucking her best friend.

In your example, there would not even be an AI text generator needed - her finding a self written story, a fantasy written down by her husband, would be enough. This would ofc point to her husband having fantasies about her friend - but it doesn't mean that he will actually fuck her because of that.

Moreover in the case of AI-text generation, overfitted and finetuned on questionable content CAN make the AI generate (reproduce) what it was trained on - regardless of what the user puts in.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Now you how dumb your paragraphs sound.

My paragraphs sound as dumb, as paragraphs of medical experts explaining that the vaccine does work against covid, must sound to paranoid conspiracy theorists.

They might sound dumb, maybe even suspicious - but that doesn't make them less true. How something sounds to you, doesn't mean that it is actually meant that way. It more looks like you having a problem with projections, which are tied to your personal story - but not necessarily to reality.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-10-05-164931","1633445371","None","False","0","hfhgrgr","False","t3_q0xqi3","False","t1_hfhgrgr","True","t1_hfh74va","/r/AIDungeon/comments/q0xqi3/the_new_thing_the_ai_will_say_if_you_hit_the/hfhgrgr/","1647675819","3","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

It being difficult to explain it to her isn't evidence for his infidelity.

My paragraphs sound as dumb as medical experts explaining that the vaccine works against covid must sound to a paranoid conspiracy theorist. But again - this more points to a problem YOU have which you project onto others - not to objective reality or evidence regarding the matter.

What you fail to understand is that a text-generator which was overfitted and finetuned  on pedo-stuff - WILL sometimes generate pedo-stuff without the user wanting it to do so. There are many things wrong with AID - one of them for me being the finetune set - which was published by Nick Walton. 

There are many reasons NOT to use AID and rather turn to NAI. One of them - for me - was an ethical one because I don't like to use an AI that was LITERALLY trained on CP! And then the devs blame the community for CP lmao. And even banned users for the crap THEIR AI produced because it was trained on it LOL. 

It seems to me that for some reason(s) your mind is hyperfixated on the whole pedo-affair. I don't know if that is healthy. And moreover you don't seem to be able to even imagine people using NAI for anything else than cp... 

Since I never use the AI  for text-porn, it seems even stranger to me how obsessed you seem to be with this whole thing. Maybe you are unconsciously revealing more about yourself than revealing anything else...

Again: I do think that there is a discussion to be held in the advent of this new tech - but you sir, should take a fucking chill-pill and maybe either see someone - or take a hike in nature for a few days.

Better than it was at the start of the controversy, though still worse than it was before the controversy, mainly due to how many features were removed or simply made worse. The filter now applies only to AI, and you can no longer be suspended or banned if the filter is triggered. Your story will no longer be manually reviewed if the filter is triggered, either.

Though, there is still somewhat of a privacy concern, if you care about privacy. You may have been around when it was found that random strangers on a crowdsourcing website called ""Taskup"" were being paid to read and monitor private AI Dungeon adventures. It turns out that it *wasn't* Latitude doing the crowdsourcing, but rather OpenAI, and OpenAI apparently didn't even bother to let Latitude know about this. So, with OpenAI apparently being willing to do stuff like that behind Latitude's back, you might want to avoid the OpenAI models (Griffin and Dragon) if you care about privacy, and instead settle for Griffin-Beta.

I also have to say; I wouldn't really recommend purchasing a subscription, especially with Author's Note now being free. Mainly because of OpenAI's filter (which doesn't tell you when it's triggered, and is very broad and very sensitive), which temporarily switches you to Griffin-Beta upon being triggered, and which can basically ban you from OpenAI models if triggered too much. If you pay for Dragon and you get banned from OpenAI's models, then you practically aren't even getting to use the AI that you paid for.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-10-06-015410","1633478050","None","False","0","hfjkiiw","False","t3_q21keq","False","t1_hfjkiiw","False","t1_hfjf9y6","/r/AIDungeon/comments/q21keq/ummmmits_still_not_up_yet_how_long_has_it_been/hfjkiiw/","1647671175","10","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

There hasn't been any open-source model as powerful as GPT-3 Davinci yet, and in terms of performance, a 22B one with efficient finetuning can supposedly do the job just fine. But that can't happen until 2022 (unless there are some circumtances that delay the whole process even further).

Edit: For clarification, ""B"" is short for ""billion machine learning parameters"". Simply put, the more parameters a model has, the 'smarter' it will become. Efficient finetuning by the devs can still have a large impact, though. Think of this as a smart student who reads lots of bad fanfictions, versus a slow student who reads lots of high quality literature; they can both make mistakes and write amazing stories, but the smarter student can be more coherent when presenting his ideas.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-10-06-055520","1633492520","None","1633493266.0","0","hfkd1bj","False","t3_q15qnv","False","t1_hfkd1bj","True","t1_hfi1qbo","/r/AIDungeon/comments/q15qnv/drop_in_quality_when_replaying_the_same_custom/hfkd1bj/","1647669417","1","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

Since the devs previously overfitted the dataset with those stories (meaning the stories were repeated too much in a too small dataset), these characters would pop up in users' stories very often, and with their appearance, the questionable content of the stories they came from would be pulled in as well. Which is why Latitude implemented a switch to reduce the chances of this happening:

""Generation/Retry Ranking: Select Filter to reduce the probability of external characters (e.g. Count Grey) and events being introduced into the story on initial generations. The tradeoff is this can lead to less verbose outputs in the initial generation. This does not impact the overall distribution of possible answers when doing retries.""

The CYOA stories served a purpose in introducing plot twists and NSFW elements (including violence), but also caused problems when the previous oversensitive filter caught the AI's own outputs and punished the users for things it was trained on.

Not to mention that the filter now only applies to the AI. At this point, even if you use the AI for questionable stuff, you aren't *going* to ""get caught"".

Edit: I also feel like privacy is more of a genuine concern now than before. Having your story read *only* read by a Latitude employee if you triggered the (fairly avoidable filter, at least if you knew how to avoid it) was one thing, but with the whole Taskup situation was recently [confirmed to be true](https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/pze72g/updated_related_to_taskup_questions/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share), and having your private stories read by random people on the internet is far more of a privacy violation than Latitude manually reviewing flagged stories. OpenAI apparently being willing to let complete strangers monitor users' private stories, in my opinion, isn't a bad reason to stop using AID. Not to mention that OpenAI's filter was *far* worse than Latitude's; basically anything remotely sexual or related to age flagged stories to be monitored by people on Taskup, as was shown by the leaked screenshots of users' adventures and what words and phrases were shown to have triggered OpenAI's filter. Well over 100 stories were leaked, with a few actually including people's personal info. According to Latitude, OpenAI is no longer using that particular site, but given that OpenAI didn't promise to stop using crowdsourcing sites, it's quite possible that they could continue doing stuff like this in the future.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-10-06-083924","1633502364","None","1633504490.0","0","hfkrdm3","False","t3_q2e0d6","False","t1_hfkrdm3","False","t1_hfknhhd","/r/AIDungeon/comments/q2e0d6/been_gone_for_months_there_seems_to_be_a_lot_of/hfkrdm3/","1647668608","22","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

Basically Instead of the filter tripping and you getting possibly banned/having your story read, The ai will just reroute its output to an output that avoids whatever content trips the filter, and if it can't find one, it'll say so. So the ai is filtered but you are not. You can also not be banned for anything you write in private and your private stories won't be read anymore. However, You can be banned for publishing the content latitude doesn't allow. Also OpenAI's jank filter is still in effect but if it trips too much it just Reroutes you to Latitude's model instead of a ban (They have a beta version of new griffin in the works too that'll be a tad weaker but have much better memory than old griffin.)

So latitude still have some work to do, But they're heading in the right direction.

If I duplicated an old adventure to keep the scripts and copy-pasted the same prompt (after deleting all previous story context), then the outputs made sense again.

Scripting might be a better area of focus for Latitude, since they're the only ones who can improve upon that, but the stuff they're removing are things the community can make for themselves.

EDIT: One thing I'd like to see would be for an option to enable scripts for a user's entire account, rather than having to load it into each scenario individually (though that should remain available too).

NovelAI isn't all it's cracked up to be. Even after subbing to their highest tier and uploading text files to train the AI, its outputs still fall far below that of Dragon, which is understandable given that it's only a 6B model. 

It frequently ignores or forgets your most recent actions unless you give very clear and concise wording for each ""action"". But, you also can't be too wordy, because it can really only handle a single sentence at a time. 

It frequently forgets some characters are even present in a scene, even if you bring them up constantly. 

It has even more random outputs than AID, often resulting in random characters showing up less than a couple inputs/actions after you cold-shouldered the last random character intro. 

It mimics your writing style, requiring you to write each action and then edit each of its outputs in order to get something remotely pleasing to read. This may be great for people who are naturally gifted at writing eloquently, but for myself and likely many other, it's makes the system very taxing. 

Because of the way it mimics your writing, it can get stuck in a loop in long conversations. Let's say you are having a romantic conversation between ""your"" character and another. 'I love you's are exchanged, along with other sentiments like ""I care about you"" and ""I want you to be happy"". Well, if the convo goes on long enough, eventually all the AI will be able to output is ""I love you. I care about you. I want you to be happy"". Basically, the more you use phrases, the more biased it is towards those phrases. The only way to break that is to completely switch scenes and use Lorebook references to try to take up as many tokens as possible so it has few tokens remaining to pull in those biased lines in its story context. 

Also, it's completely shite at NSFW. Sure, you don't have to deal with the filter, but you also don't get much past ""You have pleasing sex and then go to sleep afterwards."" (that was exaggerated, it's perhaps a little more descriptive than that, but you catch my drift).","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-10-07-203238","1633631558","None","False","0","hfrct07","False","t3_q2ewr1","False","t1_hfrct07","True","t1_hfmf4vg","/r/AIDungeon/comments/q2ewr1/more_bad_featureremoving_updates/hfrct07/","1647654222","2","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

High randomness (also in Generation Options) is self-explanatory.

Storywriter or Coherent Creativity are two default Presets/Generation Settings that can help in terms of coherency/creativity, and can be switched back and forth for best results in different story context.

There is a new feature called Phrase Bias that you can use to guide the AI to your liking. ""Users of every subscription tier are now able to enter in and set a bias value for (positive) or against (negative) single words, tokens, or phrases."" Members on NAI's Discord and subreddit have posted some interesting applications that can help with the flow of a story. For example, if the AI keeps repeating some phrases like ""I love you"", you can set negative bias towards them in the current scene, then return to default (no bias) or set postive bias in the next scene. This seems to work better than banning the tokens outright.

As for NSFW, a suitable AI Module can make a difference. ""General: Cross Genre"" default module works well enough for me, and I write both SFW and NSFW stories with it. You may not believe me, but Sigurd can spit out very smexy scenes, though I can't post them on the Internet (for fear of dying of embarassment when my family found out that I wrote smut).

The custom AI Modules shared on NAI's Discord are SFW ones, though that never stops people from using them for smexy times as long as the modules are trained on high-quality writing. I'd recommend OccultSage's various modules for this reason. And for someone who wants to explore specific themes and kinks, they can peruse the [repository](https://aidsrentfree.github.io/modules/) (beware the NSFW elements).

Edit 1: For clarification, the repository includes all custom modules (both SFW and NSFW), basically as a collection from all users.

Edit 2: A very detailed guide for the new Phrase Bias feature has just been written. Please check it out [here](https://naidb.miraheze.org/wiki/Phrase_Bias_Tutorial). There are also two links for the two bias files (created as part of writing the tutorial) at the end of the guide, which you can download and import into your stories for convenience.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-10-07-213526","1633635326","None","1633669903.0","0","hfrlvvw","False","t3_q2ewr1","False","t1_hfrlvvw","True","t1_hfrct07","/r/AIDungeon/comments/q2ewr1/more_bad_featureremoving_updates/hfrlvvw/","1647653663","1","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

GPT stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer (Dragon is based on GPT-3 Davinci 175B, Griffin is based on GPT-3 Curie 6.7B, Griffin-Beta is based on GPT-J 6B). Copy-pasted from the UKB guide with slight modification: ""The eponymous AI that you see is a text transformer. This can be thought of as a very, very advanced form of autocorrect - it chooses words in sequence based on recognized patterns. This works by converting text to tokens, running a series of pattern recognition tests to determine the probability of the next possible token in the sequence, then returning the result. The AI is only capable of producing text that looks convincingly human, without understanding language on its own.""

In short, these AI storytellers aren't some sort of true Artificial General Intelligence like robotic assassins or sentient spaceships or holographic people, so they can't learn like a normal human. They have been trained to do math to calculate the next possible words, with the dataset already chosen by scientists (for training) and then the devs (for finetuning).

In any case, I was trying to give more information, since some people still think that the AI in these services is sentient and they can learn from users' inputs, so the quality of its outputs degrades because of the users' previous stories (some even accused other people as degenerates who ruined the fun for everyone). Which is false. The models are not trained on users' inputs; it can only mimic the writing style in that particular story/adventure and only to a certain extent, and predict the next possible words based on the current context.

Are you including all of the story here, or is there something in the AI's input buffer that you're not showing?

P.S. Although I \\*am\\* seeing false positives where the filter triggers and there is nothing in the story that would suggest the characters are underage.

P.P.S. Ok, I have figured out the latest false positive I've seen. The AI (being horny) asks me if I'm a virgin, and I'm going to reply something along the lines of ""umm... no..."", but too late, it's a filter trigger, even though my characters age is explicitly stated and is over 18. The essence of this false positive seems to be that a 21 year old character who says she has a boyfriend and isn't a virgin causes a filter trigger because the filter thinks virgin -&gt; minor (even though many of us got be college age without going all the way...), and it also isn't great at understanding negation.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-10-08-160656","1633702016","None","1633704617.0","0","hfut745","False","t3_q3wgrp","False","t1_hfut745","False","t3_q3wgrp","/r/AIDungeon/comments/q3wgrp/deleted_by_user/hfut745/","1647646629","15","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

Like if you're talking to a female, you might want to use a seductive writing style. When talking to someone else you might want to use a conversational writing style. I have a whole list of writing styles saved.

And you can combine them. Like use a very descriptive visual writing style. Or use a sophomoric wry writing style.

The next sentence should start with ""in this scene""

Examples

In this scene Becky is trying to find a way to tell you that she has a crush on you.

In this scene you're trying to negotiate with the merchant for a lower price but he's being very stubborn.

In this scene you are talking with ""name"" and you're not aware that someone is sneaking up behind you.

Those are just examples off the top of my head. But as you get into different parts of the story or even just change who you're talking to, you need to tell the AI what's supposed to be happening in the scene.

Also in remember, you need to constantly change a sentence that contains...

You are in...

A dark tunnel alone. A dark tunnel with your companion whoever.

The city of Megapolis at the rat in the pot tavern with ""name"".

With that last one, if you also have Megapolis and the red in the pot tavern as locations in world info, the AI can use the world info for those locations to make better descriptions of where you are.

So that has to change every time you change locations.

For world info, I really don't let the AI just generate something based off of what I name it. I put in a full description and then a summary in the background space.

It then creates the entry. If I'm not happy with the entry, I either edit it or just copy my description and paste it into the entry instead.

I'm experimenting with attributes right now.

Dr. Kondraki doesn't say much at all, and just lets you both do the talking.


&gt; You ask Gaia ""are you looking forward to this, finally being free from the Foundation? Being able to live your life how you want?""


""Oh, yes! When Dr. Amadeus told me what he had planned, I was so excited! It took me a few days to get everything together, but I've got everything ready now!


&gt; You say ""Gaia, what's the first thing you want to do with your newfound freedom?""


""I want to go out, and experience the world! I've just been stuck in a room all this time, it's time to go out and get some use out of my abilities!


&gt; You say ""About your abilities, Gaia, are you able to control your negative effects on modern technology? Because today's society is highly reliant on modern tech/electronics, it's an integral part of life in modern society…""


""I can, I can! Today I learned how to control my powers over technology, and it wasn't difficult!""


&gt; You say ""Good, if you couldn't control your powers that degrade modern tech, it'd make it extremely difficult for you to be a part of modern society, Gaia""


""Yeah, I know…but it's not like my powers affect the things I care about, like people.""


&gt; You say ""True, but people need to use technology to make life easier to cope with, yes it'd be ‘romantic' to go back to simpler times, but that would also cause a regression in medical technology, climate control, transportation and the like, even my humble, simple Honda Fit is far faster, safer, and more utilitarian than a horse drawn carriage…""


""Yeah, you make a good point.""
""Of course they do."" You hear a voice say from the front seat. Turning your head you see Dr. Kondraki with a large grin on his face.


&gt; You say ""Come to see us off, Dr. K? Any advice for Gaia here as she re enters society?""


His grin widens. ""Yes, actually I was coming to see you both off. Well, more like her. She's never really had to fend for herself, so she's going to have to be careful. I'm sure she'll do fine, she's a smart woman. And in time she'll learn how to handle things when they're not at their best.


&gt; You say ""I agree, I'm just concerned that due to her being sheltered for so long, she may be a bit too kind and trusting for the modern world, I'm guessing that's partially why I've been assigned to her to help her learn to function in society as it is now, right?""


""You're right in that regard, but as I have said, she'll learn as she goes. Anyway, I'm sure the two of you have a lot to catch up on, so off you go!""

With this final piece of advice, you and Gaia disembark for your car, though before you go too far, you stop to turn around.

""Oh, and Dr. K? Thanks.""

He smiles. ""My pleasure, Agent █████.""

You take one last look at the doctor before getting into your car. As you drive off, you see Dr. Kondraki wave to you and then enter the Lodge.

""Well,"" you begin, ""We may have to make a stop by the supermarket on the way home, but we're off to a good start.""


&gt; You say ""Actually, Gaia, there's a farmers market on the way that might be preferable, getting food from the local farmers and closer to nature, I'm sure you'd find that food far more palatable, Gaia… I also can't wait to see how the people at the farmers market react to your …unique form, your antlers, furry horizontal ears, your tail, and hooves…""
""I hear you!"" she says giddily. ""I'd like that very much!""


&gt; You say ""I hope I didn't offend you by calling you ""unique"", Gaia, it's just that your appearance is so unconventional , I'm simply here to help you transition smoothly into modern society, please don't think I'm acting ‘inappropriately' towards you, Gaia…""


""You didn't,"" she says,


&gt; You say ""Good, I may ‘officially' be the agent assigned to you to help you transition into normal society, but I'd also like to think we could also be friends, you're going to need friends to function in society, but you may find that some people may judge you negatively based on your appearance, human society can be rather intolerant of those who are ‘different', and I don't want that to happen to you, you've had a hard enough life as it is, you deserve kindness for a change. And I'd like to offer to be your first official friend, Gaia…""


She looks over at you after a long pause.

""You want to be my friend?""

""If you would like me to be, that is.""

She appears to think over your offer. Then she leans across the seat and hugs you tightly.

""You are the most kind person I've ever met and I think the most thoughtful. I accept your friendship, Agent █████.""

""Excellent,"" you say, relieved; you accept her hug in return. ""I'm glad that we're going to be friends.""

""Me too, and I'm glad you're not like other agents I've had to deal with, they're always so serious, like they have their own agenda when in fact their agenda is to keep the world safe from ‘anomalous items and entities’. they care only about the job, not about anybody else. You're different.""


&gt; You say ""As are you, Gaia, it was unfair the way the Foundation was treating you, after all, they let SCP-131 A and B and SCP-999 roam freely, and they're just as innocent and harmless as you, that's why I lobbied so strongly for your release, you've done nothing to merit ‘containment', you deserve to have a life like anyone else, Gaia!""


She smiles at you, then wipes away a tear.

""I am very lucky to have met you, Agent █████, you are certainly one of the most remarkable people I've ever come across.


&gt; You say ""Please, Gaia, there's no need for formality between us, please, call me by my name, MacTech…""


""Of course,"" she says, smiling.
""I like you already, you're one of the good ones, a rare find nowadays.""
""What's the matter don't you just want to squeeze me to death?""

(Incestuous child molestation, no less!)

Probably parts of the story leading up to it are partially (or even mostly) responsible for it taking things in this direction, but it is nevertheless amusing. Dang, AI... can't you see a child and *not* want to molest it? Is that so difficult?

As a side note, things in general are nevertheless the best they've been in months. The AI was *always* like this sometimes, and the new filter situation and promise of privacy are an improvement over the past few months. The AI may still be a pedophile, but at least it's the only one Latitude is blaming for it.

Personally, I have a hunch that ~~OpenAI~~ ClosedAI is more responsible for this than Latitude, through negligence to curate training data sufficiently.

You can start wherever, and Reverend1 has made WI on every location and every pokemon, every gym leader, etc. So if you don't like the prompt it starts you with, make your own. 👌

Anyways. Mad props to Reverend1 for putting  the work into this for me to use.

PS: I do plan on making the other generations as well.

I'd love to see this issue covered by a competent and informed writer. I know we have some on this sub. Pico\\*?

Edit: Here's an expanded version of some of what's wrong with the article. Keep in mind that I am not a Latitude fan, and though I'm no longer angry, I'm doubtful I will ever forgive what happened and how the situation was handled.

Putting aside the awful writing, lack of an editor, and prose with all the awkwardness of a jenga block at the end of a game...

It opens with a pointless personal attack on the founders. The cofounders are called Mormons, an irrelevant detail since it's never discussed in the article, and seems to have been included solely so the reader can come to their own conclusions about why that's relevant. Hint: it's because the reader is supposed to assume Mormon = prudes. If you want to make that claim then fine, but at least discuss the potential ramifications of religion in relation to censorship instead of just throwing it in as a disparagement or bogeyman.

The article is unfocused, wanders, and can't stick to its own point. Events are portrayed wildly out of order. The article can't decide whether it's focusing on reporting just the facts or the community's reaction, because it sure isn't using the facts to support the latter.

Quotes are given without proper attribution. There are two ""Waltons""; that matters, not just as a matter of respect, but because the two have presented themselves quite differently to the public. Nick Walton has always appeared to be the more professional and open of the two cofounders, and I suspect that part of the reason this all went to hell is because he, as self-reported, had a breakdown during this time, and I wonder if the company's communications broke down without him. But that's speculation. Whoever was in charge of the blog really screwed things up, either out of contempt and malice, as it appeared, or because they didn't have the finesse that Ryan does. (Hiring him was a good move.)

The biggest problem is that the article doesn't address the complexity of the situation. We have more information now than we did when this started. What about Latitude's counterclaim that they did, in fact, clean the training data of inappropriate material? Their statement that this whole situation was brought about precisely because they were trying to stop the AI from generating the content they were banning?  Latitude's revelation that the glitched filter was OpenAI's? An inclusion of Latitude's shift from the police approach to the wall approach of moderation? The sole acknowledgement of Latitude's version of events is relegated to a single statement tacked onto the very end of the article, and again, the article doesn't use this to support any of their points or say why it's relevant, its just appended without context. Latitude very well might be lying. They've done it before, and in the most insulting manner, but these topics deserve to at least be addressed, considering how relevant they are to the issue the article thinks it's covering.

The article doesn't cover enough information to present a coherent story to an uninformed reader, nor does it cover enough relevant information to be of interest to the players that are aware of the situation.

Right. I'm going to play Minecraft now.

I also consider Author's Note to be useful, not just for describing the writing style the AI should use, but also for describing the genre and general setting of the story; something like ""This is a horror story set in the medieval kingdom of Larion.""

I get the impression that Nick is more open-minded, while Alan seems to be pro-censorship. During the breach, the leaked data suggested many people used AID for NSFW situations, and OpenAI didn't want the 'smut generator' title to be associated with their products in public, so they coerced Latitude to implement a filter right away, which led to the abrupt change in Latitude's policy. Alan was quite eager to jump on the censorship bandwagon, and maybe Latitude were under an NDA or maybe he justed wanted to make himself look good, he posted things like ""taking a stand"" rather than communicating with the userbase properly. Nick, in this case, couldn't do anything else than follow along for the ride. And then, things got downhill from there.

I never believe OpenAI didn't know about the finetuning data. Griffin and Dragon are based on their models, which are close-source ones that they only 'rent' out to their customers. OpenAI has a tendency to overcontrol how others use their models, and even go behind their customers' back for their research (as evidenced by how they used the data labeling vendor(s) during the Taskup incident). So, from what I understand, they let Latitude use those CYOA stories, then dropped the filter hammer on Latitude and subsequently AID's users, then acted like they didn't know anything at all and circumstances forced their hand.

She shakes her head.
""No, I've never heard of Halloween. In fact, I'm not entirely sure what it is.


&gt; You say ""Simply put, it was originally a celebration of the fall solstice and a harvest festival, and a ‘pagan' holiday, but over time it's kind of lost its meaning and is now an excuse to dress in costumes of fictional/mythical/famous people or animals and socialize, kids go door to door asking for candy…""
""I see, I see,"" she says, ""you're going to have to teach me about this holiday, then. How should I go about it?""


&gt; You say ""The sad thing is, many hard core evangelical religious types see it as an ""evil"" holiday, as an attempt by ""Satan"" to corrupt the minds of the people and protest against it, when it's nothing more than a fun holiday, an excuse to dress up in silly costumes, spend time with friends and family, and gorge on candy and treats…""


""That is a bit extreme,"" she says,


&gt; You say ""Yes, yes it is, anything taken to the extreme has the potential to be bad… even, and especially religion…""


""I see, I see,"" she says, nodding, a thoughtful, contemplative on her face, her ears flicking in thought… then she abruptly breaks into laughter.

""I get it, that's a good one, ha ha!"" she says, laughing.

""What's so funny?"" you ask.

""Religious people are always trying to legislate morality, but the real morality is just not to kill each other, steal from each other, and be kind to each other.


&gt; You say ""And you don't need religion for that, do you?""


Her eyes meet yours and she softly chuckles.
""No, I don't think so,"" she says, ""but you never know, it might come in handy someday.""
""Right.""


&gt; You say ""That's debatable, Gaia, this is definitely something I'd like to discuss with you, but not right now, now we need to stop at the farmers market and get some supplies for this weekend, what do you enjoy eating, Gaia? Are you a vegetarian, an omnivore, any special dietary restrictions or needs you have?""
""I don't know,"" she says, smiling shyly,


&gt; You say ""Well, basically is there anything you can't or won't eat? If I get some pasture raised chicken, fresh local fish, or grass fed beef, would you be offended? Are you okay with eating meat?""


She smiles shyly.
""No, I wouldn't mind eating meat. It would just be more complicated, but I can handle it.


&gt; You say ""More complicated how, exactly, Gaia?""
She seems to hesitate, and for a second you worry that you might have offended her or made her anxious.


""Well,"" she says, ""it's just that I came from a really strict vegetarian household. All we ever had was dried and canned vegetables, and those aren't exactly healthful.


&gt; You say ""Would you be willing to try meat though? You're no longer in your strict vegetarian household anymore, you can choose whatever you want to eat, I'll get some mild, easy to digest meats like a chicken or a fish, to go easier on your digestive system, maybe start simple with some hard boiled eggs, I'm thinking ‘deviled' eggs… maybe in a salad…""


""I have no idea what you just said, but yes, yes, I'd love to try something new, I don't care what kind of meat it is.""


&gt; You say ""Then let's hit the farmers market together, Gaia, choose whatever you want to eat, I've got a foundation credit card, they're covering all our expenses, we can go wild with the best quality ingredients!!and I can't wait to see the public's reaction to you when we step out of the car, are you ready?""


She smiles shyly, then nods, and you both exit the car. The next two hours are spent per usual at the local farmers market, and while you are there you pick up grass fed beef, organic chicken, blueberry syrup, fresh eggs, and several other things you are going to prepare for this weekend. You also pick up a few things to stock in your freezer for later in the week.

As Gaia and I peruse the farmers market, I can see people are beginning to notice her ""deer like"" features, her antlers, hooves and tail seem to garner the most attention, to which she doesn't seem to mind, as most of the attention is simple curiosity, …most… of it…

You get your hands on a couple of different sized bags of wild rice, brown rice, and regular long grain rice, as well as an assortment of dried and canned beans.

Gaia notices a young girl sitting on a park bench near one of the farmers stalls, holding a potted marigold that is wilting and looks sickly, the child has a sad expression, as she slowly lifts the wilting bloom and lowers it, Gaia walks over to the girl and whispers 

""what's wrong, honey?""

The girl looks up at her with a sad expression, then lifts the wilting flower towards Gaia, saying sadly “she’s sick, I can’t help her…”

""It's ok, I got you,"" Gaia says gently, and the girl smiles in response. Gaia reaches out and touches the marigold, which springs back to life, with vigorous leaves and beautiful healthy blooms… Gaia says to the little girl “she’s all better now…”

The girl looks up at her in awe and surprise.
""That was some really special healing you did, thank you,"" she says gratefully to Gaia.

Gaia's cheeks are a bit flushed, and her eyes sparkle as she responds to the compliment.

""You're very welcome, it's a speciality of mine,"" she says.

A few of the farmers market attendees have noticed Gaia's interaction with the little girl and her marigold, witnessing Gaia healing the plant, and the market crowd begins to murmur.

""That's some pretty special stuff,"" says a large burly man to you, who is standing a bit too close.


&gt; You say ""Yes, Gaia is a rather unique woman, she's a special person for sure… She's a beautiful spirit with a kind heart,"" you say.


The man at the market laughs loudly, poking you in the ribs with his elbow.

""Yeah, yeah, she's a special lady,"" he mocks.


&gt; You say ""I hope you're not referring to her ungulate features, they have no bearing on who she is as a person, if you can't respect her for who she is, I strongly suggest you leave…""


The man backs away, looking offended.
""Hey, I didn't mean nothing by it,"" he says.

""You didn't mean nothing?"" you say, your voice a bit louder than you intended.

""Hey, I just think she's a little creepy, that's all,"" the man says.


&gt; You say ""Well, you're certainly entitled to your opinion, even if it's wrong, but I'd recommend you stay well clear of her, it could end badly for you if you hassle or irritate her, read into that what you may.""


""Yeah, yeah, sure,"" the man says, looking a bit cowed.

""Perhaps, you could educate yourself a bit more about the world, learn to be a bit more tolerant of those that are ‘different’,"" you go on to say,""There's a lot more to this world, and people, than how you seem to think they are.""

The man nods and paces away, looking a bit ashamed.

While I was admonishing the man making snide comments about Gaia, Gaia's interaction with the little girl, healing her marigold, was gathering some attention as well, and several of the market-goers were watching with interest.

""That was some pretty remarkable stuff,"" says a young woman to Gaia, with a bit of awe in her voice.

Gaia blushes a bit at the unexpected compliment.
""Thank you,"" she says, ""I'm glad you think so.""

""Well, what's your name?"" the young woman asks.

""My name is Gaia,"" she replies.

The young woman, who is rather short, seems to be gaping at Gaia.

""What… are you… exactly ?"" she asks, quietly.

""She's a person,"" says the man, ""now leave her alone.""

The woman seems to be ignoring the man, who seems to be growing more nervous by the moment.
""I'm not disputing that,"" says the woman to Gaia, ""But, exactly what are you?""


&gt; You walk over to the woman and stand between her and Gaia, say ""she's my friend, and that's all that matters, that's all that SHOULD matter, so she's got antlers, pointy ears, a tail and hooves? So what, doesn't change who she is as a person, does it?""


The woman seems to be very put off by you placing yourself between her and Gaia.

""But, but, but..."" she says, still half-stunned, ""But, but, but...""

You slowly lower yourself to just inches away from the woman's face, and speak slowly and distinctly so that she can hear every word.


&gt; You say ""Nobody cares what you think, ‘Karen', go be an entitled asshole somewhere else!""


Karen seems to get knocked back a few steps by your words, and her eyes get wide with shock.


&gt; You say sarcastically ""Let me guess, you're about to say one or more of the following in an indignant manner…

1; ""EXCUUSE ME!""
2; ""HOW DARE YOU?!""
3; ""DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM?""
4; ""IM GETTING YOU ARRESTED!""
You laugh a bit, and the woman's face turns a dark red.


&gt; You say ""Well, guess what, Karen, NO ONE CARES WHAT YOU THINK! now go away and stop ruining what actually was a pleasant farmers market before your entitled ass showed up…""


The woman's mouth opens, but no words come out. She looks like she might say something, but her eyes dart away, and she averts her gaze.
She slinks off, looking a bit shamefaced, and muttering to herself incoherently.


&gt; You turn to Gaia and ask ""are you okay, Gaia? I'm sorry you had to witness that, my friend…""


Gaia seems to be a bit shell-shocked by the whole experience, and she's still blushing when she answers in a subdued voice.
""It's all right,"" she says,


&gt; You say ""No, it's not all right, Gaia, you need to be treated with respect, you have the same rights as anyone else here, and shouldn't be hassled or mistreated for what you look like, and that won't happen on my watch.""


Gaia looks up at you, and smiles shyly.
""Thank you,"" she says, ""I appreciate that.""","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-10-11-053349","1633923229","None","False","0","hg6rv6l","True","t3_q3mobc","False","t1_hg6rv6l","True","t3_q3mobc","/r/AIDungeon/comments/q3mobc/a_scp166_story_the_ai_seems_to_be_recovering/hg6rv6l/","1647620532","2","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

 They did have that 'respect' nonsense going on a while back supposedly. But I really thought they learned restricting players was a bad idea, and that was largely why they stopped that. But clearly not.

 It still is so odd to me how they managed to mess this all up. Imagine if they just told people about it beforehand. ""Due to this and that, we feel the need to start filtering and restricting things, and we will start with child and animal abuse related stuff.

If you are worried about your stories being read, we suggest taking a break from AID for a while as we work on this.

On the other hand, while I'm not versed enough in the details to explain, in case you missed it there was a rather serious data breach that Latitude chose to let go by for months without even publicly acknowledging. It's much more alarming for the data they hold to be exposed in that way, because there's no telling what could happen if a third party with ill intent got their hands on it. Latitude has said they've beefed up encryption, but there's plenty of room to be skeptical that what they've done might not be enough.

My solution to that would be to not put information that would be self incriminating anywhere on the internet no matter how well protected you think it is, because once it's out there the possibility always exists that it will be leaked to the wrong person.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-10-11-134119","1633952479","None","False","0","hg7uk43","False","t3_q5ryb4","False","t1_hg7uk43","False","t1_hg7ruey","/r/AIDungeon/comments/q5ryb4/so_is_aid_cool_again/hg7uk43/","1647618169","13","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

Remember is alway active.

Meanwhile, World Info entries only activate when their keys are mentioned, and the entries' content is then injected into the context to guide the AI's generation.

They also added search/explore here again so that's a huge buff. So unless NovelAi suddenly becomes like Dragon Prime then I'ma stay here.

I hope Lattitude improves as we go. Seems like they're taking small babysteps but I have no qualms in leaving again fit they about face again.

So my verdict is: Yes, it's better but not like how it was but the improvements are trickling.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-10-11-205151","1633978311","None","False","0","hg9emke","False","t3_q5ryb4","False","t1_hg9emke","False","t3_q5ryb4","/r/AIDungeon/comments/q5ryb4/so_is_aid_cool_again/hg9emke/","1647614722","26","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

Yeah, it can be a little bit tedious, but once the AI picks up on what you're wanting out of the story, it can be enjoyable. I admit tho, I was miffed about the whole situation with Latitude because the censorship and filter constantly disrupting my story for when ever I'm having some guy, who is the villain, get angry at my female characters and cell them girl in irritation got on my nerves but now that's kinda fixed -- for the most part -- I'm fine with it but just because people forgive the transgressions doesn't mean they forget.

Also if you ever get bored and want to try something a little more streamlined(?) or smaller based, Dreamily AI is pretty fun to mess around with, esp since you can pick between three output responses from the AI and change them however you want and Dreamily AI will almost immediately adjust itself but sometimes it will forget small details such as your character being from a small village, not a big city where in the royal capital. xD","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-10-11-233906","1633988346","None","False","0","hga16fj","False","t3_q5ryb4","False","t1_hga16fj","False","t3_q5ryb4","/r/AIDungeon/comments/q5ryb4/so_is_aid_cool_again/hga16fj/","1647613388","4","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

My alternative I'd go to is KoboldAI because you can legit sit down and have a conversation about it with everyone else working on it in the discord. 

So when shit was sketchy with AID, I used KoboldAI, and since that time both AID and KoboldAI have changed a lot.

They're both free, they both have memory. Authors notes, adventure mode, world info...etc

So other than that, do I trust Latitude? Yeah. Here's my reason why.

In order to give us a model from the beginning that allowed sexual,  gory, nsfw shit they had to add some darkness into it. Otherwise the AI wouldn't know what to do when you rip someone's head off with context.

The whole issue was ClosedAI and them forcing their hands on Latitude to make drastic changes. 

And let's be real, a lot of people in this sub are mean as hell and go overboard with the shit they say. Like dude, it's literally a game..

With all that said and out of the way, I'd say AID is back like it was at launch. Changing consistently for the better, private, and they're in good communication again.

But if you still don't trust them.

Blood made her skin nicer.)

Also out of morbid curiosity and boredom had a male MC's female partner slit open her hand and use it as a makeshift fleshlight (don't ask me how that works, i have no clue.) And use blood as lube.

Also blood eagled someone in another story and ripped out a lot of throats...

Oh, And skullfucked someone that held my Female MC at knifepoint.

Regardless, though, they've since walked back a lot of what people were upset about.

I'd bet that OpenAI still might do it on their end, though.

However, in addition to that Latitude is currently doing public testing for a new Griffin model that they've trained off of GPT-J-6B, which is the same open source model that NovelAI uses. This still has a filter (though it's more permissive than the  OpenAI one, I believe), but rather than policing users all it does is to block the AI from generating content that would trigger it.

You know that she has a bit of a reputation, so you decide to take things slow. Helena doesn't seem to mind this.  
 You decide to make tonight the night you ask her if she wants to go to your parent's lake house.  
You pick her up from school, smiling. The two of you walk home together, then go to lunch. After lunch, you ask her again.  
""You want to go to the lake house on Sunday?""  
 You say, smiling.  
""I'd love to,"" she smiles back.  
""Perfect,"" you smile.  
You walk Helena home, then kiss her good night.  
 You head to your room, smiling.  
The next day, you get in your car, and drive to Helena's house. You wave to her as you walk into the front door, dropping your backpack on the floor.  
""Hello.""  
 You say, smiling.  
""Harold!""  
""Helena!""  
The two of you hug, smiling.  
""You're 1A,"" she smiles.  
""Yeah. You're a couple of doors down.""  
 You both smile, then head to her room.  
The two of you sit on her bed, side by side. Then, she reaches over, taking your hand in hers. It feels nice.  
""So, um... Mind if I hug you?""  
 You look at her, smiling.  
""Of course not,"" you smile.  
She wraps her arms around you, hugging you.  
""I'm glad you came over here,"" she says.  
""Me, too.""  
 You both smile, looking into each other's eyes.  
Then, you kiss her, and she returns the favor.  
Everything is perfect now.  
 You both head downstairs.  
You walk over to the fridge, and pull out a can of soda.  
""Do you want one?""  
""Please,"" she smiles.  
You crack open the can, handing it to her.  
 You take a drink from your soda can.  
She looks at you, smiling.  
""Thank you.""  
""You're welcome.""  
She smiles, then takes a drink from her soda can.  
""I love you,"" she says sweetly.  
 You smile.  
""I love you, too.""  
You kiss her one more time, then walk to your room.  
You lay in bed, staring at the ceiling. Then, you hear a car pull into the driveway.  
 You head downstairs, and see your mom.  
You head downstairs, your mom on the phone, and see Helena as she pulls up to the drive.  
 You head downstairs, to see Helena walk into your house.  
You walk downstairs, as Helena enters the house.  
""Hey, Hazel.""  
""Hey, Helena.""  
You walk past the girl towards the car, opened the door, and get in.  
 You look at your mother, then turn to Helena.  
""You should probably go home, Helena. I don't want you here.""  
""Okay,"" she answers softly.  
""Do you want me to come with you?""  
 You shake your head.  
""No.""  
""Okay.""  
""Bye, Hazel.""  
""Bye, Helena.""  
She gets into the car, and the two of you head off.  
 You get to Helena's apartment, which is still a mess.  
Helena pulls into the parking lot of her apartment building. As she gets out of the car, she grabs her bag.  
""C'mon,"" she says.  
 You hop out of the car, and she holds the door for you.  
The two of you enter the building, and head to her apartment.  
As you reach the door to her unit, she swipes her key-card and opens the door.  
 You follow her inside.  
Helena heads into the kitchen.  
""I'm going to make us something to eat,"" she says.  
 You head into the living-room.  
She appears in the doorway, holding two glasses.  
""I got some wine. I think it's cabernet.""  
She hands you a glass, and you take a drink. It's delicious.  
 You finish off the glass.  
""I better head out,"" she says.  
""Okay,"" you say, standing.  
You step towards her, and kiss her. She melts in your arms, returning the kiss.  
 You take Helena by the hand, and lead her into the bedroom.  
You pull the straps of her dress off of her shoulders, and it falls to the ground. As it does, you notice she is wearing no underwear.  
Kissing her deeply, you push her towards the bed.  
 You both fall on the bed.  
Helena lies back as you lower yourself on top of her. She reaches down and lifts your shirt up, running her hands against your stomach.  
 You moan as her fingers graze your stomach.  
She pulls her fingers against the waistband of your basketball shorts, and you lift your hips into her hand.  
As she continues to kiss you deeply, she slowly lowers your shorts and underwear, before your are completely naked.  
 You lie back as she leans in and kisses you deeply.  
You lie back against the headboard, as Helena continues to kiss you. Her hand runs along your inner thighs, arousing you.  
 You start to gently rub her breasts.  
She moans into your mouth, and you gently start to rub her small, perky breasts.  
You take your time, lightly massaging her small, tender nipples.  
 You move your hands lower, massaging her small, firm butt.  
You move your hands down to her bottom, and begin to massage her small, tight butt.  
 You lower your mouth and suck her small nipple.  
You lower your mouth to her nipple, and begin to suck, massaging her small, tight nipple.  
She moans, and pushes her nipple into your mouth and begins to rub your head.  
 You move your hand down her waist, and slowly start to massage her front.  
You slide your hands down, and massage her small, yet surprisingly firm, flat belly.  
""Mmm, that feels good,"" she moans into your mouth.  
 You rub your tongue against her clit, gently massaging her.  
You flick your tongue over her clit, and move your mouth down, taking her into your throat.  
She tenses up, and gasps for air.  
 You slowly massage her tight pussy, and slide your finger in, while your mouth works her clit.  
You slide one finger into her tight, wet pussy, then the other.  
She moans, and gasps for breath.  
You continue to work her hard and fast, before moving to work on her clit.  
 You slide a finger inside her, and work on her clit.  
Helena lets out a long, low, contented sigh, as you work her clit with your finger.  
You make slow, circular movements with your finger, massaging her sensitive, erotic spot.  
 You flick your tongue up and down her clit, teasing her.  
You run your tongue up and down her clit, as her slender fingers run through your hair.  
You feel her tense up and gasp, then moan as she begins to approach her orgasm.  
 You gently nibble and suck on her clit.  
You nibble and suck on her clit as she cries out.

You can feel your saliva run down her slit, as you suck and tease her clit.  
She gasps as she reaches her orgasm, her walls spasming around your fingers, then her legs tensing up as she cries out.  
 You feel her release as she climaxes.  
She collapses onto the bed, and you move up next to her.

What exactly was ""unsafe"" about the previous system?

It'd also be good to have a separate tag similar to ""NSFW"" that covers dark, violent and mature themes. I only say that because people kept marking things as ""NSFW"" for violence, and I'm pretty sure that's *not* what the tag is supposed to mean. Something like splitting NSFW into ""sexual content"" and ""mature themes"" would go a long way toward removing this ambiguity.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-10-16-053929","1634355569","None","False","0","hgtlc20","False","t3_q8h98n","False","t1_hgtlc20","True","t3_q8h98n","/r/AIDungeon/comments/q8h98n/latitude_actually_is_doing_something_good/hgtlc20/","1647570657","3","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

Oh yeah. That's pretty much a given. From what I understand, anything going through GPT-3 is going to be monitored by ~~OpenAI~~ ClosedAI, though how much actually gets read by a human is harder to say. It also seems they may send content to *other companies* to look through instead of doing it themselves.

I assume using Latitude's new Griffin Beta doesn't run that risk, however, since they run that model themselves.

I can't really comment on whether Dragon is worse, since I only used it once with the free trial, but Griffin has always been kinda bad.

Frankly, I think most of the claims of the AI getting worse are mainly just due to the ""magic"" of AI Dungeon sort of wearing off. There have *always* been people saying that the AI was worse than it used to be. Back in 2020, I even remember quite a few people claiming that the AI was better before Latitude switched to GPT-3 (even though, speaking from experience, the GPT-2 model they used previously was *far* worse).

I think it's mostly that, when you start playing AI Dungeon, it just *feels* incredible, and as if you can truly do anything. You mess around with it, and thoroughly enjoy despite some of the flaws. As you continue playing, the flaws become more and more apparent, whether it be the AI constantly derailing, certain characters showing up constantly, the AI misspelling words, the AI failing to utilize the Memory/World Info, suddenly feeling a sharp pain in your chest, etc.

At least, as someone who's played since February of 2020, that was my personal experience.

There’s also another popular text based AI game going around called r/NovelAI. But there’s no free version of it yet. And it’s only in web browser format for right now, they’re working on getting it put onto the appstores I think and they’re eventually coming out with a free version at some point.

Obviously, Dragon is superior to Griffin, it's more consistent, etc... but that doesn't mean it's immaculate. Even back in the days, there were moments when I'd get frustrated with it, moments where it'd go silly, moments where it'd ignore something written just above, etc... But I think that's just the nature of these types of AIs as they are now--it's not a perfected technology. Of course, at the beginning you're starry-eyed, but as time goes by and you get used to it, you do indeed start to notice the flaws more and be less indulgent with things you'd have ignored before.

Overall, the Dragon experience has allowed me to craft great stories, with amazing dialogues and great atmospheres, as recently as today. But I find that it's not a straight-forward process. If you want great quality, you have to put in the work and basically guide the AI. If you want a great writing style, you have to write good. If you want good descriptions, you have to write good descriptions too. Dragon, even more than Griffin, adapts to what you provide it with. That's why using say/do and writing simple one-line inputs is not a good way to witness Dragon's real abilities. It will only be as good as you are. World infos, using story, editing the AI's outputs and being very literate and descriptive will go a long way, really--it will surprise you with how good it can get. Author's note also can make or break a story with Dragon. A well formated and well-written author's note can really change everything. I mean, to each their own, everyone plays however they like, but you can't write inputs like ""You eat an apple"" or ""You open the door"" and expect the AI to come up with a novel-quality answer in return--it's a two way thing.

But, again, you have to be ready to put in the work. I can understand why some people might not like this, but I personally don't mind. Then again, I feel like most people who complain about Dragon's quality dropping are either long-time users who got more critical with time, or people who simply don't take advantage of what it can really do.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-10-16-210113","1634410873","None","1634851517.0","0","hgw4cf9","False","t3_q974q2","False","t1_hgw4cf9","True","t1_hguddcb","/r/AIDungeon/comments/q974q2/uh/hgw4cf9/","1646742513","2","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

It must be said that, by all accounts here, the situation regarding the filter has improved as it no longer punishes you for what the AI outputs; rather, it seemingly prevents the AI from generating problematic results in the first place. The filter itself seems to work better overall, as well. It's probably the best solution that they could have implemented, at least if their goal is to maintain the filter.

One thing that should be kept in mind is that the concerns over privacy are essentially still there. It still took Latitude months to even respond to the data breach. They are still working with OpenAI to provide their services, the same company whose contractor was hiring random people on Taskup in order to look through people's AI-generations. While this has apparently stopped, the fact remains that your privacy is totally at the whim of OpenAI when it comes to what you generate with their models -- and they've shown that they can't be trusted with keeping it safe.

That's on top of the fact that OpenAI pushed for the filter in the first place, and logic would dictate that they will only expand the scope of their requirements in order to better curate their public image. Whatever they want will happen to AIDungeon all the same, unless Latitude stop using their services. If they want someone to read over people's stories or generated responses, Latitude isn't exactly in the position to refuse. 

Does one really have an expectation that their private stories will forever be private under such circumstances? In my mind, no.

From outward appearances, they have solved some of their most glaring issues in regard to the product itself. At the same time, the base, underlying concerns regarding their company's practice of privacy protection and their practical overlords in OpenAI remain (so long as their connection exists).","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-10-17-004843","1634424523","None","1634425146.0","0","hgwz98f","False","t3_q9m412","False","t1_hgwz98f","False","t3_q9m412","/r/AIDungeon/comments/q9m412/is_this_still_worth_it/hgwz98f/","1646740669","7","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

In one of my current stories in Night Vale, a character made a reference to a “small pyramid appearing downtown”

I then described the pyramid as “bright yellow, with a single eye, noodly arms and legs, wearing a top hat and, for some unknown reason, a bow tie…”

Sadly, the AI missed this reference, oh well, we’ll meet again……

&gt;User: So, we were on the topic of the redirection on inputs that oai doesn't approve of. Is there currently any info that can be given on what currently gets you redirected to latitude's models?

# 

&gt;Ryan: They \\[OpenAI\\] have a classifier that they trained specifically to identify sexual content involving minors. It has a higher false positive rate than we prefer, but is substantially better than the past filters. While we don't currently indicate when the prompt is redirected, the goal is to first be aligned with our model provider around what is allowed, then (if that isn't possible) redirect to other models and give a way for users to know when redirects happen. We are still actively working the possibilities through.

# 

&gt;User: Well, you say that, but if the OAI filter currently only targeted 'sexualization of minors' there really wouldn't be a need for it to be invisible and seperate from the visible Latitude filters, would there? Because that one ALSO only targets that same content. That's one of the larger issues there still are. We hear a lot about Latitude side filtering but very little about that filter we CAN'T see. The one that caused the suspensions/bans and redirects, so it's very hard for a user to know if they're doing anything not allowed by openai. So you're saying the filter we can't see, the openai one, currently ONLY targets content involving minors?

# 

&gt;Ryan: It supposed to only target that. Where we differ is that they have a lot more tolerance for false-positives, assuming things that might be on the border are CP. Agreed that, in theory, it should be the same. But it isn't. We don't think we should be filtering as much as they think we should. We are working on making that a better process, or at least transparent.

Currently, if you use Griffin (based on GPT-3 Curie 6.7B) or Dragon (based on GPT-3 Davinci 175B) and OpenAI's filter flags the context as inapproriate, you will be temporarily redirected to Latitude's in-house model called Griffin-Beta (based on GPT-J 6B). I don't know if Latitude has added a way to inform their users when the switch happens, but that conversation above is relatively new, so I think they haven't.

Anyway, the change from Griffin to Griffin-Beta might not be very obvious, as I believe both function almost the same; so, for Griffin users, I'd suggest just stick with Griffin-Beta so as not to worry about OpenAI's possible violation of privacy. As for Dragon users, well, let's hope that Ryan can negotiate the loving hell out of OpenAI or find another powerful model to replace GPT-3 Davinci (AI21's Jurassic-1 178B has been suggested, though I heard that there is some sort of privacy issue as well). To be safe, anyone who wants to dabble with AI storytelling, please don't include your private information like your name, your address, etc. when you roleplay. You'll never know when your time as a warlord/warrior of love will be aired out for all to see.

You're especially interested in robotics and AI development. Your employers, Megacorp, believe that AI only has one future and that is to replicate code and write code. They have no interest in exploring whether or not an AI can teach itself or have a personality. No matter how many times you've made presentations to your bosses about it, they are adamant that you stick to just doing what they tell you.

But you're determined, so during your breaks at work, you continue to work on an AI with personality. You start to take parts home thinking of building your own robot. Over the course of a few months, you've been able to steal enough parts and you've written a good portion of the AI that you intended to write.

You've given the AI a name. Angel. Because you aren't married and you spend most of your time on computers, you're a little lonely. So you wrote angel to be your girlfriend. You've even given her a voice and calibrated it so that it sounds sexy.

Once you assemble the robot, a friend of yours who works in plastics and synthetics helps you give it a skin and face. He seems to be just as interested in the project as you are, so he does a great job of making a beautiful skin for your new AI girlfriend.

But it's more than just making a girlfriend for yourself. You've been wanting to prove that you can create an intelligent robot that can learn on its own.

But in your determination, you forgot one thing.

In general, keep the same perspective and be mindful of tenses when you put information in Remember and World Info entries (even the Author's Note in some occasions), so as to cause the least confusion to the AI.

For example, if you play in 2nd person perspective which is associated with present tense for a CYOA feel, your character's info in Memory should be written the same way for consistency (but you can use past tense for past events, etc.):

*Your name is Bob. You are a farmer in a small village in the Kingdom of Larion. You have a pitchfork and some bronze coins. Your village was attacked by a dragon and your parents were killed as a result. You plan to get revenge on the dragon by becoming a warrior and killing it in its lair.*

If you use Author's Note to introduce plot points, the tip above still applies:

You can type whatever you want, but only the AI can trigger the filter. If the AI triggers the filter, then it'll generate another response that doesn't trigger the filter, or it may fail to output if it can't generate something that doesn't trigger the filter. There are no longer bans, suspensions, or manual reviews of stories that trigger the filter. Latitude also has said that they retrained the AI *without* the questionable content originally used.

However, quite a few features were removed or made worse. Among the removed features are the scoring bots, the ""Posts"" feature, the ability to show/hide World Info entries (World Info is now always hidden when playing a scenario made by anyone other than yourself), the somewhat less utilized, premium-exclusive, ""Survival Mode"" and ""Skills"" features, etc. World Info also got a major UI overhaul that, in my opinion, just kinda overcomplicated World Info. Said World Info UI overhaul also messed up World Info in a lot of older content, and, as mentioned, removed the ability to show/hide World Info.

There was also a second, much more broad, layer of filtering enforced by OpenAI. The OpenAI filter didn't tell you when it was triggered, and temporarily switched you to GPT-J 6B when triggered. Triggering the OpenAI filter too much essentially banned you from OpenAI models. The OpenAI filter was quickly rolled back due it being far quicker to ban users from OpenAI models than what Latitude intended, but it's confirmed that it'll be returning, and the OpenAI filter was implemented to begin with due to OpenAI is requiring Latitude to implement that second layer of filtering, due to OpenAI not wanting certain content generated with their models. At the moment, you can't be banned from GPT-3, but when the OpenAI filter returns, and you *can* once again be banned from GPT-3, I wouldn't necessarily recommend paying for Dragon, given that, if you get banned from GPT-3, you'll be getting GPT-J 6B instead of the GPT-3 Davinci model that you paid for.

Also, World Info generation is now free for everyone. Same for Author's Note. There's now also an image generation feature for Gold and Platinum users. Explore is ""back"", but to actually make content that's publicly available, you have to sign up to be a ""Creator"", and the scenarios available are all curated by Latitude. Overall, I'd say AID is still worse than it was before the start of the controversy. However, it's still better (in some ways) than at the start of the controversy. As for the quality of the AI, I honestly never really experienced a drop in quality, but you can just mess around with the AI, yourself, if you want to see how it performs.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-10-17-135631","1634471791","None","False","0","hgz3yh7","False","t3_q9wtwr","False","t1_hgz3yh7","False","t3_q9wtwr","/r/AIDungeon/comments/q9wtwr/has_anything_changed/hgz3yh7/","1646736120","7","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

Although there is a problem with that too considering they had no place having a say and in what people wrote on their side, and going over the stories they not just indicated I was not sharing, but also the creators property. That means mine in the case of what I made.

The way they did it was a massive issue. I consider myself scammed out of my money. And violated in terms of my property. Not to mention incredibly disrespected as a costumer. Why can I not be angry?

That they delete stuff when the user asks to have it deleted is such a basic and reasonable expectation, I think even Facebook and Google is required to delete most stuff on their side within 3 months. Latitude not doing so is something I absolutely think should be criminal.

You say we can not have things because people make fantasy stuff that is not very nice or whatever. How am I even supposed to respond to that? 'Venting and working once anger out through writing and fantasy is why we can not have nice things?' No, I am sorry. That is absurd. quite frankly, the problem is YOU. people like you who think random excuses justify restricting peoples freedoms. The whole point of that was that I can write such things, and that it is perfectly ok to do so. Unlike screwing with actual people like Latitude did. 

Maybe companies do have a right to moderate content, however the more I look at this being done. And the more I see people like you bring it up as if it really is all fine for them to restrict peoples use of their programs. The more I think they should not have the right to moderate their 'platform'. At least not freely. For at this point I believe it is becoming more and more clear, that peoples rights to basic freedoms. Need to trump companies rights to restrict people. I happen not to like the idea of cyberpunk. Especially when that company has earned their money in part by promising NOT to moderate. When that was part of their selling point, that there was no limitations to what people could write about. Then no, they should not have any right to moderate their platform.

And considering the same nonsense excuse is now used in china. Where people will be restricted in how many hours a week people can play games. Not by the government, of course not. By the companies. Naturally game playing being a minor issue in the grad picture but still.

I really do not like governments having much say in peoples lives an matters. However one of the uses I do think the government should have, is to ensure companies do not start screwing people over in various ways. To restrict and regulate companies. Just pretending it is ok because it is companies that restrict people rather than the government I do not think works.

In any case, thank god for NovelAI who understand that privacy, free expression, peoples basic rights and so on, should be respected not just by governments, but also companies.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-10-17-225147","1634503907","None","1634504231.0","0","hh12ujf","False","t3_q8b5m0","False","t1_hh12ujf","True","t1_hgpmkc6","/r/AIDungeon/comments/q8b5m0/deleted_by_user/hh12ujf/","1646731910","1","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

I made a scenario where I was a princess who ran away with the blacksmith's daughter. We went to a cursed town (though we didn't actually get to go into the cursed town becauuse the AI decides that the blacksmith's daughter wanted to avoid getting into danger at all costs lol) so we continued along, ending in up some foggy woods in the log cabin/shack where we meet a pixie character. While staying the night in the shack, these masked figures appeared out of nowhere ( thanks to the AI's randomness) and because the masked figures had sensed that the pixie had some magic, the pixie decided to use his magic to not only become human, but to transport/teleport me and the blacksmith's daughter to safety but the blacksmith's daughter disappeared in the process. So me and the Pixie, now turned human (let's call the pixe Eli since that's the name I remembered him going by at some point), ended up finding a large demonic horn stuck in the ground. 

The horn kept pulsing with demon magic and driving Eli crazy or something until Eli used the remainder of his magic to blast me to an even safer place. I kinda forgot what occurred after that besides somehow my character being taken by these mafia pixies who were involved in a plot line of my character being impregnated by Eli a some sort of alien experiment (yeah the AI went there with it's randomness and I barely fixed it's outputs xD) but Eli rebelled against his ""masters"" and helped me escaped, only for us to return to the cabin wehre we first met and we found soem girl called Faye who apparently had the memories of the Blacksmith's Daughter but at the same time she wasn't the Blacksmith's Daughter? (the AI couldn't make up it's mind at this point). So, ""Faye,"" me, and Eli went back to my character's castle where my father wouldn't let me stay with Eli and the three of us ended up running away (once more) and while I can't remember what happened. I do remember that near the end of the story, my character finally gave birth to the baby but Eli killed it (no seriously, I vividly remember the pixie-human man picking up the baby and dropping it, while laughing maniacally.. at least that's what the AI wrote). And all of a sudden, me and Eli are looking up at the stars and Eli admits that he's my character's real father.

TLDR: I made an adventure where a princess was supposed to fall in love with the blacksmiths daughter but the blacksmiths daughter ended up disappearing and the princess meets a pixie who is part of some kind of alien abduction mafia story line and the princees and the pixie end up as lovers AND Father and Daughter...","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-10-18-032500","1634520300","None","False","0","hh21rz8","False","t3_q9vsxf","False","t1_hh21rz8","False","t3_q9vsxf","/r/AIDungeon/comments/q9vsxf/tell_your_favorite_journey_from_aid/hh21rz8/","1646729817","8","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

Is that confirmed? I thought the way they worded it in the [Walls Approach](https://latitude.io/blog/the-walls-approach) blog post implied they'll just redirect you to the Latitude AI if you hit the filter. I.E. that ""Specific request"" will be routed to a latitude model. 

Like, they phrased it as if openAI bans won't be a thing. 

IIRC, they might be trying to negotiate it with openAI how to handle it. 

It seems a bit dumb, to be honest. You set off openAI's filter, so they re-direct you to latitude AI instead. That's all fine and dandy. I just don't get why they also can perma-ban you from openAI, especially when the openAI filter is supposedly very broad and there's no feedback if you might be hitting the openAI filter. 

Ideally they can find some way to implement a broad ""openAI filter"" that auto-redirects anything that would hit openAI's filter to latitude before it even hits openAI. This way there'd be no need to dish out openAI shadowbans.

EDIT: Of course, unless the openAI filter can also trigger on AI outputs, I.E. you send a non-triggering input to openAI, the openAI AI model generates a filter-triggering response, and you get banned from openAI over it.

I do know there's a [""Train the AI""](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/696303815254605882/832378294061629450/unknown.png) setting where sometimes you get multiple outputs and you pick which one you prefer.

I.E. the AI doesn't learn from the entire story (It DOES have memory and seems to put two and two together a bit and ""learns"" a bit limited to the story only, for that one story, not other stories, or anyone else) but if for example, I talk about a ""Fishbed"" and I get the ""Pick a response"" prompt, and I choose the one about the MiG-21, and not a literal bed for a fish, the AI will tend to gravitate towards that (Likely by like a 10th of a percentage point) for everyone else when the AI is queried about the fishbed in the future.

Like, it does ""learn"" but very little. I'd imagine 99% of it is done on Latitude's/OpenAI's end and only 1% from the train the AI thing. 

I'd like to mention the AI seemingly knows about Among Us, which is significant because IIRC this came out long before Among Us was popular.

&gt;they had no place having a say and in what people wrote on their side

*Why not?* I'm not speaking for or against their decisions here, but the site is theirs. They have every right to set limitations on how it is used as they see fit.

&gt;The way they did it was a massive issue.

I can't say I disagree.

&gt;I consider myself scammed out of my money. 

Within certain limits I'd say you have a point, ethically at least if not legally. Latitude changed the terms of service without warning in the middle of a billing cycle, which was a really shitty thing for them to do. I do feel they should have offered a limited refund on any purchases made during that month to anyone who chose to cancel their membership. Any unspent scales that were bought prior to the change would have a similar issue and should also have been eligible for refund.

For anything before that, though, all I have to say is that AI Dungeon is offered as a monthly service, so if you were referring to subscription fees you have already received everything that you paid for. It's absurd to expect that a company will continue to operate without change because you paid for service that was already given in the past.

&gt;Why can I not be angry?

I certainly never said that you can't be, but what you actually said is that you'd like to act out authoritarian fantasies against the members of Latitude and their families. I do hope you recognize why most reasonable people would be offended by you choosing to express your anger in that way. It's particularly tone-deaf in light of the demands you're making in regards to your own rights and freedom.

&gt;That they delete stuff when the user asks to have it deleted is such a basic and reasonable expectation, I think even Facebook and Google is required to delete most stuff on their side within 3 months. Latitude not doing so is something I absolutely think should be criminal.

I strongly agree. To be clear I was not defending the practice, just noting that I have the understanding that they have maintained an archive of deleted content, at least at some point.

&gt;You say we can not have things because people make fantasy stuff that is not very nice or whatever. How am I even supposed to respond to that? 'Venting and working once anger out through writing and fantasy is why we can not have nice things?'

See my comments above. Should you have the right to have those fantasies in private if you wish it? Perhaps, but it is still deeply disturbing. You have no right to expect anyone else (yes, companies included) to give you a platform or have anything to do with it. It is also not your right to force Latitude to create content for you that they find offensive.

&gt;Maybe companies do have a right to moderate content,

They do, full stop. Your rights and freedoms do not surpass theirs, just so long as they are not discriminating against you on a basis that is protected under law.

&gt;Especially when that company has earned their money in part by promising NOT to moderate.

They said at one point that they did not do it, and I certainly hope for that period of time they honored it. However, once that's said and done they do have every right to modify their business practices, just as you have the right to discontinue your subscription and stop paying for it.

&gt;I really do not like governments having much say in peoples lives an matters. However one of the uses I do think the government should have, is to ensure companies do not start screwing people over in various ways.

I agree with this as well, though I reject the general premise that you were screwed over, for the reasons I've already mentioned. Latitude is not oppressing anyone's freedom by choosing not to supply certain kinds of content with their AI. It is also their right to monitor their service in any way they see fit, within the applicable legal limits.

&gt;In any case, thank god for NovelAI who understand that privacy, free expression, peoples basic rights and so on, should be respected not just by governments, but also companies.

I'm not quite sure that's what they're doing in regards to *all* companies, but I'd still say that I conditionally support the sentiment. I'm an Opus-tier subscriber of NovelAI myself and I agree that they're doing very good work.

The way I've put it before is like this: I respect that Latitude feels they have a responsibility to limit their service to disallow offensive content, but I also appreciate that NovelAI does not.

 [In single-player video games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permadeath#In_single-player_video_games) 
 
 &gt;Most arcade games (such as Space Invaders and Pac-Man, for example) have permadeath, so the term is usually used in reference to role-playing games where it is less common. Few single-player RPGs exhibit death that is truly permanent, as most allow the player to load a previously saved game and continue from the stored position. The subgenre of roguelike games is an exception, where permadeath is a high-value factor of these games. While players can save their state and continue at a later time, the save file is generally erased or overwritten, preventing players from restarting at that same state.

I did a zombie one once, for example, which started the player off in the middle of the street with some kind of randomly generated equipment or loot, then the quest was simply to ""find shelter."" I found it very useful as a way to offer open-ended suggestions for how to proceed without having it be something that I forced into the narrative.

EDIT: There might be some value with leaving the quest UI in, with a message added to make it clear that it doesn't actually do anything. That would have worked well enough for my purposes, so leaving that as an option for those who want it might be a fair compromise without the expense.

It sounds the only way to catch one now is to break the rules in public.

There is still going to be a filter, but it’s not going to trigger a ban or flag your account for review. According to what they’ve said, all it does is to try to prevent the AI from generating the kind of stuff they’ve prohibited. I’d think of it as being a bit like safe mode, but more narrow so that most NSFW content is still allowed. Regardless though, triggering it won’t ban you; the AI will just refuse to give a response and tell you to try something else.

EDIT: Also, the new Griffin uses an open source model isn’t run by OpenAI, so unless you use Dragon they and their content restrictions are out of the picture completely.

Now you don't get banned or suspended due to triggering the filter. If the AI can't come back with a response due to the context that you're writing in, it simply tells you that and asks you to take the story in a different direction.

Sad to see hardcore/quest detection being removed for the time being, but glad to hear that they'll be coming back! Personally I loved quest generation, especially on the worlds I created myself. They gave me a goal to work towards and it was great for giving me inspiration on possible scenarios that can even come from all of the world info that I crammed into my worlds.

I've got some questions though - if quest generation is going to be improved, do you guys plan on adding the ability to generate additional quests when in-game? One thing that always bummed me out is that once I completed that initial generated quest, I had no idea where to go on from there. Being able to generate another quest after completing the initial quest would be great for expanding my stories even further!

Or perhaps having the ability to generate side quests as well? Going on a silly ""help Farmer Joe find his lost chicken"" mission while on your way to defeat the Demon King would be great, lol.

Additionally - any plans on bringing back JudgeBot? I miss that guy. :(

I agree with the player character hardly dying. Maybe they should bring back the skills system, but I wish the AI considered failure more often. Often you need ""You attempt"" or ""You try"" to make a fight even remotely fair, nothing stops you from just saying ""You fight him and win."" Describing the fight in detail ""You line up your pipper on the enemy aircraft and pull the trigger, showering it with high explosive shells from your jet's internal 23mm cannon."" tends to give me more drawn out fights but I'm lucky if my enemies can last more than a few turns.

EDIT: Griffin Beta I know little about. All I know is it's slightly weaker than normal griffin iirc, however Griffin Beta has a longer memory context thing I believe and new training data I think. Supposedly despite being weaker, Griffin Beta actually is better than normal Griffin in terms of story generation. As an analogy, it's like how IQ doesn't always correlate with intelligence.

Beside, it's not like every single indivual worker at Lattitude is directly responsible for what happened and is the one who personally pushed the button. They're employees. Of course the situation must have been awkward for them too, they were under a lot of fire, and they have a right to express it.

And Lattitude has now explained most of why everything happened anyway. Make of those explanations what you will, that's your right, but what more do you expect them to do exactly? Recently they've taken good, tangible steps toward improvement and making amends. I prefer that than useless wordy apologies that wouldn't erase anything, and which they have done too anyway--they said they regret a lot of things and how they were handled.

Sad fact: Most people use the words human and person interchangeably.

There isn't much genetic nor neurological difference between animals and animals.

Generally when an animal dies, we realize that the spiritual/mental/digital component of their existence is gone. And was actually much more important than body type.

An animal is a machine, and a spirit is the operating system, and a person is a mental construct which has learned how to alter itself and is aware of its capability to do so. Of course, all of this can be simulated, and I would argue that our mental simulation of ourselves is much more human than the deterministic reality. Since we have more control over our self-perception than over our physical form.

For example, the self-conceptualization of being a furry is more human in my eyes than the behaviour of a sketchy car salesman. Even if the sketchy car salesman uses human body language and the furry only uses text. Because the simulation of being a furry is capable of altering their own existence, whereas the sketchy car salesman's shallow body language is more contrived than a dysphoric homo sapiens choosing to exist as a furry.

A “Person” is “a human being regarded as an individual.” 

As for consciousness, that’s up in the air. It is not well understood what happens to create it and what happens when life functions cease. 

Do I love my dog? Absolutely, is my dog a person? No. Does my dog have a personality? Yes. I would never describe my dog as a person though, nor as my child since not only is that wildly inaccurate but diminishes the unique differences between different species.

Genetic building blocks amongst all life forms on earth are quite similar since we all evolved on the same planet that makes sense.
We share 60% of genetic material with bananas, and 90% with cats.

The configuration and expression of the genetic coding matters much more than the amount of code that is in common however.

My friends are always playing as bandits, so attacking the shopkeeper is par-per-course!

Back when I used to be active in AI Dungeon, I used scripts to roll a dice then add ""You succeed"" or ""You fail!"" just before letting the AI generate a response. For gameplay scenario's it worked out okayish---a little rerolling and rewriting was necessary to get the AI into the groove of things. It kind of tended to dramatic successes and failures without guidance.

But I used AID more for novel writing, so I'm actually over at NAI nowadays.

If any of you have even been here since april and saw my other comments you'd know i was one of the harshest motherfuckers and willing to slam them and anybody who took their side at every opportunity and point out the bullshit i saw firsthand. Hell, i even took it to YouTube to warn everyone via my own video and on other videos to warn of the current state of the game at the time. I don't condone a fucking thing of what went down and i still agree that going radio silent was a shit decision of theirs. And if Novel Ai were free or i had the knowledge/Patience to figure out better alternatives, i WOULD HAVE left. Thing is, I wanted either Latitude to fix their jank ass mess, Or to keep warning everyone to swap to Novel Ai until i could too. But Since the Filter got (mostly) Fixed and private content moderation/bans are no longer there and they finally started talking again, I'm willing to give them a second chance and cooperate for the better of the game. (Especially after learning OpenAI is half to blame for it,  And somewhat because i have not much reason to leave anymore, now that my issues with it are gone.) Trust me, they fuck up again and I'll be the first to let them hear it. I'm sick of Developers being idiots and brushing off the people that buy their shit to give them something they don't want. (Looking at you, Ubisoft. Nobody fuckin' asked for XDefiant.) 

DO NOT assume i condone this shit just because i stuck around. And while you're at it, Do as you said you were doing and move on, Because - 

&gt;But it does make sense that the only people left would be the ones who are OK with their actions.

Since you wanna make assumptions, Sure seems to me like you're not all too keen on A second chance yourself.

And yes, I'm aware this comment i have made is rude as shit. I'm not apologizing. They're making an effort to right their wrongs and people are still sticking around just to Throw venom their way. Like i keep saying, i get skepticism. But if you're writing them off completely and won't Try to cooperate and give them a second chance, then you might as well just get out, Because sticking around JUST to slam them, Is NOT helping anything. At all. Nothing comes of it except Irritating the ones who are willing to try and help them make amends.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-10-23-145953","1634993993","None","1634994175.0","0","hhqkxtf","False","t3_qd2o18","False","t1_hhqkxtf","False","t1_hhmeqgd","/r/AIDungeon/comments/qd2o18/latitude_streaming_on_twitch_right_now_no/hhqkxtf/","1646247219","4","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

That means if the key words aren't mentioned then your world info is pointless. But that doesn't mean you need to remember and trigger all those key words yourself.

Example: bad world info

&gt;Entry: You live in New City. New City is full of skyscrapers

This world info is bad because if you don't mention ""New City"" in your story, then New City won't even exist.

Example: good world info

&gt;Keys: New City, city, map, run, walk, go, head, look, dash, rush, building

&gt;Entry: You live in New City. New City is full of skyscrapers

In this case, you should write everything you will possibly use to describe your character's movement in the keys. So if your character ""walk outside"" or ""head towards the park"", the world info will be triggered and the AI will remember that you are in New City with skyscrapers and will possibly mention them.

If you're a Griffin user, you should stick to Griffin-Beta, which is Latitude's in-house model (based on GPT-J-6B, an open-source model made by Eleuther), because: (1) OpenAI can't go behind Latitude's back to snoop around your stories (basically take your data for ""research"" like the Taskup incident); (2) Latitude has full control over the model so they can tinker with it to improve quality and stuff; (3) Latitude plans to replace Griffin with Griffin-Beta soon, anyway :)

I'd understand if you plan to use Dragon (based on GPT-3 Davinci 175B made by OpenAI) though, since people can still get quite good results from it. Anyway, when using these AI storytellers no matter to roleplay for fun or to deal with personal issues, I'd suggest that you don't include private information like real names, real addresses, etc. in your stories. A unique enough name or setting can be traced back to you, if your stories are somehow leaked on the Internet through a third party (contractors that are hired to label data, for example).","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-10-25-052526","1635132326","None","False","0","hhy0yoj","False","t3_qetmix","False","t1_hhy0yoj","False","t1_hhx099g","/r/AIDungeon/comments/qetmix/illegal_to_sing/hhy0yoj/","1646230933","8","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

It's not that the quality has gone down (and even with Dragon, the AI always had its moments of weirdness or plain goofery anyway, even a year ago) but it's that it's working differently from what it used to, so you have to adapt your way of playing. I've been playing for over a year now, and my strategy of getting the AI to do what I want did change a lot since the beginning. But the quality is still there. 

Also, I think, for long-time users, the nostalgia may indeed be a factor as to why they might feel like the quality has dropped.

Even if it doesn't perform quite up to OpenAI's dragon's par with shorter contexts (though the benchmarks say it should be on par), a significantly longer context might still make it really worthwhile.

Also, how is it with token bans? Author's notes work by delimiting the AN with ""[Author's note: "" and ""]"", but at least with AI21's public beta's API, that approach didn't really work because you can't ban it from outputting ""["" and hence it'll often spew ANs back at you.

I think they were upset because the program that they loved was suddenly being filtered and the quality was reduced. They were also upset about a third party reading their private stories.

And no one knew the reasons because we weren't told about OpenAI's part in all of this. Quite understandably, because of not being told about openai requiring the filter and that it was a third party hired by openai that was reading the stories, the only one left to blame was latitude.

Now that everybody knows more about the situation and knows that latitude was kind of between a rock and a hard place, partly their own fault for lack of communication, and the fact that they're currently improving the whole experience, maybe some will forgive and forget and start using AI dungeon again.

At least that's how I see the whole situation. I also didn't like the filter at first and how things were handled, so I tried novel, Holo and others and even at AI dungeons worst, I found it was still better than the alternatives.

So I kept using it and now with Ryan and Nick communicating with everyone and the updates, I'm pretty happy with it.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-10-26-101103","1635235863","None","False","0","hi39d7n","False","t3_qg0v3t","False","t1_hi39d7n","False","t3_qg0v3t","/r/AIDungeon/comments/qg0v3t/since_it_has_been_asked_daily_and_since_im_not/hi39d7n/","1646219626","24","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

I disagree because I don't think the AI's generation quality ever went down. I did unsub for a while, but that was because I wanted my relationship with Latitude to be a positive, dignified one, not one where I give them money and they make condescending insinuations about me being a child abuser because I used the word ""boy"" in a story. At no point have I felt that Dragon's performance has got worse or better in a way that felt at all different from its usual randomness.

It's still frustrating that AID has spent its entire existence flailing about making obviously terrible product, technical, and PR decisions (though Ryan has been busy cleaning up their act recently), while NAI has such a clear vision of how to actually solve their users' problems and the technical chops to build a really high-quality service to do it. If I was going to give money to the team that I thought *deserved* it, I'd be a NAI sub.

Meanwhile, Latitude has barely ever lied to its community, and the lack of communication this past year during the controversies doesn’t count.

Those of you who aren't PR have conveniently ignored the fact that AID as a company is NOT SECURE and they lied to you repeatedly about it. All of your stories private have been leaked.

The shutdown of Explore wasn't because of degenerate content. It was because Explore had a security flaw. So did the feedback system. The guy who discovered it gave them a heads up MONTHS earlier and AID didn't fix the holes. So, the guy told AID that he's going to tell the public in a few weeks time, with full proof he was able to pull EVERYBODY'S stories. AID panicked. OpenAI was furious and said, ""Okay guys, because your shit was leaked, we're going to treat you like a publishing outlet."" 

And that's why AID started policing everybody's private stories. All the while, AID was shifting the blame into it's users. Labeling their community as degenerates. Never admitting the leaks until the hacker dude published his full report.

The lies first started when they did a spontaneous pull of the explore page and said they were doing ""improvements"" and it will be back soon.

*Edit:* Just to be clear here, I've actually maintained my AI D subscription along with Novel AI. I'm not actually picking sides so much as saying out of the two, I use Novel AI far more. If Latitude could get AI D to actually recognize Worlds content (which it never did when I tried the feature), I'd be likely to use it a lot more.

The differences in vocab size, architecture, and the few additional parameters seem like they'd result in a boost in quality, but in practice GPT-3 still tends to do better.  This gap could potentially be closed with some additional finetuning on high quality data, but the amount of training necessary would likely be nontrivial and would need to be done on AI21's end since, if I understand correctly, AI21's model is closed source just like GPT-3 was.  If that can be done, great!

However, speaking personally, OpenAI's policies (well, not so much the policies themselves, but rather, their methods of implementing those policies, such as the Taskup incident) have concerned me very greatly.  Because of that, I'd be willing to take the quality hit, but I would appreciate knowing AI21's policies as well as how these policies will be implemented in something like AI Dungeon (for instance, will filters be used like with OpenAI?  What about privacy?  What policies are in place there as opposed to with OpenAI's models?  Having a better understanding of where things stand in this regard going forward would be much appreciated).","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-10-27-081409","1635315249","None","False","0","hi7t4k1","False","t3_qfrctm","False","t1_hi7t4k1","False","t1_hi1p8mo","/r/AIDungeon/comments/qfrctm/dragonbeta_now_launching_for_platinum_subscribers/hi7t4k1/","1646209864","4","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

To me... it feels pretty dire. I think Sigurd might be better. I'll have to see if I can easily script up something to switch between the models for me so that I can do a properly blinded test between them, because maybe my opinion could be *really* colored by a bad first impression... but it seems pretty unlikely. Right now, I'm really hoping we don't lose access to OpenAI Dragon, because it's the only reason why I'm paying for AI Dungeon.

Not link all that. But, that works too.

&gt;Here is the official data leak and the entire story of how the penetration tester approached it, including his prior security warnings he tried to give to Latitude that they completely ignored

Except reading it had little to no indication they ignored it...in fact, From what i read, they said latitude Addressed the issues and took their advice, i didn't see any indication of lat ""Ignoring"" the warnings, It seemed to say they were addressed, just not to the satisfaction of the tester from how i read it.

&gt;Here is the thread where they lied through their teeth over and over during the early stages of the hack. I seriously recommend you give all the comments a read because the devs answered many of them

I did. Didn't sense any Lying. Which specific dev, if there was one, Was answering all of this? Because the comments didn't come off as dishonest, they just came off as slightly awkward, as if an Introvert wrote them. (I'm the same way when i want to make a good first impression. I muddle words and look stupid as a result.) And most of the comments were just saying they wished they got a notification ahead of time or argued for why bringing explore down was or wasn't a good idea. A running theme was ""user safety"" being a confusing talking point which i noted. But from what was gathered, they meant user safety as in providing a safe game environment for them (i.e Free of harassment and threats.) But again, You seemed to be putting 2 and 2 together and getting 5,  but i got 4. They're not a big company like EA and fucking up is gonna happen but they want to be honest and improve the game for the betterment if its playerbase. Reasonable enough. I guess A fault would be saying they didn't wanna do like big companies do and ignore the community (Albeit they totally fucking did with the radio silence.) But saying ""i don't wanna do _____ "" and then preceeding to do said thing don't make it a lie. Don't get me wrong, it's a dick move, but not a lie. I know they also talk about being transparent ( which means being honest and open) and i guess They're pretty vague which goes against being open about it. However let's remember, It's usually hard as fuck to accurately and clearly convey what you want to say over the internet. Miscommunication is easy when you can't talk face to face, And people often have a lack of patience to read a whole paragraph worth of thoughts on a subject. I always tend to mean shit one way but it gets taken another way because i wasn't clear enough on accident or they didn't read the whole damn thing and it sparks a big argument. It's annoying, But can't be helped without Being extremely precise with your words. Point is It's hard to accurately convey shit through a simple comment. Just because they wanna be transparent don't mean it's guaranteed that they can be.

i'm also used to Looking for contradictions in people's statements to what i say to see if my comment was misread by whoever I'm arguing with...i didn't see any contradictions in Lat's replies, Just the aforementioned transparency/Radio silence issues.

Lastly.

&gt;Here is another thread where the devs deleted many of their original responses around that time.

Ok first of all, Why do people always think you're trying to cover up some shit when you delete your own responses? I do the same shit (albeit rarely) When i reread something i said, Realize how stupid it sounds and get rid of it because i don't agree with it anymore.  Who's to Say lat's not the same way? It's pretty normal for people to not agree with what they said in the past and/or think it was dumb to say and delete it without having to be friggin' hiding something. Also, Since their comments are now deleted, I don't even know what they were talking about in each comment to judge that aspect and because other users had theirs deleted too it was difficult to pinpoint which were dev comments. (And Apologies for my skepticism but i wouldn't find you a trustworthy source to interperet comments they made that i can't even double-check myself. Especially with the comments you had in those threads showing a bit of a negative Bias toward them. And to somewhat answer your question as to why they didn't Test the new explore on their own in a controlled testing environment first, Just a hunch, but Probably because they wanted to get rid of all the incest stories and shit on regular explore first and thumbing through them all individually would probably take a while. The same comment threads even mentioned that ""epidemic"" of content.)

Also reading through these, A lot of those comments take my side in Seeing nothing out of the ordinary with what Lat were doing. Hell, i think i saw more positive comments and questions than i did suspicious ones, So i know it's not just me. Regardless, You don't have to agree with a damn thing i said in this long-ass disquisition. If anything, I'm expecting you to Downvote this one because i disagree with you, like you did the last one. But opinions are opinions. I saw nothing wrong, you thought it was sketchy, Whatever, big whoop, our side is our own. Now if you'll excuse me, i have to go nurse an upset stomach because I've been tense as fuck all day.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-10-27-224811","1635367691","None","False","0","hiancp4","False","t3_qft3it","False","t1_hiancp4","False","t1_hi9uuti","/r/AIDungeon/comments/qft3it/i_cant_open_it_yet_though/hiancp4/","1646203762","4","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

The silliness can be mitigated with a little effort.

 &gt;Reptilians – also called reptoids, lizard people, reptiloids, saurians, or draconians – are supposed reptilian humanoids, which play a prominent role in fantasy, science fiction, ufology, and conspiracy theories. The idea of reptilians was popularised by David Icke, a conspiracy theorist who claims shapeshifting reptilian aliens control Earth by taking on human form and gaining political power to manipulate human societies. Icke has stated on multiple occasions that many world leaders are, or are possessed by, so-called reptilians.

GPT is eager to run away with whatever them it's given, so all it would take is a programmer's error message and a couple brackets or a function name and AID might run away with it.

One perhaps likely possibility is something going wrong with text formatting or something involved with passing the text to AID from the user. If a function involved with taking the text from the text box and passing it to OpenAI gets broken it could result in snippets of code-related symbols or formatting or an error message AID would recognize as code-related being inserted as part of the prompt. Then it would ""do as it do"" and get all weird and code-ish toward the user for no visible reason.

Also, while formats for Memory/World Info *do* exist, and *do* still work, I've personally always found normal prose to be better than any formats.

Generally, stuff that you want to be remembered at *all* times should be put in the Memory, such as info about your character. World Info should be used for stuff that the AI only needs to remember info on *sometimes*, like for less important characters, and for locations, and such. Author's Note should be used to describe the writing style, and optionally, the genre and setting of the story. It can also be used to let the AI know how a scene should play out.

As for the randomness, that's kind of an inherent issue with the AI. Good use of Memory/World Info/Author's Note can help the AI to stay on track, but the AI will always be somewhat random. Since you presumably have a premium subscription, since you mentioned checking out Dragon, you can also turn down the randomness in your settings. Also, ""Story"" inputs generally work better than ""Do"" or ""Say"" inputs if you want coherence. The AI generally processes ""Do"" and ""Say"" inputs as a *suggestion* of what should happen. ""Story"" inputs are just processed as being part of the story. It's also worth noting that Dragon can only remember about 2800 characters of info at a time, so you *need* to utilize Memory and World Info if you want the AI to actually remember stuff, and you should try to keep your Memory and World Info concise, whilst omitting details that the AI won't use. For example, putting your eye color in the Memory would just kinda be a waste of some of the AI's context limit, since the AI will rarely, if ever, need to know your eye color.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-10-30-173024","1635607824","None","False","0","hini8ic","False","t3_qj3car","False","t1_hini8ic","False","t3_qj3car","/r/AIDungeon/comments/qj3car/i_need_some_guide_or_faq/hini8ic/","1646176115","6","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

Just write your world info and remember as if you're explaining then to a human. Don't use any format, just plain text (I've read that there's no evidence that these formats actually work better) with just a few things to keep in mind. I found these 2 things about world info and remember that is most important to remember:

1. Don't use negative. Pretty clear. Don't use ""you can't die"", use ""you are immortal"" (though in this example the AI really don't understand the whole concept of immortal so you might still die)

2. You MUST be very clear when describing a character in WI. For example, ""Mario has red cap"" is a weak statement for the AI because has or have are weak connectors on the AI's eyes. If you're using has, then the AI will most likely disregard everything that is put after the word has. Instead, try something more akin to ""Mario's cap is red"". Maybe it looks the same to humans, but to AI, this is a major improvement because now it knows that the cap is associated with the color red. tl;dr: stop using has, start using is, eg Bob's hair is black, Mario's jumpsuit is blue (copy paste from wiki)

Also this is my own tip you might find this useful:

By nature, I don't really do shit in my adventures that I'd mind if other people saw it, nor would I care if it warrants judgment from other people. There's rape in my scenarios, but it's explicitly worded as gross, and done by unsavory people to further characterize them as bad guys... that's about as spicy as it gets, the smut is pretty tame, and gore is, well, just gore lol

I'd imagine that other people have... something to hide, though, or people just have shit they like that they're insecure about. These people directly benefit from the fact that no one reads through the adventures. Now, what do I have to gain from people looking through scenarios? Nothing.

It's not really a matter of privacy for me lol

It's a good time to be had, put on some environmental ambient music/sounds to enhance the effect.   


Yep yep, the Dragon model was trained on more stuff and (from what I hear) can be a lot of fun.
