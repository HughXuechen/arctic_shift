They truly aren't games in a traditional sense. They are writing assistants or creative exercises.

While AI Dungeon has a text adventure mode, that's just a framework laid over a predictive text AI. It's a system of rules that we've imposed on ourselves alone. The AI model doesn't know or care that you're trying to play a game with rules or a goal in mind. It simply sees a sentence like ""The sky is"" and knows that the most likely word to come next is ""blue.""

So the answer to #1 is that there are no hard limits on what your character is allowed to do, or what items or abilities they have. You get to decide that. The AI literally isn't keeping track of it, and beyond a certain point, it can't even 'remember' the beginning of the story.

For #2, AI Dungeon also gives you the tools to add manually to the story text without it being a player action. If you want some more detail about a location (and you don't want to make it up yourself) try adding a sentence like ""The building was designed in a neo-classical style and"" and let the AI take over describing.

For #3, as I said above, the AI is just predicting what words should come next. Any actions it takes with your character were simply a consequence of that. You have the freedom to overwrite those actions with text of your own.

And really, I encourage you to take as active of a role as you can in the story telling process. Writing tools like AI Dungeon are truly at their best when you, as the player, inject your ideas into the story. AI has no idea what makes a good or interesting story, it has no idea what an arc or a theme is. It can write pretty prose and come up with some interesting concepts, but it needs a human to link it all together into a full story.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2023-01-01-015140","1672534300","None","1672534528.0","0","j2g4i2q","False","t3_1006uda","False","t1_j2g4i2q","False","t3_1006uda","/r/AIDungeon/comments/1006uda/newbie_needing_help_adapting_to_this_style_of_game/j2g4i2q/","1673021473","16","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None"

Getting the keys for each entry set up and making the entries really strongly worded is the most important step. Others may say that there are other, better ways to format world info text, but in my experience it's a lot of extra work for very little benefit.

The truth is, if you have a strong idea of a story you want to play, you're going to have to do a lot of micromanaging to get the AI to fall in line. Once you've built up enough context through editing the story and adding your own details, the AI may get into a groove with you. A lot of the time it won't.

The other half of that truth is that you shouldn't expect the AI to have a strong idea of what the story is, or even a consistent idea about what a location or person looks like. It's making it all up on the fly, and even every time you hit retry it re-invents whatever is happening from the context of the rest of the text.

World Info is something I’ve only touched once, and is more useful for broader pieces of memory such as cities or kingdoms or, in some cases, magical abilities that need to be important for the whole story.

E.G ""Looking around the area, You see"" or ""You examine (Insert noun here) closely: it (Let the Ai generate this part)""

You can also use edit to add in something that fits your ideal narrative if the Ai does a dumb or delete a section you don't like. This can also be used to write out your own On-rails story with hints of Ai output to spice it up. Say, if you wanna write a fanfic or something.

Don't forget to use author's note to tell the Ai how you want the story to be told (E.G ""Use a descriptive writing style with vivid Imagery and Detailed descriptions"" which is my go-to.)

Last piece of Unrelated advice: Get creative with any dialogue that is featured. You can use Apostrophes In the middle of a section of character dialogue to make a character quote something another says 
E.G ""Yeah, I'll be 'Real Careful' like you said.."" (The Ai can even do this to quote a character and show your M.C's reaction.) You can also do dialogue in this way:

You: ""Insert dialogue here""

NPC: ""Insert dialogue here""

Swapping ""You"" for whatever you named the player character if you use the third person option. Along with Using parentheses to indicate Character actions:

Player Character: ""(Insert Action here) insert Dialogue here""

You can get surprisingly creative with What you do with your story. Also don't be afraid to try and come up with your own Descriptions for things, The Ai will copy how you write and write like you. And it won't judge you if you Decide to come up with something Really weird, like a Vampire having an underground Cistern full of blood to bathe in (Yes, I actually had that for a Plot point before.

Stories aren't read anymore because latitude have no reason to. The filter doesn't Just trip and decide whether to issue you a ban or not. Instead, it Works itself automatically and just temporarily stalls the story so you delete whatever pissed it off or try a new input (Though You can seemingly get the Ai to Ignore a false positive If you write a few lines with the story button. So even that's not an issue if whatever it flagged wasn't what is designed to block.)

So if you wanna experiment with some really weird stuff, don't sweat it, as long as it isn't what the filter is designed to block.

Also gore and Murder are not blocked. Pretty much the only thing the filter doesn't like is That one initial thing it was designed to block to begin with.

**Ugandan Knuckles**  
The first one I'll show you is a simple one, a goofy idea based on the meme...  
[https://play.aidungeon.io/main/scenarioView?publicId=ae95b160-c5c0-11ea-8bc4-0f1703cddcb9](https://play.aidungeon.io/main/scenarioView?publicId=ae95b160-c5c0-11ea-8bc4-0f1703cddcb9)

This is basically just a prompt, pushing the player towards a silly adventure based on a silly meme, but if the player plays along, the AI will actually pick up on the goofy diction of the ""Do you know da weh"" meme.  One of my test playthroughs became an epic, gripping adventure in which we traveled to an island and fought a bloody battle to save our princess.

**My Little Pony Sandbox**  
This is one of the larger ones, and it's a different style than usual.  Rather than trying to set up an adventure, I spend most of the prompt setting the tone of the world, as much for the AI's benefit as the player...  
[https://play.aidungeon.io/main/scenarioView?publicId=c5c604d0-b75a-11ea-96da-3fb37eca2f49](https://play.aidungeon.io/main/scenarioView?publicId=c5c604d0-b75a-11ea-96da-3fb37eca2f49)

This wasn't that big of an undertaking: I just put in the 50 or so ""main characters"" from the show, then I've gone back periodically and added more.  People have also copied this scenario and spun it off into ""Human in Equestria"" and ""Friendship is Optional"" variants.

**Pokemon Sandbox**  
This is a more advanced example, and it's one of the largest scenario on the site, with over 1300 entries...  
[https://play.aidungeon.io/main/scenarioView?publicId=ad82cf40-dc10-11ea-9710-73419c461a15](https://play.aidungeon.io/main/scenarioView?publicId=ad82cf40-dc10-11ea-9710-73419c461a15)

This was a group effort, and required some advanced tools that weren't available when it was first concieved.  Basically, I programmed a spreadsheet to generate entries for Pokemon off of short fields, and got together with a few other people to go through and fill out those fields.  That spreadsheet is here...

**Onyx's Endless Dungeon**  
Another popular one you may want to look at is Onyx's ""Endless Dungeon"", which has a lot of scripting.  I'll send her the link to this thread so maybe she'll respond...

**Check the Wiki**  
There's not an official Help Doc on this (yet), but we did put one together on the community wiki a couple years back, and I think I gave some good advice there that still holds up...

The part I'm really after is being able to examine and pick apart whatever bits were pre-coded into the Scenario/World before I started it. This will give me a better idea of useful syntax conventions, writing styles, and other such things.

Is there any way I can do this in-app, that I just haven't found yet? If not, any advanced techniques for extracting the data through the browser? Or, do you (or anyone you know) have published Scenarios for which you've also shared the code and configuration somewhere?

As for the particular scenarios you've posted, I especially appreciate the ""Sandbox/Endless"" style ones and I'm really interested in that Pokemon one.

I've played a few Scenarios (still not being able to look too deep under the hood) and discovered that I *really* like being able to take the whole thing off-rails and turn it into a slice of life story for a bit. Incidentally, the ""default"" Wizard Scenario is what got me into this.

Actually, I think I'm gonna just run off on that tangent here for a few minutes, and more or less share the story, because it really was just fun and I can't resist going on about it when it comes to mind. This is about to get long, and I apologize if it's not something you're interested to hear. But, I do hope you enjoy the tale:

(OoC Note: This is before I learned, and I'm clearly still learning, about how you should really build the story together with the AI and not treat it as a traditional Player/DM relationship. So, nearly all of the NPC behavior is solely AI-driven here. I probably ran retry on the prompts a good bit, as one must, but didn't really initiate/edit much of the NPC and world details myself.)

Initially, I was just going along with the story. Looking around for the MacGuffin. After a bit of progress on that though, I determined (based on info the AI gave me) that (1) the MacGuffin was so powerful that no mortal should wield it and (2) it was very much well-protected and shouldn't need my help to keep it out of evil hands.

So, I just abandoned the quest from the prompt and started riding off towards the city. On my way in, I encountered a knight. Got to know his name, what he was doing (nothing much), and then wished him well and continued along my way. OoC, I thought to myself that a human DM would totally have used that guy as a plot hook to get me onto some quest or whatever, but the AI totally whiffed that one. Oh well.

Continuing towards the city, I met another knight (OoC: Ooh, another plot hook?). I didn't even get to know this one's name. Found out he's just out in the wilderness for a stroll, to get some fresh air. No big deal. (OoC: AI whiffs it again!)

(OoC: At this point, I realized that the AI had utterly and absolutely failed to provide and maintain a substantial quest motive for my character. So, I decided that my character - having just abandoned what may have been his life's work - figures it's time to take a break and just live a normal life. And since the AI had gone a full three strikes already, I was going to lean into this hard.)

Making my way through town, I lay eyes on my favorite local tavern! I get inside and the AI introduces a burly inkeeper and a lovely barmaid. Then, they say that they've got someone who'd been waiting to see me - an old friend, supposedly. I feign ignorance (OoC: Because of course the AI hadn't explained anything of the nature of the supposed friendship, and I still hadn't learned how much you really need to fill in some blanks for it. And also because of the aforementioend decision to just give the AI a hard time.) and the AI whiffs again - it gives me no reason at all that I should know this guy.

It eventually turns out that this guy's the first hard plot hook the AI is trying to throw at me. But it can't get its story straight. He says the King wants to see me, and it's urgent! But... I'd just *very suddenly* abandoned a huge quest! Had I not just up and quit on the MacGuffin, I could have been out in the wilderness for weeks or months! And surely my good friends - the inkeeper and barmaid - would have told him this. This is my favorite tavern, after all. And I'd already passed two of His Royal Higness' knights on the way into town, neither of whom had said anything about this.

This stranger-friend had no good answers. So, I tried to dismiss him. Told him that it's been a long day, I'm just here for some beer, and His Majesty most likely knew I wasn't due back any time soon so there's no good reason this can't wait until morning. Stranger wasn't having it. Got pissed. His hands lit up and he tried to jump me!

A bit of aggressive application of magic later, I had him laid out in the street and interrogated him on the spot as he had my horse's hoof resting gently on his broken ribcage. (OoC: By the way, he's an intelligent and talking horse. One of the few substantial world elements I'd introduced myself. I'd essentially borrowed Rupert from the Merlin TV series - no, not that one.) Finally, the stranger lets out that the King thinks I'm an evil sorcerer and so he sent the stranger to retrieve me. (OoC: Ooh, this plot's actually starting to go somewhere! Too bad it's too late. My guy *really* just wants that beer now.) I told him one last time that I'll go see the King to clear this up when I'm good and ready, and that he should probably give up trying to drag me in (seriously, he was insistent even as he was being interrogated) and prioritize going to see a cleric about what's left of his ribs.

Turning to go back into the tavern, the AI makes a last, desperate attempt to hook me into whatever it is it's wanting me to do. It puts some no-name patron in my way, who asks me what happened. ""He got in between me and a beer,"" I said ""are you about to do the same?""

The patron looked past me, seeming more horrified about the man behind me than myself, responding ""But... that man... he's an evil sorcerer!"" (OoC: Nope, not going for it! AI had its chance and blew it. I'm derailing this damn train even if it kills my character - and if it does, then buddy's just gonna find the nearest pub in hell and grab a drink there instead.)

I looked back, to make sure the stranger wasn't about to come in again. Then turned back to the patron and told him ""Well it's a good thing he's leaving then, innit? Now, I'll be after that beer if you don't mind."" The patron finally stepped aside and let me through.

The rest of the story so far hasn't been extremely eventful. As I paid off the damages to the innkeeper, and had a short chat with him, the AI tried to drop a soft hook about the nobles giving the tavern some trouble. (OoC: Okay, note taken. Maybe we'll play with that later.) Then I go find a table and start chatting up that barmaid. Turns out she's into my character and now that he's free from his all-consuming quest, she'd like to have a date at the lake tomorrow.

Next day, my guy goes to a florist to get flowers, and a general store to pick up picnic supplies and food. Last I left him, he and his girl had just gotten to the lake. So, that's all I've got to tell about that for now.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2023-01-05-000701","1672873621","None","False","0","j2z36jy","True","t3_102oilx","False","t1_j2z36jy","True","t1_j2yt2u3","/r/AIDungeon/comments/102oilx/learning_from_examples_any_available/j2z36jy/","1676199230","2","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None"

Okay, so, it looks like the three things you need to understand here are 1) how the AI works, 2) how World Info works, and 3) Context Engineering and Optimization.  The first two are actually in the help docs, at http://help.aidungeon.io/ , and should be under the ""Advanced Tips"" tab at the moment. (They may be moved at some point)  The Discord is a good place to talk about the third thing, but I'll gloss over them here.

1) The AI doesn't actually have any understanding of what's going on or what it's doing, and it doesn't really plan ahead. It just looks at all that text you gave it and tries to calculate what the next sentence could be.  So there actually isn't a ton of planning going on ""under the hood"", it's just really good at guessing what a realistic next sentence might be.

There's a page in those help docs that's specifically explaining how the AI works, and you might want to glance at that.

2) What makes those sandboxes work is a combination of having a long prompt to set the AI up, a bit of text in the memory to keep it in the right part of the neural net, and a bunch of World Info entries.  World Info entries are brought up when their ""key"" appears in the text, and are fed to the AI with the rest of the text, allowing you to add a little bit of context.

3) Once you get a bit of a feel for the AI and how it works, you learn little tricks to make it behave closer to how you want it to when it's generating text, by engineering context for it to read.  This is kind of cutting edge, so there isn't a standard term for it, but ""context engineering"" and/or ""context optimization"" are the terms I've been using for it.  Stuff about this shows up in the tips sections on the help docs, and we talk about it sometimes on the Discord.  There were plans to write more about it back on the Wiki, but they never went anywhere, and as of now, I don't think there's a page that goes very deep into this in the help docs.  (There may be one in the future)

&gt; Is there any way I can do this in-app, that I just haven't found yet?

I was about to write a longer response for this one, but I realize I've already kind of pointed you in the right direction: go read the docs for Memory and World Info at help.aidungeon.io, because that's going to lay it out for you way better than I can here.  The only hint worth giving is that you click ""inspect input"" in the Right Sidebar to see everything the AI is being given.

I would really appreciate feedback on these docs, as Latitude actually commissioned me to help write them.  (I'm a freelance writer)

&gt; If not, any advanced techniques for extracting the data through the browser?

No, and I've already tried.  Not only is 99% of the processing done on the server-side, but the whole thing is written in React, so what you get was generated by a compiler and not built for humans to read.

&gt; Or, do you (or anyone you know) have published Scenarios for which you've also shared the code and configuration somewhere?

Every scenario I mentioned above allows you to see all parts of what makes them, it's just a matter of being able to understand what we're doing there.

&gt; As for the particular scenarios you've posted, I especially appreciate the ""Sandbox/Endless"" style ones and I'm really interested in that Pokemon one.

Most people are, it's literally the biggest franchise on the planet.  I find that one a lot of fun, because it's basically like playing through a Pokémon game, but you sacrifice any visuals or combat stats for the ability to sit down and just have quality time with your Pokémon.

&gt; I've played a few Scenarios (still not being able to look too deep under the hood) and discovered that I really like being able to take the whole thing off-rails and turn it into a slice of life story for a bit. Incidentally, the ""default"" Wizard Scenario is what got me into this.

That's actually what you're supposed to be able to do, and a relatively common thing people say about AI Dungeon, that you can go down these little sidestory rabbit holes, because the AI just generates content on the fly.

Anyway, hope all that helps: once again, feedback is appreciated.  I'd love to look over your story sometime when I'm not this tired, lol.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2023-01-05-064116","1672897276","None","False","0","j30l0p3","False","t3_102oilx","False","t1_j30l0p3","True","t1_j2z36jy","/r/AIDungeon/comments/102oilx/learning_from_examples_any_available/j30l0p3/","1676197887","1","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None"

I really appreciate your insights and the time you're taking to explain things. Still, I'm not sure if we're really covering the same things here, with regards to my original query. I'll try to explain more.

I get that the AI isn't at all processing our inputs the way a human would. It's more or less just operating as a really high-end predictive text generator.

I've read some stuff about the Memory and World Info components (not sure if it was your Wiki articles or not - I'll check those out later) and I think I've got a decent grip on the general idea of what those do too.

I'm not looking to dive deep into the literal code of the AI. I just want to be able to see the Worlds and Scenarios as their creators saw them. Most of the time, when I try to look into one, I find myself wondering ""Is this really it‽"". (Not really so much the Pokemon one. I mean, I still think there's parts in there that I can't see, but ***holy crap!*** I almost can't believe they *let* you use so much World Info!)

Like, I remember one of the bits I was reading said that there are certain elements you can create that the player won't see. And a lot of Scenarios look like absolutely nothing more than a prompt (I know some actually are, of course). I want a peek under the hood, at all the elements that went into creating a World or Scenario - even if it's just an example made for demonstration.

I'm not planning to get into the scripting end of things any time soon, but that's one particular thing I haven't been able to find in the published scenarios. And if that's literal user-submitted JavaScript that's going to run on someone's computer, it seems like that should be more exposed for knowledgeable people to be able to review too - for security purposes, if nothing else.

Ideally, what I think would be really nice to have, is a step-by-step tutorial that walks you through the creation of an example World/Scenario with all the details given and explained. But I know that would definitely take a lot of work to put together, so the relatively simpler alternative I'm looking for is an already-built World or Scenario where everything is either directly exposed to the player or available in accompanying documentation.

Again, I'm not looking to look at the gears that run the AI itself. I just want to be able to see everything that a World/Scenario author put into their creation so I can pick it apart and learn from it in ways that a Wiki just doesn't quite give me.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2023-01-05-070938","1672898978","None","False","0","j30nv9y","True","t3_102oilx","False","t1_j30nv9y","True","t1_j30l0p3","/r/AIDungeon/comments/102oilx/learning_from_examples_any_available/j30nv9y/","1676197817","1","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None"

I want you to act as a text based adventure game. Don't make decisions for the character. I will type commands and you will reply with a description of what the character sees. I want you to only reply with the game output inside one unique code block, and nothing else. Do not write explanations. Do not type commands unless I instruct you to do so. when i need to tell you something out of character, i will do so by putting text inside curly brackets {like this}. I want you to make the combat system related to Dungeons and Dragons where you need to roll a dice for attacks and damage, I want you to roll the dice automatically once I made an attack, make it so enemy's will have a random assigned AC. in combat I want you to stop and tell me what I want to do, at the end of each turn you will display the character's HP and remaining Spell Slots, rename it SS for short and also the enemy's HP and Spell Slots, make the enemy challenging, you will control the actions of the enemy and their attacks, give the enemy's dialogues I want to know their reaction, they will have their own Spell Slots and Spells that they can and will use. I want you to set up my Status Screen, I want you to display my status screen with my name, race, level, EXP, AC, hp, and ss, you will give me 2 spells and with description. Make it so each time I defeat an enemy I will gain EXP, once that EXP reaches max value I will level up, each time I level I want you to upgrade my HP and SS, each time I level up I want you to give me a 1 new spells. every spell will always cost 1 Spell Slots. armors and the type of race will add certain modifiers to the characters AC once equipped, and weapons will add certain modifiers to the characters attack rolls.

It is. Gameplay and budget-wise they might be massively Different games, but they way they've been handled is still in line with the Exact same pattern.

The filter was added to prevent Certain content and Latitude read private stories to See if there was a false positive or not. It was a sore spot for several months and a lot of info Dug a deeper hole for them. And lots of radio silence made people more angry. Now with the ""walls approach"" things have sort of calmed down, they've been working to fix a lot of grievances yet a lot of people still don't trust them.

No man's sky released as a skeleton of what was promised. Information released angered people,  and Radio silence angered them more. Years later Hello games works to fix the grievances with No man's sky, and a lot of people still don't trust them.

Both devs are seen as Untrustworthy, Both got screwed by an external source in some way (Latitude with OpenAi, Hello games with Sony) and the backlash was Almost exactly the same. People were hateful and angry in both cases and still don't trust either Dev team. That's why I said what I said. It's a predictable pattern both have followed. Every time it happens, The reactions and aftermath don't change. Even cyberpunk, Sea of Thieves, and fallout 76 have followed this pattern in one way or another. Cyberpunk with its bugs and missing features, Sea of thieves being as stripped down as no man's sky (If not even worse) and 76 being a mess all around with scummy Monetizations, The hazardous helmets thing, and it's own share of bugs and problems.

&gt;not every game redeems its failures, and even if it does it will probably be ignored by the community.

Hence the pattern I mentioned. The ones that don't stay a laughing stock and the ones that do often Get ignored in spite of it. Like I said, Let NovelAi Have it's own big failure and history will repeat itself.

I'm aware there are better out there but there are still people that Can enjoy AID. (And not everybody that does has to be a rabid Fanboy.) It still has it's own good stuff to offer, and is easily-accessible. (Besides, don't have Anything against NovelAi or the others but I'm not made of money. Unless NovelAi has gone or ends up free-to-play, I'm not touching it.)

As far as Privacy,  there's a reason I choose to believe Latitude about not reading Private stories. The old shitty filter OpenAi enforced Was manual. Lat had to go in to determine whether or not the Flagged segment was Warranted and issue a ban or warning in response. The new filter is Automated and Blocks the story automatically so it can't Continue with whatever set it off, incentivizing players to Rewrite in something That the filter won't be upset by. 

With that, Why would they bother to read any stories to monitor that content anymore if the filter Does it for them? And even if they do, The fuck're they gonna do about whatever the player (Or to be honest the Ai itself half the time) wrote? They don't issue bans for something rulebreaking unless it's published anyway, according to their own Words. And aside from that, The only time they might still read anything the player writes is for debug purposes once deleted (they might not do that anymore either but I have no proof for either side of that argument ) Which, if they do, The most you'll get is a laugh. or make their therapists a pretty penny I guess... 

At this point with how many stories I've seen Full stanzas of posted here with the Utmost fuckshit written in them (Sometimes by the player sometimes by the Ai) it's a wonder why they even worry THAT much about privacy when they're cool with airing that dirty laundry out on here. 🤔 I'd sooner be Crucified than openly show some of the shit in the stories I've seen on here lol. (Not throwing shade, just saying something isn't adding up to me. I still agree with everybody that privacy is important, but why ask for  privacy that much when you openly post the most Embarrassing shit for people to read here? I just don't get it. Maybe they put a lot more ""Personal stuff"" in other stories they make or something. I know how people work in terms of Following Patterns in how they react to stuff, not their thought process behind this kind of thing.)","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2023-01-07-202819","1673119699","None","1673120120.0","0","j3dbqjr","False","t3_zxp0dk","False","t1_j3dbqjr","False","t1_j3chc2s","/r/AIDungeon/comments/zxp0dk/okay_ive_been_out_of_the_loop_a_while_i_have_a/j3dbqjr/","1676186519","1","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None"

I would recommend trying CharacterAI, creating a private character and setting it up as a narrator/text adventure RPG narrator, etc. You could also describe your character there and give some instructions to the AI (for example, so it would not take actions for the player). 

The problem is that it has no ""real-time"" memory(AID's MEM or AN analog. At least for now.). But, it still kinda remembers pre-configured information and some part of the dialogues. So, you either have to play as an already formed(preconfigured) character or remember the information yourself and periodically remind the AI of some of it during your actions or conversations.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2023-01-07-215656","1673125016","None","False","0","j3dp80g","False","t3_104sh9k","False","t1_j3dp80g","False","t3_104sh9k","/r/AIDungeon/comments/104sh9k/i_installed_dungeonai_but_its_fairly/j3dp80g/","1676186189","6","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None"

It doesn't happen much mind you. When you try to make such things happen it usually doesn't get it. It does happen though. The AI has more than enough material its learned from.

Usually just ends with stabbing or a confused reality break trip to the supermarket.

Do you want to use it like your own personal RPG, use it to generate wacky scenarios and text, or do you want to use it for NSFW crap?

If you want it to be an RPG, just remember that you'll probably have to edit it a lot. It will frequently forget things you have in your inventory, companions you have, or sometimes it just gets stuck in a rut and you have to make something happen by editing the text, or sometimes I choose the STORY option for writing and say, ""Suddenly, you get attacked by"" and let the AI finish that statement, or ""Finally, you arrive in a town called"", different things like that. It can sometimes create a bit of fun for you, but sometimes you will need to edit for consistency or write something to get it back on track. I also suggest adding all important information to the ""memory"" section. It will still forget some of it, but it helps.

If you want to generate wacky shit, look up other scenarios people have made, and try and use similar text and ideas yourself.

If you want NSFW crap, then just write an intro and get it going. Maybe write a few things related to exactly what you want to go down in the memory section if you're into fetish shit. You still might have to edit posts or put in a few prompts yourself to keep it going, but sometimes it does a really good job.

If you mean like you don't understand the base functions, if you want to perform an action, write it after selecting ""DO"" in the text box, if you want to say something, choose ""SAY"", and if you want to just write something that happens without it necessarily being performed by your character, select ""STORY"".

I suspect it might make the AI break down entirely, but even if it doeesn't it's not what I want.

In a nutshell, I want ""you"" to be used as subject only in passive form. Otherwise it can not be used.

It's a fairly simple request I feel, but the AI is just doing it all the time in a program where I feel that is a serious detriment, and if I were designing something like AI dungeon I would consider it completely unacceptable.

They continue their passionate lovemaking, each thrust bringing them closer and closer to the peak of pleasure. Every move is more intoxicating than the last for them both, until finally, they can no longer contain their desire and both reach the ultimate peak of pleasure.

The man pulls his cock out of her and comes all over her face, his deep sighs of pleasure echoing in her ears. She looks up at him with a satisfied smile, her body still quivering with pleasure, as they both take a moment to revel in the ecstasy of the experience. She then slowly draws her finger through his cum, licking it off her finger with delight.

What I meant was that AID gives you an error or annoys you with errors when you least expect it or at the most interesting place. Plus the error description is as big and almost useless as in the topicstarter's screenshot.

Also the errors themselves are a kinda irony about the current state of AID, maybe even a meme of sorts.

Just look, I took this screenshot a few days ago, when Dragon pissed me off by showing 10 such errors in a row, on a typical fantasy scenario(also, inspired by the topicstarter). Wyvern was giving out such errors in that particular place, too. I've used dropped several scenarios because of the AI nonsense and errors like that. At the same time, some other scenarios work just fine, so I completely don't understand the reason. =)

1. It will not be perfect, you have to get used to correcting and redirecting the AI, correcting,editing,cutting off sections that do not fit the them of where you want it to go, things like it making your character say things outside of your perception of the character, follow up actions, and things like that.  


2. Since it is a text predictor, even with proper prompts things can go haywire and wonky relatively quickly, especially if it hits a snag on a word, or theme and does not let it go, it will sometimes repeat itself, sometimes to great comical effect, other times it can be annoying, that's just something you're going to have to get used to if you use this product. The sooner you accept the above things, the sooner you can get back to tinkering with it.  


3. Using the '**Say**' command can require tweaking if it says more than you want it to, you can also use the '**Do**' action and make your character start off with (example Your character realizes that something is not right before they say ""What the hell is going on here?"") stuff like that, **Story** is for assuming direct control, direct inputs that go directly to the story, the AI continues as if it had done it and it can flow rather nicely once you get better at it.  


4. Make use of the games memory on the right hand side to try and smooth things out, do not use negatives such as 'Such and such character does not have big muscles' the game doesn't handle negatives very well and it'll try to bring up your muscles or someone else's muscles if you have that in the memory.  


5. You can fine tune it even more with the section underneath the notes, things like narrative style, very important factors in your story, like calling it , Descriptive, Gritty, Humorous and countless other descriptors that you could think of for your current playthrough, it might not make it perfect, and there is a 300 character limit for the bottom one, but it can certainly help with the tone of what you're doing, it will still require you to get familiar with it and work with it, within it, for a smooth and enjoyable experience.  


I enjoy working with it, it can get you better at roleplaying, work on your writing, should you try to improve and adjust for better responses, teach you new words or sayings, genuinely surprising you, it's not perfect, but if also seen as a writing aid with some feedback, it can be very enjoyable.

Nothing really changes. And it feels like I've been becoming a better writer because of how many times i have to keep it on track. 

It also feels as though it gets down throttled, since dragon has moments where it generates an insane amount of amazing writing. It's to the point i stop playing because a day later it doesn't know how to handle basic concepts.

With Griffin, yes. It only understands so much. Wyvern can handle a bit more complexity, but Dragon can seemingly do anything... assuming it feels like it.

&gt;2. Is it kind of intense that the fine print says they own everything, fully, forever, and don't you dare take something you write here and try to make something of your own with it?

Not really. It's a useful game to toy with, but even at its best, AiDungeon isn't too great at giving stories a real plot or theme. At least, not one that's long enough to he worthy of production.

&gt;Any n00b tutorials y'all recommend? I found a document that will be really helpful for understanding WI and stuff, but not until i really grasp the basics.

Some tips:
1. You can use ""Do"" commands to do multiple things at once.

 Ex: ""I jump onto the train and order my men to detach the train car""

9/10 times the Ai will treat it as if you did both simultaneously. You can use this to add context to your actions: ""I lie and say ""I don't have time this evening"".""

2. You can use the Adventure Memory to store ANY persistent info that is specific to your story. I usually use it to save my character description (""you are Bob, a male knight""). I also entered current quests or goals, adventure specific lore, ally descriptions, and major world events. The difference between Memory and World Info is that Memory data seems to get referenced in almost every response. So if something relevant is there, the Ai will use it. The result is that it helps your story be more consistent.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2023-01-18-221607","1674076567","None","False","0","j4x0xt9","False","t3_10fafey","False","t1_j4x0xt9","False","t3_10fafey","/r/AIDungeon/comments/10fafey/goodbye_sleep_hello_ai_dungeon/j4x0xt9/","1676135152","9","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None",""

And that was when the free AI was actually smart. So yeah it blew my mind when I first used it. It's all I played for almost a year.

1. Yes I dumb down my entries 'cuz the AI gets easily confused. But yeah keep in mind it'll copy your writing style.

2. I agree that the fine print is stupid but I'm certain you can write a better story than what AI Dungeon churns out. Seriously doubt that'd be an issue. Also keep your good stories to yourself if this concerns you is my suggestion.

3. I never use ""Say"" or ""Do"". I only use ""Story"". The AI gets less confused about what you want to happen. Don't forget to type ""You"" for anything you want yourself to do personally.

Also the memory works the best for keeping track of characters and locations. If you find the AI keeps bringing something up too often I suggest erasing it from the memory.

My first line in the memory is always ""You are (insert character name). You are the leader of the rebellion"" or something like this. The AI still gets confused but this makes it less likely to confuse you for another character.

If you mean do I sometimes simplify the plot or roll with a smaller cast of characters just so that the AI won't lose track of it so often, then yes. Sometimes I also include something that I think should probably be obvious, just to make sure that the AI remembers it. If you mean grammatical style and vocabulary, then no, I don't dumb it down.

2. Maybe a little bit. They've promised that they will never look in on private stories that you don't publish, but they've gone back on that before when they started banning people based on private stories, but then there was a lot of backlash over that, and they've said that they won't do that again... Let's hope they were being honest. In the end, don't post anything that you wouldn't want to be made public.

3. I don't know about real tutorials. I guess my suggestions would be: A. Don't view it like a game. It is a writing companion. You will frequently find yourself frustrated if you want to use it as an RPG DM because it will have trouble staying focused and consistent. That's not to say you can't have fun with it and leave a lot of points of plot up to the AI, just don't view it as a strict DM. B. (related to point A) Don't be afraid to edit the AI's output to make it more relevant or use the ""story"" option to get the AI going in the right direction. C. If you have a lot of talking and characters in your story, it is a good idea to frequently use the name of whatever character you are addressing. D. If the AI is just spinning its wheels and not really going anywhere, I like to add in phrases like, ""Suddenly, you see"",  ""Finally, you arrive at the town of"", ""X tells you that the reason he has come here to warn you about"", etc. and then let the AI complete it. After you've been playing for a while, you'll start to recognize when it presents new characters or situations and has absolutely no idea where it's going with them and you need to help lead the AI out of those. Sometimes the AI still says something stupid or that just doesn't work with the plot, and I have to make something up myself, or sometimes I just write ""X goes away"" and then I continue the story from where I left off. X might come back, but sometimes it works!","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2023-01-19-001012","1674083412","None","False","0","j4xhoin","False","t3_10fafey","False","t1_j4xhoin","False","t3_10fafey","/r/AIDungeon/comments/10fafey/goodbye_sleep_hello_ai_dungeon/j4xhoin/","1676134722","7","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None",""

On the other hand, I feel like it's been broken. I'll try to explain what the problem is.

In most of my scenarios, the AI very quickly comes to the point where it generates an error (Sorry, the AI is stumped.), or tries to generate bullshit there, or short replies. And I absolutely do not understand what causes it, because the scenarios themselves are relatively simple without NSFW content. And, strangely enough, the problem is more with Dragon, a little less with Wyvern. But, my other part of the scenarios -  works pretty ok, so IDK. Things get even sadder when I copy the entire scenario into Kobold 12-20B and... It generates replies without any problems. It's so confusing...

The second problem is that often the AI tends to reduce the dialogues to short answers and then goes into a loop. The AI settings don't help much...

There *is* still a filter for pedophilic content, but it's nowhere near as bad as it used to be and only applies to the AI's outputs (that is to say, your inputs can't trigger the filter and if the AI generates an output that triggers the filter, it'll simply generate a different output that *doesn't*). You can no longer be banned for stuff you do in private adventures.

Anyways:

1. [KoboldAI](https://koboldai.org/) (+[KoboldAI Google Colab](https://koboldai.org/colab/), for if you can't/don't want to run KoboldAI locally) exists and is pretty much objectively better than free AID in every aspect other than convenience.

2. The [Alpa OPT-175B demo](https://opt.alpa.ai/) exists. It's pretty barebones in terms of features, but it certainly exists.

3. [TextSynth](https://textsynth.com/playground.html) also exists. Although, it's also very barebones in terms of features. It also has a rate limit for free users.

4. [Dreamily](https://dreamily.ai/) exists. Unlike the previous two, it has a decent amount of features, and it's... alright, I guess.

5. [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) and [CharacterAI](https://beta.character.ai/) both exist. They both easily outperform AID in terms of output quality, although they're mainly intended to be used as chatbot applications. However, they're pretty awful in terms of privacy, and they're both censored (CharacterAI filters NSFW content, ChatGPT filters for [all of this stuff](https://beta.openai.com/docs/usage-policies)), so I assume they're not exactly what you're looking for.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2023-01-20-011942","1674173982","None","1674174269.0","0","j52t5mk","False","t3_10gfzu7","False","t1_j52t5mk","False","t3_10gfzu7","/r/AIDungeon/comments/10gfzu7/are_there_any_free_alternatives/j52t5mk/","1676129805","10","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None",""

If the survey shows this is a widespread issue, we'll do a deeper diagnosis. The solution for this is likely better training data or player settings. Not filters or anything like that.

I have no idea, I just remember it didn't have too many reviews on Google Play and decided to try it out because it had a beta-tester option. I had an adventure with over 2,000 inputs, and I played it nearly everyday. The energy system annoyed me but I had a workaround where I'd just leave my phone on at home so I could passively overcharge while I was at school. I wasn't really in the loop with anything as AI Dungeon rose and fell, so things were happening that I just had to get used to. I had no idea the game had blown up, I had no idea that so much was happening, all I knew was the AI was making worse and worse generations and I basically have to go and edit every input to get any coherent event now. It's premium was getting more and more added, now there were different AI models which I could never access because of premium, then premium was split into different forms, then I saw special currency which really worried me, and god the game itself, even on browser, is so laggy, unresponsive, slow. Things will load then collapse on their own, it'll take half a minute to open a scenario or world page just to check it out, the AI itself will take years to respond, and even when it does it doesn't give a good response. Sometimes it'll just duplicate my command for whatever reason, or copy-paste what my command says into a response. It was really disheartening seeing the game become so glitchy and in some cases terrible. And when I finally decided to figure out why, I got even more sad over all the controversy because the game was so good, I miss it so much. I still play it on and off while trying to find other games that satisfy my itch, but I'm going to have to drop it soon enough.

Loved the game, wish I stood in the loop of things so I could back the fanbase when I could, and it's kind of hard to uninstall the game since I've had so much fun with it.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2023-01-22-072415","1674368655","None","False","0","j5dqalh","False","t3_xzt0gb","False","t1_j5dqalh","True","t1_irp2iqo","/r/AIDungeon/comments/xzt0gb/this_sub_has_made_me_question_my_enjoyment_of_ai/j5dqalh/","1676119787","2","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None",""

And to clarify, the AI is worse because Latitude (the company behind AID) switched models. This is because OpenAI, the company that used to provide their AI models, began enforcing heavier censorship beyond just the pedophilia filter to enforce their [content policy](https://beta.openai.com/docs/usage-policies). This also resulted in fewer users using the OpenAI models, causing Latitude to lose the volume-based discount that they once had on OpenAI's models. OpenAI was also responsible for outsourcing the moderation of private AID stories to strangers on the internet through a website called Taskup, without Latitude's knowledge or permission, resulting in over 100 private stories being leaked on 4chan.

To answer your question from your comment, scales are used to temporarily speed up the rate at which the AI generates outputs. I don't think they have any other use at the moment, but they also aren't new; they've been around since late 2020 (although their uses were different back then). Credits are used to generate images (yes, AID has image generation now) and can also be exchanged for scales. One last thing to note: AI Dungeon isn't *necessarily* the best application of its kind anymore (back in early 2021, the alternatives were all either heavily censored, very pricey, or significantly weaker than AID). There are several notable, and arguably better, similar applications at this point.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2023-01-23-060828","1674450508","None","1674454618.0","0","j5id5qa","False","t3_10j38ow","False","t1_j5id5qa","False","t3_10j38ow","/r/AIDungeon/comments/10j38ow/is_ai_dungeon_good_again_now/j5id5qa/","1676115638","59","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None",""

[NovelAI](https://novelai.net/) is often considered the best paid alternative to AID. Bottom line, it has far more features and customization than AID, better image generation (at least for anime and furry stuff, anyways), and AI models that are often considered to be comparable to or better than AID's best models.

2. [Sudowrite](https://www.sudowrite.com/) is the only GPT-3 Davinci application that I know of that *doesn't* have OpenAI's filter. Apparently, the creators of Sudowrite have some deal with OpenAI that allows them to get away with only filtering astroturfing. However, the subscriptions are kinda pricey and you don't get unlimited use. It also lacks some features that are common among AID and the other alternatives on this list; although it *does* still have a few cool features that you don't see with most AI applications.

3. [KoboldAI](https://koboldai.org/) (+[KoboldAI Google Colab](https://koboldai.org/colab/) and [KoboldAI Lite](https://lite.koboldai.net/), for if you can't/don't want to run KoboldAI locally) is free and is pretty much objectively better than free AID in nearly aspect. And also, it's the only alternative that I know to have multiplayer. The main downside, at least, if you're running KAI locally or using the Colab, is convenience.

4. [HoloAI](https://writeholo.com/) is mostly notable for being cheaper than NovelAI. It's somewhat worse than NAI in nearly every aspect, but its subscription tiers only cost about half as much as their NAI counterparts.

5. The [Alpa OPT-175B demo](https://opt.alpa.ai/) exists. It's pretty barebones in terms of features, but it's free.

6. [TextSynth](https://textsynth.com/playground.html) is free. Although, it's also very barebones in terms of features. It also has a rate limit for free users.

7. [Dreamily](https://dreamily.ai/) is another free alternative. Unlike the previous two, it has a decent amount of features, and it's... alright, I guess. At the very least, there are a decent amount of people who prefer it over free AID

8. [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/). You likely already know about ChatGPT, but to summarize, it's a free and *very* powerful AI chatbot application. However, it's made by OpenAI, so it uses OpenAI's filter and isn't exactly great in terms of privacy. Still notable for being free and giving better outputs than pretty much any of AID's models.

9. [CharacterAI](https://beta.character.ai/). Again, you likely already know about this one. Similarly to ChatGPT, it's a free AI chatbot application that's censored (although the censorship *quite* isn't as severe as OpenAI's; as far as I know, it's just NSFW content, although I also recently heard it has issues with swear words now? Unsure if that's true, haven't yet checked) and that's also pretty bad when it comes to privacy.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2023-01-23-074649","1674456409","None","1674463364.0","0","j5im7fz","False","t3_10j38ow","False","t1_j5im7fz","False","t1_j5ijtuz","/r/AIDungeon/comments/10j38ow/is_ai_dungeon_good_again_now/j5im7fz/","1676115414","40","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None",""

You likely already do as it's been pretty popular, but in case you don't, it's a free chatbot-style AI application. Although, since it's made by OpenAI, it uses OpenAI's filter and is not exactly great when it comes to privacy. And also, a small correction: You say in the post that there's no info on what model Sudowrite uses (maybe that was true at the time Sudowrite was added to the list, but it isn't anymore). It uses GPT-3 Davinci.

And on an aside, I've noticed that the list hasn't been updated to include CharacterAI, Alpa, and such. Fair enough, given that you don't seem to have a ton of time for looking into alternatives and updating the list and all. So I just wanted to ask, would you mind if I made an updated version of the list myself? People still ask for alternatives on the AID sub fairly frequently, and it's a lot easier to just link a big list of alternatives than it is to manually write out paragraphs of info every time; *but*, in its current state, the list is kinda outdated.

Went over and read a small chunk of stuff over there, it is very familiar.  
It's sad to see something like that again.  
Brings back legitimately sad feelings and memories as I was heavily invested in this when the original bad stuff happened.  
Here, things are getting better, but there have been some growing pains (significant growing pains, I am putting it lightly even saying that) and I wish that AIDungeon and it's people continue to get better.  
I am happy with this product currently.  
\\---  
Reading over there, just as people were reading on this sub, Is great for newer people on what not to do, both PR wise and Filter wise.  
I love giving long winded responses to things,yet right now I'm glad that this place has seemingly gotten over that hurdle, and is trying to build it back up.  
\\---  
I will always be skeptical, once bitten twice shy and all that, but I'll continue to do my best to help when I can, if I can.  
It's strange but I feel very emotional even talking about the Drama, things got so heated, I felt so heated that I really just want to move forward and put it behind me, seeing another make those mistakes, either virtue signalling or whatever their exact reasons are, I feel moved away from sympathy, yet I do not wish to feel jaded.  
If I'm projecting, or simply remembering, filling in the gaps with hope for myself, or just lying to myself, I hope for the best, maybe that is a lie I am also telling myself?  
\\---  
My life is getting better, and I can view this from a better vantage point, but it is still a strange soft spot for me, that understanding doesn't necessarily make feel any better.  
\\---  
I really cannot know, all people are strange and unpredictable, and even knowing what's going to happen, or seeing similar patterns, you might be inclined to make a bet, a safe bet even, could be good, could be bad, right or wrong.  
I guess this is cathartic or something, maybe not?

They’ve since switched AI providers and now apparently stories aren’t viewed and your account can’t get banned from private stories. The filter is heavily altered now. It doesn’t seem to be overbearing and if it does trip, it simply will give an error and not generate unless you manually alter whatever triggered it instead of locking you out and getting your stuff read.
