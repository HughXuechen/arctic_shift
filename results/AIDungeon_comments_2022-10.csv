The image in the post is from a review of the mug made back in December of 2021.

Edit: Also, what's up with all the downvotes on this person's comment? Their suspicion is reasonable.

Edit 2: OP has done it. Posted a shady link in response to one user who asked for it, I mean. While on the topic, the user who asked for the link also seems kinda suspect, given that, similarly to OP, their account is a week old and only started being active about 10 hours ago. They also have similar usernames (their usernames are both a large portion of a word, with a few random letters at the end). Their comment also makes no sense in the context of the post, given that the title implies that OP made the mug and/or the artwork; not that OP purchased the mug from some website.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-10-01-022120","1664583680","None","1664594907.0","0","iqkg8rk","False","t3_xsgnv4","False","t1_iqkg8rk","True","t1_iqkfzyp","/r/AIDungeon/comments/xsgnv4/im_so_pleased_with_how_it_came_out/iqkg8rk/","1664960487","6","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None"

And then it disappears.

There are cries of dismay as what was once one of the greatest AI platforms on the internet vanishes. It had just returned to its glory, even if it became the older version with the classic pixel font soon after. More posts are made, with old users complaining about Latitude for deleting the app after making it great again. Outrage posts are being made like it was 2021 again. A great sigh of disappointment ripples throughout the community. Maybe the game was destined to fall after all. The majority quickly abandons AI Dungeon, moving to Dreamily or NovelAI or some other similar app, with a few people still hopefully checking the website for some form of life. Eventually, everyone moves on. It’s over. One person occasionally checks the website, looking back at it nostalgically. There were fun times and bad times, but it was a journey nonetheless. Until one day. A user types in the domain. And it loads. They stare at the screen, waiting for it to flash with “Would you like to purchase this domain?”

But that screen never comes. The user slams their hands against the desk. Is the website back? Is it better than ever? The website loads, revealing the first build from the 5th of December, 2019.

Part one covers writing styles

Part two covers mood and tone and all of that.

https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/q6ef4z/guide_to_ai_dungeon_styles_part_2/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

Almost all of this came from other people. All I did was do my best to trim it down and simplify it.

You can combine two writing styles, but it doesn't always work so well. Adding more wouldn't help.

But besides the writing style you can set the tone of the scene and tell it what's happening or what's going to happen in the scene.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-10-03-021716","1664756236","None","False","0","iqtmton","False","t3_xtvk9z","False","t1_iqtmton","False","t3_xtvk9z","/r/AIDungeon/comments/xtvk9z/writing_styles/iqtmton/","1668003790","4","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None",""

If you *actually* mean a scenario, then I can't really think of a solution. Normally, it's basically impossible for a scenario to use so much text for it to be laggy from the moment you start it.

When you create a world and input an info, its input is locked so that you can't accidentally do anything wrong. Once you input an info, it's also saved in world info page and you CAN'T change the entry in however way from the world edit page except for the description, key, and maybe name.

So how to edit the info in ""edit world"" page? There is a edit symbol just beside the pointer. Hit it and the characters will look different. Don't forget to save it after editing the ""description."" Note that this doesn't affect the entry of related ""world info"" and even if you delete the info in ""edit world"" page, it doesn't automatically remove the related world info entry which is why every time you input an info, it gets saved as a world info, it triples up if you put there thrice regardless of deletion.

Also, don't forget to hit ""save"" buttons always after editing. Every world info entry and every"" edit world"" description has an individual save button. Then there also is a ""save"" option for your entire world. That's at the right top just beside the world symbol on the last page which is ""summary"" page.

Edit: guess I explained the wrong category. Anyway, things like ""genre,"" in world info entry are only attributes. So if you backspace everything in an attribute entry, the attribute label also disappears, I guess. However, genre only matters in world info generation and NOT entry itself so it doesn't matter anymore after you have generated the entry.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-10-05-004832","1664923712","None","1664924019.0","0","ir2w6bb","False","t3_xvr4mu","False","t1_ir2w6bb","False","t3_xvr4mu","/r/AIDungeon/comments/xvr4mu/try_creating_my_new_world_the_app_is_so_buggy_and/ir2w6bb/","1667993629","4","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None",""

"[]","False","None","ImpactBilby","1506892657","None","None","[]","None","None","None","text","t2_f7nysp4","False","False","I had a reasonably fun survival horror story involving one of my OCs once.

It started with her being kidnapped by a mad doctor sort of character who turned out to be a serial killer and satanic cultist. As she was being held prisoner inside a hospital and then an underground complex, she was given a bit of lore involving cards as a form of psychoanalysis, and then was forced to euthanize another patient. She had to escape from the villain by hiding inside various cabinets as he was distracted talking to a fox-person, then taking a series of elevators to various locations. She ended up running into the zombie version of the guy she euthanized who she re-killed by pressing a button that made him into a shower of blood. Then, she had to fight with a random dog and a menacing villain, both of which turned out to be curbstomps. She also snapped and repeatedly tried killing the villain, who'd come back within seconds. There was an ominous scene involving a ghost who claimed to be her future self that warned her not to go to the North Pole on December 25th or Santa will kill her (?). There was a time where the narration specifically mentioned the mad scientist having bandages on his arm, and my girl asked about it. It wasn't anything spooky, it turned out he was just a carpenter in his spare time.

By the way, said OC was a bunnygirl who repeatedly insulted the doctor and everything around her, snarking about the things the AI threw at her. There were some running gags, like her getting angry about the AI misnaming her. This, combined with the curbstomping and stuff like the Santa thing gave the whole story more of a horror comedy vibe.

It ended with her escaping and realizing the lair was under a hotel restaurant. After she returned home, she learned the villain kidnapped and killed her dad, which resulted in her taking a gun from her house and marching back to the lab, where she shot the villain and made sure to burn the corpse (twice!). Some old friends (who weren't mentioned before) showed up and told her ""we were brainwashed, he used our powers for evil, we need to stop him!"" Then everyone resolved to kick his rear because he wasn't going to stay dead, with the narration specifically noting she had a mission now.

I had to stop there. It was too much of a perfect ending to this madness.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-10-08-060425","1665201865","None","1665202198.0","0","irhea6i","False","t3_xxb5tj","False","t1_irhea6i","True","t3_xxb5tj","/r/AIDungeon/comments/xxb5tj/when_was_the_last_time_you_had_genuine_non/irhea6i/","1667978274","1","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None",""

we start out with the child-porn filter good idea in principle (though it can be debated), terrible execution. Everything was censored wanting to get 2 beers? censored because of the number anything below 18 was censored.
Thereafter the majority of people learned it was a demand from OpenAI for using their AIs.
We also learn of a serious dataleak which exposed how much porn was generated in AIDungeon.
During all this you couldn't play scenarios or worlds other people made, that's back now though much more limited.
Latitude decide to cut ties with OpenAI for cost and fans sake which resulted in what most would consider a downgrade of the AIs, add competition in form of novelAI and AIDungeon started to face economic problems.
Next we have the energy and can't say much about that as I never ran out, though allegedly it would take more than 24 hours to refill.
Then we have cut backs unused systems again to save money. 
We did get 2D AIDungeon pixelart which was interesting. 
Later Latitude made a survey regarding ads and decided to add ads to the game which interrupted gameplay though only for free users. 

When again the backlash became too much they decided to make an ad-skip (only accessible in beta-testing) where you watch multiple ads to avoid ads while playing. 
One 30 second ad equals 10 actions, meaning something do/say/story and something the ai do (as long as it's not directly after your action) and redo are all actions. Now you can use scales to buy actions.
They are also mostly ignoring bug reports.

April 26th of 2021, Latitude, the company behind AI Dungeon, implemented a filter for private adventures. They [officially announced the filter](https://latitude.io/blog/update-to-our-community-ai-test-april-2021) the next day. Latitude claimed the filter was *only* supposed to filter pedophilic content (although there was a pretty obvious attempt to filter bestiality as well, as the filter had issues with animals). At the time the filter was added, it was just laughably bad. Mentioning a child, or an animal, or a number below 18, or a sexual term, regardless of the context, triggered the filter when it was first added. The devs also said they'd be monitoring private stories that triggered the filter, which was seen as a privacy violation given how faulty the filter was. There was also nothing preventing the AI from giving outputs that the filter would disallow.

Latitude made some changes to the filter early on. The first major changes were the removal of the censorship of animals, and the change to a two-column filter, where you'd have to use one of the censored words relating to minors, *and* one of the censored words relating to sex, within the last 400 or so characters of the story to trigger the filter. The term ""pedoph"" (and any words containing the term) was an outlier, as it would trigger the filter on it's own, without any other censored words having to be present.

The filter still wasn't good after that, though, since it was, of course, incapable of understanding context. The way they went about filtering also meant that it was incredibly easy for people actually using the AI for pedophilic content to avoid the filter if they knew how. It also meant that words containing censored terms could trigger the filter. As some examples: ""Infantry"" (contained ""infant""), ""breastplate"" (contained ""breast""), ""analysis"" (contained ""anal""), ""cocky"" and ""cockpit"" (both contained ""cock""), ""boyfriend"" and ""girlfriend"" (contained ""boy"" and ""girl"", respectively), etc. Latitude, within a couple of weeks of the filter's existence, also added an automated suspension system that would sometimes automatically suspend players for triggering the filter for up to a week.

It was also [found that AI Dungeon's finetuning data contained some pedophilic content](https://gitgud.io/AuroraPurgatio/aurorapurgatio), which made the AI more likely to output pedophilic content, itself, and which a lot of users saw as being hypocritical.

Additionally, there was a [data breach](https://github.com/AetherDevSecOps/aid_adventure_vulnerability_report) that occured about 2 weeks prior to the filter controversy, and that the AI Dungeon community only found out about during the controversy. It apparently allowed for all private content, except for private content from the first 11 days of AI Dungeon 2's existence, to be accessed. Latitude failed to disclose the breach for months, which people were understandably upset about. It wasn't until 5 months after the breach occurred that [Latitude finally disclosed the breach](https://latitude.io/blog/data-incident-april-2021).

There was also the issue of the moderation of private stories being outsourced to strangers on the internet via a website called ""Taskup"". As a result of this outsourcing, over 100 private stories ended up being leaked on 4chan. To be fair, it [later came to light that the outsourcing was the doing of OpenAI (the company that used to provide Latitude with their AI models), rather than Latitude's doing](https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/pze72g/updated_related_to_taskup_questions/), but that was unknown for months, and regardless of who was responsible for the outsourcing, people were still upset about such a breach of privacy.

Aside from that, during the controversy, several features of AI Dungeon were either made worse, or removed entirely. The ""Explore"" feature, which allowed users to share prompts and stories, and to communicate with one another, was also removed just 2 weeks before the controversy started. That definitely wasn't the cause of the controversy, but it added fuel to the fire regardless. It also didn't help that Latitude went radio silent for most of the controversy.

Eventually, Latitude ditched OpenAI. This was because of a combination of reasons. Firstly, OpenAI began enforcing heavy censorship for their models that disallowed violent content and general sexual content, among other things. Secondly, as a result of some users no longer using the OpenAI AI models as a result of said censorship, Latitude ended up losing the volume-based discount that they previously had for OpenAI's models, meaning that the AI was now significantly more expensive for Latitude to use than before. Thirdly, OpenAI is generally a shitty company and was, as I said before, responsible for over 100 private stories being leaked on 4chan. So, now AI Dungeon uses AI models from AI21. Unfortunately, though, the current AI models are pretty much unanimously considered to be worse than the old ones from OpenAI.

For clarification, the filter still exists, but is nowhere near as bad as it was during the controversy. At this point in time, there is no longer a suspension system, and with [Latitude's shift to the ""Walls Approach""](https://latitude.io/blog/the-walls-approach), the filter now only applies to the AI. Latitude also claimed they'd no longer be manually reviewing stuff that triggers the filter. The ""Explore"" page is also back, now called ""Search"". Although it's... kinda worse than before since the Posts section and the ""Top"" sorting option were both removed, for some reason.

There was some controversy a few months ago regarding the addition of ads. Prior to ads being implemented, AI Dungeon had been using an energy system for over a year, and the energy had a high enough limit and recharge rate that most users were unhindered by it. When ads were first implemented, you'd get a pop-up ad every 10 or so actions. However, a lot of users ended up disliking this system, as they found the ads to be too intrusive, long, and/or frequent.

Latitude justified the implementation of ads by saying that ads were a highly requested feature. That claim *was* true, but the people who requested for ads to be implemented mainly either wanted ads to restore energy, wanted the option to watch ads for some sort of benefit, or wanted banner ads; people didn't ask for the type of ads that Latitude initially implemented. Anyways, Latitude ended up switching to the current system in which you can watch ads to get 10 actions per ad, and can stockpile actions before playing instead of having to be constantly interrupted by ads while playing. Even with the new ad system, though, there's still a fairly large portion of the community that's unhappy with the ads.

More recently, in August, there was also [another data breach](https://help.aidungeon.io/faq/s3-buckets-15aug22). [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/wqofq7/qa_with_latitude_after_august_2022_data_breach/) is an archive of the Q&amp;A Latitude had about the breach.

Anyways (this part of the comment isn't part of the copypasta), as for good free alternatives, [KoboldAI](https://koboldai.org/) is your best bet. And here's the [Google Colab](https://koboldai.org/colab/) for if you can't/don't want to run AI models locally. It has models available that are, at the very least, pretty much outright better than AID's current Griffin and Wyvern models. Additionally, it has the most features you're going to get with a free alternative. Some people also like [Dreamily](https://dreamily.ai/). I'd say Dreamily is better than KoboldAI in terms of convenience, and is at least better than AID's Griffin model, but KoboldAI is still better in basically every aspect other than convenience. Also, [TextSynth](https://textsynth.com/) exists. More powerful AI models than Dreamily, more convenience than KoboldAI. However, it's very barebones in terms of features, and has a rate limit for free users. The models also aren't *quite* as good as KoboldAI's due to them not being finetuned.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-10-09-101212","1665303132","None","1665303650.0","0","irm139n","False","t3_xzed11","False","t1_irm139n","False","t3_xzed11","/r/AIDungeon/comments/xzed11/can_someone_catch_me_up_to_date/irm139n/","1667973394","26","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None",""

**TLDR: People who hate it are justified in their hate | New users enjoy the product because they don't know how good it was and how far it has fallen | If you enjoy it, keep enjoying it and let others hate it 😊**

You say that you have been playing for about a year, so you missed the big blow-up, the chaos, and the frankly abhorrent way Latitude treated it's customers.

As a relative newbie you are also not experiencing what the AI was before the fiasco occurred. Your experience is based on how things are now. So you look at this and go ""Wow, this is pretty good."" and you're right - things are good. But AID is a shadow of what it used to be. It used to be great.

Imagine if it was suddenly announced that everyone in the world gets just 1 hour of internet a day. There would be rioting, hate, public unrest, etc. Now wait for a generation to pass and then everyone being told that you can have 2 hours. The young generation would be ""OMG, this is amazing, 2 hours of internet! How can you still be grumpy grandpa?

This is how I see new people enjoying the product. Yeah, AID still alright, but it's a lobotomised shadow of it's former self and doesn't hold the magic it once did. I also wouldn't trust Latitude with my data ever again.

I would also add that AID used to considered (one of) the best on the market. Now it is just one amongst many, and it isn't even near the top of that pile any more.

But at the end of the day, if you are enjoying it then that's great. That's all that matters. Some people will hate, some people will feel betrayed, some people will move on, some will never know what happened and live a life of bliss.

It's a lot easier to understand why AID is so disliked if you're a long-time player. Without having experienced 2020/early 2021 AID, you aren't really going to understand why AID is supposedly so much worse than it used to be.

To keep it somewhat short (this part is mainly for if OP sees this comment, so that they can maybe get a better understanding of why this sub complains about AID so much), in the past year and a half, numerous features were removed or made worse, AID started using worse AI models, and the application, for some reason, became far more prone to random errors. And, with development of AID having slowed down immensely, for whatever reason, it isn't really seeming like AID is going to return to being a top-tier AI application, nor does it seem like the numerous issues with the site are going to be fixed any time soon.

Latitude also lost a lot of customer trust, mainly due to going radio silent for months during the controversy, failing to disclose a data breach for months, and simply not being transparent with the community. AID now having actual competition (their ""competition"" back in 2020 and early 2021 was just overpriced and heavily censored GPT-3 applications, along with GPT-2 and GPT-Neo applications that had much worse outputs) also serves to make AID's issues more apparent, and means that AID no longer completely outperforms similar applications.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-10-10-015054","1665359454","None","False","0","irp7i64","False","t3_xzt0gb","False","t1_irp7i64","False","t1_irp2iqo","/r/AIDungeon/comments/xzt0gb/this_sub_has_made_me_question_my_enjoyment_of_ai/irp7i64/","1667970014","29","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None",""

Yes, but there were alternative models. AID wanted that 175 billion parameter model so it could stand up and say that their model was the best out there so their product must be the best. They didn't want to go with an *'inferior'* model because money. At the end of the day, Latitude cared more about money than their integrity or their followers.

Eventually though, as you point out, Latitude had to drop OpenAI and the *'superior'* model anyway. The irony.

&gt;The sad part is these new models, while they are (mostly) unfiltered, are inferior to GPT-Davinci

Absolutely. The models you see used on other AI writers are no where near as powerful. Neither is the current AID model however. In fact, I think the current AID dungeon model is inferior to most other platforms right now? (Can someone confirm or correct me on this?).

I think what AID proved however is that you can have all the power, but how you implement it really matters. AID from the golden days relied on it's many billions of parameters to be good, IMO. Many newer products have shown that they can compete with weaker models because they are better trained.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-10-10-021339","1665360819","None","False","0","irpa9ix","False","t3_xzt0gb","False","t1_irpa9ix","False","t1_irp7zjm","/r/AIDungeon/comments/xzt0gb/this_sub_has_made_me_question_my_enjoyment_of_ai/irpa9ix/","1667969932","4","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None",""

The main problem is that the AI is significantly worse than it once was. And to clarify, I don't blame Latitude for ditching OpenAI; I think they made the right decision, but they haven't really made any attempts to optimize their current AI models to get the best performance out of them like similar applications have.

Also, several features were removed or made worse, and AID is now more prone to random errors and features randomly breaking than ever before. AID is notably worse than before in almost every aspect, and for the past year or so, it hasn't felt like Latitude has been making much of an effort to actually improve the application.

Interesting. Back when you made the [announcement](https://latitude.io/blog/more-dragon-updates) on New Year's Eve 2021, you said you were giving up on GPT-3 only because they raised their prices on you above what your company could afford. Not a word was said about you disagreeing with their approach to filtering content. Surely that would have been a very good thing to mention from a PR perspective?

Even Latitude, themselves, have admitted that the current AI models aren't quite as good as the old OpenAI models. The paid AI models are better than the free one, of course, but still just not on the same level of quality as the OpenAI Dragon model. You can also just test the AI models for yourself and come to your own conclusions; Griffin is still free, and there's a free trial for AID premium. Out of the premium models, Wyvern-Hydra is the best, in my opinion. That seems to be generally agreed upon by the community, and Latitude has also said that Wyvern-Hydra is currently the model that performs the best.

Although, I'd also recommend checking out some of the alternatives before deciding on whether or not AID premium is worth your money. [NovelAI](https://novelai.net/) is generally considered to be the best paid alternative, and it isn't any more expensive than AID premium. [Sudowrite](https://www.sudowrite.com/) uses GPT-3 Davinci (the AI model that Dragon *used* to use), without the heavy censorship of other GPT-3 Davinci applications. Although, it's a bit lacking in terms of features, and the pricing is a bit ridiculous. Also, NovelAI and Sudowrite both have free trials. [KoboldAI](https://koboldai.org/) (+[KoboldAI Google Colab link](https://koboldai.org/colab/)) is generally considered to be the best free alternative, and at the very least, it's basically objectively better than free AID in every aspect other than convenience.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-10-11-035200","1665453120","None","1665453496.0","0","iru7dfw","False","t3_y0w2tn","False","t1_iru7dfw","False","t3_y0w2tn","/r/AIDungeon/comments/y0w2tn/is_it_that_bad/iru7dfw/","1667964685","9","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None",""

**Next Steps on AI Dungeon**

We’ve been talking to many of our players about their experience on AI Dungeon and have received lots of great feedback. We’re grateful to all the users who have shared their suggestions with us.

We identified some common themes from the feedback, and they’ll become the focus of our work for the next few months.

**1. Stability**

Many of our players have been understandably disappointed by bugs, app crashes, and downtime they’ve encountered while playing. No one likes when they’re excited to play a game or continue building their story only to encounter an annoying bug or lose some progress.

We’ve already completed several key rewrites to address code that isn’t stable when we’re patching. But despite these improvements, users still experience far more issues than desired, and we realize we haven’t done enough yet.

Here are some of the areas we already improved or have plans to change to improve stability:

[*Im not gonna fk w trying to format this part, click through if you want it*]

**2. Ads**

We’ve heard the feedback that ads have been frustrating for many players. Ads are the latest solution we’ve implemented to support a free version of AI Dungeon (energy before). We’ve learned a lot about how ads work and are exploring the next steps to improve how we support free play.

We’ve been running several experiments to better understand the impact of ads on the free experience. We’ve tested fewer ads, removing ads, increasing the number of actions awarded, and different types of ads. Our goal is to have a clear understanding of what an optimal free experience looks like and how ads should play a part in that.

We’re still early in the process, so we don’t have a specific solution ready to share today. In the meantime, we’re working to address two consistent issues players have: 1. Ads don’t load, and 2. Ads don’t consistently reward actions. We will share results as we continue to experiment and appreciate continued feedback.

**3. Authentication (new login)**

Some players have shared continued issues with our login system. Functionality has been inconsistent across the platforms we support, especially on the Android app. We recently launched a new system based on Firebase Authentication (backed by Google), which has already been a much more stable experience for players. In this new system, players will now need to authenticate using email (we can’t support username login anymore). We have also ended support of Steam login.

If you need help figuring out your email because you normally logged in with your username please send us an email at support@aidungeon.io and include your username and anything else that can help us verify your account.

Steam purchases can still be linked to your AI Dungeon account to verify the purchase, and your Steam benefits can still be enjoyed on all platforms you use.

**4. AI Quality**

Better model quality continues to be one of the most requested improvements by players. We’ve recently put renewed focus on improving the models that power AI Dungeon and the data used to train them, which will help solve issues and improve the general experience for every player. Here’s what we’ve been working on and have planned:

(done) Wyvern as a new model

(done) Hydra mode for Griffin + Wyvern

(done) Improved AI Feedback

(beta) Doubled context length for Wyvern (2048 tokens)

(beta) New 3rd person finetune dataset

(alpha) Updated 2nd person finetune dataset

(planned) Story Styles

Story Styles will tune the AI to a specific genre (fantasy, romance, and historical fiction), fictional universe (such as those featuring superheroes, space adventures, or even vampire and werewolf love stories), or writing style (like Jane Austen or Mark Twain).

Not only will we be creating a set of Story Styles, but players will be able to create their own Story Styles. We can't wait to see what you come up with!

Wyvern-Hydra continues to perform as our leading model in both our Train the AI experiments and according to player preference. Please continue to submit feedback about the language model's performance using the AI Feedback button in AI Dungeon. Also, join our Discord server and let us know what your experience is like with the updates to Wyvern. We plan to keep making all of our models even better!

** 5. UI / UX Design **

We are especially excited about updating the UI/UX of AI Dungeon. We will be using a component-based library called NativeBase which will provide a more stable app experience. And, given recent survey feedback, we will be making slight updates to the look and feel. Here are some of the early mockups for the designs we’ve been exploring (there will be changes before we launch, but this gives you an early idea of the direction):


We've begun work on this update and will launch it as a new beta instance for early testing when ready.

The one example you have presented (i.e. walls) was never an issue for me. I understood the reasons/motivation for implementing the changes that you did. Although the sudden impact on creativity bled outside your scope, I could get behind this IF someone had said something. I, like many others, woke up one morning to a sweep of changes with no warning whatsoever. When the preverbal hit the fan (which it did very quickly) your company (you) went silent and abandoned your community and your community representatives. This ultimately created an environment to foster the resentment expressed by a lot of people.  
  
The feedback I would offer now is that when things go bad, (and they will go bad, everyone makes mistakes and you will never please everyone), acknowledge people's concerns and manage expectations. You don't have to reply with a knee-jerk response defending or backtracking for what you have done. Just say, *""Ok, we hear you. Let us take the time to respond properly. Please bear with us.""*, and provide regular updates.  
  
I no longer use AID, but I still follow it's development because I find the medium fascinating. I have seen many improvements to the platform that would have enticed me in. So I understand the appeal to new users and those that are ready to forgive.

The paid one can sometimes surprise (if you use AI settings and extra memory), but in general, it is worse than the old one. If you evaluate the situation in terms of price/performance - the ex-gold subscription has become both better and worse. On the one hand it gives you unlimited access to a much better model than the old Griffin(17b vs 6b), but, also, the new Dragon is problematic. Besides, it's the only subscription that can compete with NovelAI ones(more memory+slightly more powerful AI for casual users who are interested in text adventures). The $15 and $30 subscriptions make almost no sense if you are only interested in the text story generator. In addition, there are many strong competitors both paid and free since then.

P.s. Oh, I forgot, there is also a Steam version (analog of the former Silver subscription, but a one-time payment). In the long run, it has a very interesting price.

You don't have the perspective of having experienced AI Dungeon during its prime, and it also doesn't sound like you've tried any of the alternatives.

It's possible to enjoy AID, especially if it's the only application of its kind that you've tried, which sounds like the case for you. Personally, I thought AID was great even when it used GPT-2. However, looking back on my old GPT-2 stories and testing out the GPT-2 model months after AID introduced GPT-3 made me realize that GPT-2 was *not* as good as I had once thought. [Here](https://transformer.huggingface.co/doc/gpt2-large) is a GPT-2 web demo in case you want to see for yourself how much worse it is than more modern AI models. Despite not being great in hindsight, I thoroughly enjoyed it at the time. You apparently being satisfied with Griffin also kinda proves my point; it's always been a common sentiment among users that trying the more powerful models ""ruined"" their enjoyment of Griffin. The flaws of weaker AI models become much more apparent once you've experienced more powerful AI models.

On a similar note, here is [Sudowrite](https://www.sudowrite.com/). It has a free trial and uses GPT-3 Davinci; the same model that Dragon once used. If you want an idea of roughly how good Dragon once was, try Sudowrite's free trial. If you want to see how much worse Dragon became after Latitude ditched OpenAI, then try out the AID premium free trial afterwards and test the current Dragon model.

Also, just try some of the alternatives in general. [NovelAI](https://novelai.net/) is often considered to be the best paid option, and it has a free trial. [KoboldAI](https://koboldai.org/) (+[KoboldAI Google Colab link](https://koboldai.org/colab/)) is generally considered to be the best free option, and, at the absolute least, it has AI models available that are basically objectively than AID's Griffin and Wyvern models. Again, it's obviously still possible to get enjoyment out of AID, but a major reason for the complaints about AID is that AID now has competitors that are arguably better. To a lot of users, AID, in its current state, simply isn't worth using over the alternatives.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-10-11-185303","1665507183","None","1665544022.0","0","irwro3g","False","t3_xzt0gb","False","t1_irwro3g","True","t1_irvm154","/r/AIDungeon/comments/xzt0gb/this_sub_has_made_me_question_my_enjoyment_of_ai/irwro3g/","1667961947","2","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None",""

- Use story whenever you can, as it usually provides the best responses. Use say and do if you just want some random adventure kinda experience.

- try to keep info in the memory pin short and concise, as well as update it regularly about state of the story. It helps AI keep to the track. 

- Also, use world info for characters, places, etc. Gives AI a reference, if WI is made well and it helps save energy on needless additional descriptions of stuff (still might want to put in descriptions from time to time though.)

- Don't be afraid to cut out parts of a good response if you don't like them. Stitching many such good bits into inputs is also a good way.
Personally I like to put the fragments of AI responses I enjoy, in a notepad and then putting them together.
Basically don't fear retry and edit, they're useful.

As for buying things... your options are the Steam Version, which gives you ad-free access to the basic AI and a few paid features which can be used to make it a little better, or a subscription, which will give you access to Wyvern and Dragon.  Wyvern is generally better than Griffin, because it's a bigger model, and Dragon is ~~generally the best~~ the largest (not necessarily the best), but Dragon costs credits per use.  So, what you want to do, if you have a subscription, is find a balance where you are using Wyvern most of the time, but having it switch to Dragon when you want a really good response.

(Edit: Or just use Wyvern-Hydra, because that's the one Latitude recommends right now.)

Also, as has been stated, you should feel comfortable using stuff like Story Mode and Edit to improve the AI responses and lead the story where you want it to go: remember, the AI uses whatever is there to generate responses, so if you change it for the better, the AI's responses will change for the better.

Edit: Oh, right, and come say hi on the [Official Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/HB2YBZYjyf).  Lots of people who know what they're doing hang out in the #community\\_help room, along with the devs.

EDIT: someone from Latitude just pointed out to me that Wyvern Hydra is actually the AI they recommend right now, and is both faster than Dragon and generally performs better in their testing.  They would know better than me.

TLDR;

&gt;Essentially, users can do or say what they want in single-player play, but the AI may sometimes decline to generate certain types of content.

&gt;Additionally, those barriers will only target a minimal number of content categories that we are concerned about — the current main one being content that promotes or glorifies the sexual exploitation of children.

Of course, you could also try using GPU or disk cache, but the former requires a supported GPU and the latter will have an infinite generation time.

Plus, I don't remember the exact percentage, but you need to add another 15-25% for more stable performance.

  
Just an example, this is a screen of the 2.7b(5gb model.) running on my HTPC (r5600\\_32gb\\_radeon574\\_980pro ssd). The 2.7b ate 10GB of RAM. [https://imgur.com/a/BN1T2IO](https://imgur.com/a/BN1T2IO)

There are a few things that have been mention, though.   
The first is AI image generation (I recommend NovelAI if you're interested). Personally, I want to buy myself a subscription for the new year and see how much I'll get into it.

The second thing that piqued my curiosity and brought me some new emotions is character.ai. It's basically the AI chats, but you can set them up as text adventures. I haven't fully figured it out yet, but at first glance the AI there is very comprehensible and a little less forgettable. Of course, it may be repeatable or copy-paste chunks of a text, but it's easy to get out of this as it generates 3-4 outputs, and almost all outputs are quite adequate (I just chose which one I like best). Another thing that surprised me is that parts of repeated text actually can play the role of memory (as a status effect, for example). All in all, I recommend giving it a try for a change.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-10-19-000239","1666130559","None","False","0","isuzeb9","False","t3_y7f5zv","False","t1_isuzeb9","False","t3_y7f5zv","/r/AIDungeon/comments/y7f5zv/hello_its_been_awhile/isuzeb9/","1667924948","4","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

The devs have done away with the OpenAI models and have openly said they’re not pleased with the current models they’re using, and they’ll soon be rolling out new versions of their Wyvern/Wyvern-Hydra models; along with rolling out much needed stability updates.

&gt;Out of curiority, OP. How do you think preventing a safe outlet for pedophiles is going to affect those people? 

https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/n0r4r6/who_are_they_hurting_the_ai/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=mweb3x

People were arguing that because the Ai isn't a real person, it didn't matter if Pedo's used it. Hence why the filter should be removed entirely. While the privacy issue is there, it existed because of the pedo/loli stuff.

The false positives were a problem but people always conveniently omit the reason the filtering and monitoring existed in the first place. They also totally leave out OpenAi's involvement as well. They were the ones who made stricter rules and sent out data to 3rd parties.

Latitude is responsible for what happens with sensitive data from their customers.

Latitude could, of course, try to claim damages from OAI if they were in breach of their agreement, but that is Latitude's problem, not the customer's.

Server rentals and so on factored in their pricing could be fair if it wasn't for OAIs predatory bleeding of people's pockets over tech they were supposed to release to the public.

Same thing with Dall-E2. It took a completely different group of like minded people to create and release Stable Diffusion to democratize image generation AI, essentially doing OpenAI's mission for it.

Just like I've seen people from KoboldAI essentially pay out of their own pocket and fundraise when they can to fine-tune custom models. Essentially everyone else in the AI open source community is picking up OpenAI's slack with their mission. Everyone else is driven by passion and interest, retrofitting whatever table scraps OpenAI leaves over to bring open technology to where it should have been. Kudos to OAI engineers and workers, and essentially screw whatever part of their leadership that decided their mission statement baked into their very name is supposed to be a misnomer.

Perhaps characters.ai can give you some new experiences. To me, their AI is much more adequate. But, it's a little hard to run text adventures there, and you can't edit the output at all, but it gives you 4 outputs, so that's not a big problem.

I find myself, even with the memory settings adjusted, (on the worst AI admitably) I find I'm just correcting the AI as it tries to blabber about random shit, or take horrible liberties with my character, (I understand it's predictive, and all that other stuff, but it is tiresome when you have to take so many re-tries, even with functionally unlimited actions due to ads and daily tokens.)   


Understanding that what the Devs have said, since they dropped Open AI (good riddance) they could take the reigns, the magic has faded, and I've probably become jaded, my writing skills aren't even that good and I've feel that I've gotten better than the AI so it's a weird spot for me honestly.  


I've had to get better due to how shit it is, despite the fact that I do enjoy writing sometimes, (IT'S FREE STOP COMPLAINING (response to me by someone else) ), It gets overly fixated if you let it run free, thus the term wrangling is used a lot by me, and has been used in the past, steering, wrangling, you have to be a cowboy and stop it from running through the China shop or shitting everywhere, and it will still try to shag everything, or You'll (I'll) revert to NSFW because it's the only thing it does well (sad I know for more reasons than one, I do enjoy this aspect of it.) .  


I guess it's just normal for people, myself, and others to complain about it at this point, much to the annoyance and tiredness of the subject, nothing new is really being said.  
Another person, 40 minutes later, 1 day, 5 days later (or however long) will say the same thing, or pretty much the same thing, so it makes sense that the residents of this place would be annoyed, even if they fully understand why someone would say it, whatever the small variations of 'it' happen to be.  


The Devs even understand frustrations, and as long as there are no personal attacks, I have not seen, not that I would even be aware of such things, of people being silenced, though the annoyance of the general people/users is well earned.  
Many people do still have fun with whatever projects they have in this game, it's just best used sparingly (nighttime in my opinion) otherwise it begins to get on my nerves again.  


I remember when the AI called me out for ""Arbitrarily winning fights."" and it was both hilarious and a bit stunning, the AI can still have those moments, it's just that they feel somewhat less spectacular now that we've grown (however the hell it is growing) along side this product, for (some of us) months or even years.  
Pardon the rant, I agree with you, it's just getting other feelings, and, mistaken or not, how I am gauging how others might feel about the subject, myself included in this obviously.  


TL&amp;DR The Magic has warn off, if there ever was any, and they're still trying to put the blocks back up, piece by piece, in their usual fashion, if you know you know, if you don't it'll be frustrating either way, indifference would be better than hatred, but if you care about it I could understand being annoyed, a return to form would be nice, without the slandering of your (lol, not me, maybe in the future) customers.

I feel like old latitude is the embodiment of beta males who think they have scores in the double digits. Angry all the time, projecting their insecurities and with chronic paranoia about things they want to believe are right.

And the new Latitude are more honest and not exactly the same douchebag unit, but instead of scoring in the double digits, they behave like virgins who don't perform correctly because they still don't score.

People are stupid, granted, but they're really trying. I want to believe that. When things look up and they understand how to best design their A.I, I'll understand how best to judge their A.I.

Far more features than AID, better image generation (especially if you prefer anime-style images), and fairly powerful AI models that are actually finetuned well. It has a free trial.

[Sudowrite](https://www.sudowrite.com/) is also worth noting. It uses GPT-3 Davinci, but without the heavy censorship of other GPT-3 applications (there *is* censorship, but according to one of the co-founders, they only filter astroturfing; not sexual content, violence, and such, like other GPT-3 applications). It also has more features than most GPT-3 applications. However, it's still lacking some features that are common among other applications like AI Dungeon and NovelAI, and the pricing is pretty ridiculous (Edit: I still think the pricing is a bit on the expensive side, but I've been informed that the subscription tiers were all recently changed to have 2 or 3 times more monthly characters than before, so the pricing isn't *quite* as bad now). It also has a free trial.

Basically any modern AI model could hypothetically do a good job of answering those questions through sheer luck. Although, unfortunately, we can't really test how well old Dragon would do with the same questions since Latitude, y'know, ditched OpenAI months ago. Even using a GPT-3 Davinci application, the outputs wouldn't be *quite* the same as old Dragon since it wouldn't have the AID finetune.

Anyways, Latitude themselves has said that their data shows the new Dragon model to be worse than the old one. That could also be partially due to the different finetuning data (Latitude supposedly changed their finetuning dataset at some point in late 2021 or early 2022 to remove the ""questionable"" content that was originally in the dataset; I don't remember exactly when this was), but for one reason or another, Latitude's data shows that the new Dragon model performs worse than the old one. This is also generally agreed upon by the community (the user you responded to is literally the *only* user who I've ever seen say that the new Dragon model is better).

Unfortunately, I couldn't really find a good in-depth evaluation of Jurassic-1 Jumbo's performance (I *could* find one of [GPT-3's performance](https://blog.eleuther.ai/gpt3-model-sizes/)), nor a good comparison between it and GPT-3 Davinci. The closest things I found were [this](https://freetext.ai/blog/gpt3-ai21-model-comparison/) (which actually supports the idea that GPT-3 Davinci is smarter) and [this](https://medium.com/lokibots/exploring-the-ai21-studio-has-the-jurassic-1-beaten-the-gpt-3-94e69e92e561) (which seemed to suggest that Jurassic-1 Jumbo did better at generating human-like responses to questions, but did worse with storytelling and fake news articles). Also claims from AI21 saying that Jurassic-1 Jumbo is comparable to GPT-3-Davinci. Everything else I found was just comparing the generation time, amount of parameters, the tokenization, and such. And yes, Jurassic-1 Jumbo is better in those aspects, but those, alone, don't necessarily mean that it has better outputs.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-10-23-212212","1666552932","None","1666553192.0","0","itht744","False","t3_yb5v30","False","t1_itht744","True","t1_itgdqg0","/r/AIDungeon/comments/yb5v30/comparison_old_dragon_and_new_dragon_what_i_know/itht744/","1667901137","3","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

AI Dungeon's original training data was pulled mostly from Project Gutenberg, and Infinite Story among other various sources. 

Therefore, you would meet characters like Velzix or Mistress who originated from that website. 

And if you've seen anything to do with 'Eternals', Kelso, and such they also orginate from Infinite Story.

I was playing the generic knight scenario and it stuck me in an infinite loop. It was something like. Walk past the glowing circle of stones into the cave. See a pool of water and a pile of bones in the center of the cave, giant flying skeleton forms from the bones. And no matter what I did it kept having the exact same text. Something like “you hit the skeleton and it rattles”. Then I would escape through the door into the same exact room. Same skeleton same everything. I scrapped that scenario after four or five loops. 

2. Ai breaking the fourth wall and insisting that it was a fan fiction writer in the form of “authors notes” appearing after I died. 

3. Uranus and king tut. This one came out of nowhere. A dragon told me I had to travel to Uranus and kill king tut. Which I then did.

4. Ai forgetting what something is. (I named a wolf companion and a few actions later it described it as unsheathing it’s sword) wolves don’t have hands. And they don’t use swords unless they’re that one dark souls boss.

5. Sometimes I don’t like what the ai gives me. So I repeatedly hit the retry button. One time after doing this about 10 times it had a character tell me to “stop trying to make things better.” That’s probably the strangest thing that’s ever happened to me in ai dungeon so far.

Honorable mention.  In my second game ever about 15 actions in the ai wound up describing me cutting someone’s heart out and slowly eating it. The input I gave prior to the heart eating was “disarm him” I have no idea why it decided that cannibalism was the next logical thing but it did.

Uh, let's see. I had one story where I was a princess in another more medieval world, I got married and ruled a kingdom. One of the characters (I'll call her Eliza) was my best friend and hunting companion. In another of my stories (irl a few months later + on a different, newer account), in a different scenario but still suitably medieval, I had an escort mission and the woman I was taking started to talk about her background. She mentioned Eliza's exact backstory.

I had my character tear up, and we embraced. It was so heartwarming, but also odd that Eliza still like- existed. I didn't know that that could happen.

The 'AI' model is going to run with whatever you say, because it's trained to write text adventures and it'll assume any input you give it is part of a story/text adventure.

The models were also given most of the internet as training data, so it's familiar with tumblr and how it works.
