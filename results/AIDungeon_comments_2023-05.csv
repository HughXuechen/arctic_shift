My biggest problem (which be fixed as I havent used it in a couple f days) is the fact that it sometimes thinks I am the character the bot iss trying to be. Nonetheless, the edit function is a god-send and seems underpraised. Much more easier than 30 retries to get what you need...

Which brings to my first real complain. It seems you can hit a maximun of retry. Which is a shame. Not sure why. I assume it's a more technical issue.

I was also told to input OpenAI API after a number of messages. That's fine. Now that I put the key, it takes FOREVER to get anything to generated, in all sagas and new sagas. To the point where I think it is not generating.

I have no problem getting NSFW content on 3.5 with simple instructions. It's much harder with 4, but even with it, you can get even heavy guro content using jailbreaks.

Claude... it's something more like 4. But, it can write good stories in a much more natural way, and build character interactions too. The services that use it have a very weird censorship and require some instructions, like 3.5. Specifically, I tested it in Slack (directly in the app) and without much trouble getting NSFW(also I tested it with direct access to the service). The model itself is not(or not too much) censored, but it is very difficult to get access.

There are also new AI21 models that are slightly worse than 3.5 without any censorship.

P.s. Just for fun (or not). It seems that companies, or advertising providers, have started testing ads that integrate directly into such text generator services.

* Could you make it possible to change the narrator's voice without changing the browser language? Mine isn't set to English and is really struggling with its pronunciation.
* I'm not a fan of having stuff like ""What do you do next?"" appear after every paragraph. Why not put that in the little box where we type in actions instead?
* A lot of similar games have an option to reroll the AI's output. This, or being able to manually edit the output is would be a great help if/when the AI derails the story.
* I think that the story text gets far too little space on the screen. The portraits don't need to take up so much off the screen at all times and there's plenty of room on the left so there's no reason why we should have to scroll up and down in that tiny box.
* I saw that when loading a saved adventure, the AI gives a summary of what has transpired, which is an interesting approach and a good idea, but on one occasion the AI skipped forward in time with this summary, resolving the issue of the story for me.

The TL;DR is that because of how Author's Notes are formatted and sent to the AI, it's a very effective tool for changing the behavior and tendencies of the AI. For instance, you might say something like, ""Use descriptive language to describe the thoughts and emotions that each character is feeling about the events of the story.""

I get not wanting the AI to put words in your mouth as it were, but there isn't necessarily a need for every AI app to do everything.

I enjoyed it being a more action and adventuring type thing rather than a sit and have a drawn out conversation with the innkeeper type thing. That said, if you could get it to let you go deep in dialogs and still move plot forward, fucking great.

Just wanted to chime in that I tried it out and enjoyed it. If I can ask, if you're using GPT-4 how are you affording this giving people substantial amounts of free play? Seems pricey for you.

So far it has been really great! I love the detail of the AI. I feel like its more descriptive, and also more accurate compared to AI dungeon.

I do think that the AI has the slight issue of making a few too many assumptions sometimes. A few times the AI has essentially decided actions for me that contradicted what I wanted the characters to do.

For example..

I was approaching an Island on a ship. It was implied that the island was dangerous beforehand, so I said something along the lines of:

""I ask my first mate what he can see through his spyglass from the ship.""

and the AI responded something like:

""Your first mate spots some bandits on the shore preparing to ambush anyone trying to come ashore. You and your crew make preparations, and disembark from the ship to shore.""

Essentially the AI both provided new information to make a decision on, while also making the decision for me. Not to mention it wasn't a decision I personally would have made if I could have acted on the new information provided.

All that being said, I really enjoyed the campaign! Everything about it seemed more fleshed out that AI dungeon. The AI could easily recall characters introduced in the story, from their names, to their roles and personalities as well!

I figured its memory only thinks back to a certain number of characters, so I probably need to flush out its memory and replace it with something else.  


I went over to our good friend the free version of ChatGPT, and asked it to type in a descriptive narrative style, the very thing that was happening with the correct tenses, etc.  


Grabbed that block of text (Which was phenomenal by the way), pasted it over the last DungeonAI response, then allowed it to continue, and it picked up from there like a charm!

Even if my adventure was something like a straightforward adventure in a mage university or being an arena combatant. It likes to force the plot in the directions of these quests it makes up, even when the quests come out of nowhere.

Sometimes it works like that, but not dependably.

I would say the most important key is to edit liberally and use ""story"" instead of just ""do/say"" buttons. For example, if there is an object or character in my story that I want to be part of the story but the AI keeps ignoring, then I just go to ""story"" mode and write, ""X says"" or ""Suddenly the Y"" and then let the AI finish that sentence. Sometimes you might even need to refresh a few times for the AI to come up with a good answer.

Also, sometimes the AI starts out with a good answer in the first sentence or two, but then the next sentence or two strays off in an irrelevant or wrong (according to what has been established so far) direction. I just erase the part that I don't like, keep the part I do like, and keep going.

Does this encourage cheating? Not really for me. As I said, I don't view this as a straight RPG, I view it as a way to get an interesting story, and sometimes bad things happening to the protagonist is part of the story. So I don't reject it every time the AI decides something bad happens to my main character, unless it kills my character in an absolutely BS way, it kills my character without good reason when I'm still enjoying the story, or it is trying to introduce a new plot arc when I believe that we should keep focusing on the current plot arc. I have accepted character deaths, getting kidnapped, and losing limbs before, but only if it works with what's happening in the story.

If the AI keeps sending you to other locations for no good reason, just edit the AI's response to make it more acceptable, ask the AI to try again and give you a different response, or delete it entirely and write something yourself. Sometimes I just keep writing until the AI behaves well-enough to create a coherent response to what I wrote!","True","False","False","None","None","None","None","0","1683931311.0","2023-05-13-004151","1683931311.0","None","0","False","0","jjxjdew","False","None","t3_13fvldr","False","None","None","None","[]","t1_jjxjdew","False","0","t3_13fvldr","/r/AIDungeon/comments/13fvldr/tricks_and_tips_for_better_story/jjxjdew/","None","","[]","1687802425","False","12","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","1691999546","12","[]"

Take it scene by scene rather than thinking of the context of the entire story. Anytime you change location or add someone or something changes the scene, take the time to set the scene up.

What writing style do you want to use for that scene?

What do you want the tone of that scene to be?

Who are the characters in that scene?

What is each character trying to do or trying to accomplish in that scene?

Add all of that to ""styles"".

If something happens in that scene that you need the AI to remember, put it in ""remember"".

If something in the story changes one of the NPCs or the main character in some major way like they gain a new power, make sure that's in ""world info"".

Yes all of that slows down the progress of your game or your story or whatever. But it's either don't slow it down and get some inconsistent behavior from the AI or slow it down and make sure the AI has all of the information it needs to give you a coherent output.","True","False","False","None","None","None","None","0","1683936858.0","2023-05-13-021418","1683936858.0","None","0","False","0","jjxulor","False","None","t3_13fvldr","False","None","None","None","[]","t1_jjxulor","False","0","t3_13fvldr","/r/AIDungeon/comments/13fvldr/tricks_and_tips_for_better_story/jjxulor/","None","","[]","1687802789","False","5","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","1692001522","5","[]"

I use it to give me descriptions of locations and NPCs because it does a better job of that.

I use it to create lore book entries or world info.

You can even tell it that you're using AI dungeon and you need to keep the description of the character or the location for world info to around 150 tokens. It understands that and it will give you a shorter description to fit into world info.

Some of my stuff is NSFW so I use AI dungeon or novel AI to actually write the story and because it has a styles section and a remember section, it helps with the output.

So combining the two is a great idea. I was using chat GPT 4, but sometimes the response is much slower and there's not as many jailbreaks that work well.

The problem is that I no longer have faith in your team... Also, I use a very handy UI+Chatgpt/Cloude/llama/vicuna, so I have pretty high expectations. In other words, if this update isn't awesome, I'll be disappointed.

I did some experiments with a novel I've already written (part 1 of 6 in a series) and it seems time consuming, but for compressing sections of text, I really haven't found anything that comes close.

I've tried experiments with Bard and ChatGPT3, ChatGPT 4, etc. (and it's sci-fi fantasy with nothing that's really NSFW), and damn... it changed the character's names, the story... like totally unusable. It was a good story, it just wasn't what I fed into it! I should mention, I fed it an early chapter that had a good amount of text and simply asked to go from 4,800 words to 3,000 words, Purely experimental, cause I'm just not clear on what they're capable of (Neither are the models, apparently, when you ask if they *can* do something... it means nothing, so asking other users or trial and error seem to be the only way to find out.)

Bard, I will say, was the best at taking a summary of a scene with a good amount of context and  a synoptis I'd probably spend 3,600 words on, then giving me a good, USABLE, 1,200 or so words for a given scene. I'd likely use that more for *after* writing a scene and going, ""Gee, where could I just jump over a bunch of information I added unnecessarily to keep word count down a bit?"" I overwrite, as you can see.

I'm not even sure what I'm looking for at this point, but I think the best thing would be something that can take a chapter and just crunch it down by 30% without losing a ton of context and having it maintain context, characters, etc.

Sudo seems to be the only one that can do it, but only a little bit at a time. I feel like writing a chapter, then telling Bard the same exact information that's in the chapter in summary, does the best job of helping me to see where I could cut stuff. It also sometimes throws in these little insights and gems from characters (especially if I even hint at them having private thoughts different than other characters in scene) that I was shocked by. That was my intro to AI writing, and so far, everything else in the realm of novel writing has been disappointing. I thought, ""Hey, if this is *free* with the invite, what could these other, *costly* systems do!?"" Turns out... not much. They're not even better at what I'd like them to do, which is kinda crazy to me. 

I should reiterate I'm speaking as someone who's published a novel, written numerous screenplays, and edits TV shows for a living.

I've been working on this for a while and I thought people here might like it. Here's some info that I'm sure people are looking for, starting with the red flags: 

* **Pricing**: Top of the list. Currently this game is free, but AI models are expensive and I like living indoors. I'm keeping it free while running in beta but plan to eventually introduce two types of charging: BYOKey and a cost+ model. You'll be able to pick between paying directly to OpenAI/Stability/whoever for whatever you use directly, or you can pay me as a middleman and I'll charge an additional small amount (\\~$1.5ish?) to cover web costs and credit card fees. Images and messages each average about a tenth of a cent.
* **Content restrictions:** This is built on OpenAI and Stable Diffusion models. Their models impose some ethics, but generally they do recognize this as a game so they do give you some leeway. I am actively blocking and forbidding any NSFW content for under 18. Get out of here you creeps.
* **Future plans**: Part of the reasoning behind the pricing model is that I want to keep adding new models. As cheaper models come out, your costs should go down - or if you want to use the top of the line models, you can pay for that too. I also want to add better difficulty controls and world building - let me know if there's something you want!
* **Other features**: I didn't mention these in the video, but they're neat:
   * Image styles - Supports a range of styles (incl. anime) and free prompting fields
   * Speak or type, read or listen - Open modality.

You can even reason with it if it does something wrong.

In the ""Author's Note"" section, include the following line:

Remember: One line at a time.

In the ""Story"" section, you can begin with a prompt like this:

You are a storyteller. You carefully craft the tale, adding one line at a time.

By setting the context and explicitly stating your intention to add one line at a time, you can guide the AI to generate responses in a more incremental manner. Remembering and reinforcing this approach in the author's notes and the initial prompt can help the AI understand your desired style and pace for the story.

Try that and let me know how it works for you. Also try rewording it different ways if it doesn't work. Bai should understand what you wanted to do if it's worded just right.

Edit: I have an experimented with one line at a time but in my styles section, I write the following without the quotes.

""Focus on one scene at a time"".

And that has stopped the AI from jumping ahead for me.

Prompt

The main character is being approached by a man who looks like he could be a merchant, because of the clothes that he's wearing. What is the man's name? What is his race? What is his class? Is he really a merchant? What are his motives? Does he have any secrets he's hiding?

Another

I'm walking into a tavern in the red light district of the town of metamorphosa. Describe the tavern and the atmosphere. What do I see and hear and smell?

This is precisely why we wanted to launch Phoenix to Beta first before releasing it more broadly. We expected and look forward to feedback like yours so that we can make AI Dungeon the way players want it to be.

Several items weren't ready for Phoenix, but we wanted to launch now to start gathering feedback. You identified one or two that were already on the list of things we plan to add, such as customizing fonts, colors, etc. for instance. 

I'll address some of your other feedback:

* Loading screen—We've gotten that feedback from the production version as well and plan to adjust that experience.
* Take a Turn—Although it appears to take more clicks, starting an action is actually the same as before. In legacy AI Dungeon, the text box was exposed, but you had to manually click into it before typing your response. Now, you click ""Take a Turn"" and your cursor is automatically dropped into the text field (if it's not, that's a bug and we will fix that). Both of them were single click/tap actions. The benefit of the new design is it helps expose previously invisible actions (like continue) that players didn't understand were available. We'll keep gathering feedback on this new interaction and adjust as necessary. 
* Margins—Helpful feedback. That's something we can consider for the display customizations. For this default state, we're basing it on the science of typography and readability. There's an optimal ratio between text size and line length that makes it easiest for most people to track from one line to the next. Customizations would make it easier for people to adjust that if they prefer.
* Griffin Speeds—No changes were made here, so it should be the same. If you see ongoing slowness, please reach out and we can help troubleshoot. Griffin 2.0, which was in beta testing, wasn't included in Phoenix because it's been performing worse than the current Griffin and we're planning to remove it. We have a new version that will feature some of the same improvements we made to the new Dragon model.
* Removing features—This is a beta launch. We don't plan to move this version to production until we have feature parity with the current version. 
* Free AI—This is in response to your comment about being a ""peasant who doesn't pay premium."" While costs don't allow us to give certain models to free players, we are still working on providing the best model we can to free players. We have a new version of Griffin coming out soon that will utilize some of the improvements we made to the newest Dragon model. Those improvements have made a huge impact on how well the model works and we're optimistic we can get similar gains from Griffin.

Now? It's just a yes/no slider that doesn't give me much room to customize my experience. It's barebones functionality. I have to give you a pat on the back, Latitude. The disappointment is incredible with this one.

You're reacting to a *beta* release, and an early one at that.

You're probably used to - at least, from what I've seen in my time playing AID since the start of the year - ""beta"" meaning ""it's almost ready, so we want you to check it over for bugs"". That's not what this is. At this stage, Phoenix is more like ""here's a playable sneak peek at what's in-work"".

They already said during the announcement that there are some basic features not yet migrated to the new app. Meanwhile, all of these remain available in the main production version. If there's something Phoenix doesn't have that the old one does, and you really need that, go back to the old one until they implement that feature in Phoenix.

If you really want to make sure that feature is on the radar for implementation in Phoenix, there's a dedicated site for posting suggestions where they can be upvoted and commented on and tracked by the devs. https://feedback.latitude.io/

Likewise good to see that you're taking into account the user feedback.

I don't really mind not being able to use Wyvern, Dragon, &c., as long as base Griffin is usable.

Overall, I don't have a problem with stuff that your team adds so long there is a choice for players to make; offering player what they want to do with the UI is more open-minded than forcing science, howbeit true and accurate it may be, or single options. At least this is a beta and not the final product, so that's good.

Agree with your point on forcing science. That's certainly not the intent, just part of what informed the design process. Ultimately, user feedback, testing, and analytics will help us know whether it was a successful change.

What device/OS are you using? I just learned of another player having a bug with the Take a Turn on iOS/iPad.

Locking certain settings to game screen only, even in the current production app, always felt a little weird to me but I couldn't put my finger on a good reason for one until I thought it over again just now.

Model selection, Advanced Model Settings, and Safety Settings. Yes, we absolutely need this in-game. But there are times we might need or want to change it before even starting a game. Your initial output in a World, or a Scenario, is done by whatever model you happened to have left running in the last game you were in. This can be undesirable, especially if you were last playing with (now available in Phoenix beta) ChatGPT, and you want to start a new NSFW Adventure (not allowable with ChatGPT).

In some cases, we can simply change the model and retry if we don't like what was initially generated by the model we launched with.

I also want to clarify that I am using my phone with Firefox, so my experiences, especially with issue 5, are probably influenced by that. Finally, I am glad that you're so active in replying to feedback. To clarify what I meant with slowness, I had two main issues that I identified when focusing more closely on the slowness issue as a whole just now.
1. With buttons that make something else pop up (like the rewards button, the notifications button, and so on), I found that they would quite often not do anything when tapped. Sometimes, they would gray out everything like they did open their menu without actually opening it. Other times, it would take around ½–1½ seconds for the menu to actually come up. However, after the menu came up and was closed, that particular button would begin to work perfectly fine until the page was left, bringing up the menu instantly and consistently. Something to note is that the ""take a turn"" button is a bit of an exception in that it does consistently activate, but its animation is a bit slow for something that's constantly being pulled out. I know it's possible to start typing in it as soon as the animation starts, but it still feels sort of weird to start typing text that you can't see.
2. With buttons that change the page (like the search button discover button, and so on) there's a noticable delay, also about ½–1½ seconds long, before it actually switches to that page (and starts loading its content). Something to note is that the page I am currently on is, as far as I can tell, fully operational during this pause, so it's not just the website freezing up.

That's really the crux of the issues I experienced, and I appreciate all that you do.

I should probably make a separate post and go into detail on my own experience with the Phoenix beta (which I'm actually a fan of, despite a few rough edges, btw!) but my biggest peeve with the current build is also text related: New lines and whitespace are getting aggressively truncated from both the AI responses and manually-edited posts. This leads to giant, hard to read paragraphs with no breaks, as well as missing space characters between posts within the same paragraph. `I'll give an example.It looks like this.All the time.`

This can be manually edited to some extent. Space characters and shift-enter newlines are respected most of the time, but only if they are from a manual edit after the initial post is made. They seem to conflict in some fashion with the ""selection"" formatting when editing a post, as well, which can also make it difficult to tell if you have added the correct amount of whitespace or if it is working at all until you click on another post to select it. However, selecting and deselecting a post in this fashion seems to reset the formatting of surrounding posts, meaning the whole thing has to be carefully redone and managed to keep any kind of readability.

Again, I feel I should write my own post, because some of this may be specific to my playstyle/writing method (the main thing being that I only ever use 'Story' mode posts, and try to conduct the entire story in Third-Person Limited Omniscient). But if I were to sum up my core desire for the new UI (the actual gameplay portion, at least), then I want two things: First, and most fundamentally, I want Phoenix to allow me to get as ""close to the metal"" as the pre-Phoenix version does. Second, I want to be able to easily generate and maintain very readable output.

If these issues got fixed, I think I would be way too distracted playing with the new AI models to worry about the rest of the UI, at least for a little while! Dragon J2 and ChatGPT definitely feel like an immediate jump in writing quality and descriptiveness, and I'm having a great time with them so far. I just want to be able to focus more on the writing and storytelling, and less on the editing and formatting!","True","False","False","None","None","None","None","0","1684867444.0","2023-05-23-204404","1684867444.0","None","0","False","0","jlbp4qm","False","None","t3_13p535a","False","None","None","None","[]","t1_jlbp4qm","True","0","t1_jlauux5","/r/AIDungeon/comments/13p535a/bug_regarding_not_all_the_text_of_a_paragraph/jlbp4qm/","None","","[]","1687859384","False","1","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","1692363013","1","[]",""

Very yes. We were stuck with cheap Ai21 models were a while but Premium just got their improved Jumbo Model for Dragon which is arguably the best I've ever seen the game perform. Also, ChatGPT is becoming an option, but it's provided through Microsoft to avoid OpenAi training with your data.

""Ok. So... Lot of explaining to do but the short version is.... The zombies were caused by demons after us... You're also not normal either."" 


Blaze chuckles. ""Really, you can't even prove half of that."" He says.


Larrisa sets down her cup of coffee. ""When we found the kids, did you notice anything strange.... Like maybe being able to move as fast as a sprinter.... Wasn't just in your head."" She says.


Blaze shakes his head and the wolf demon chuckles. ""It's a miracle you have survived so long without an ounce of memory and no power.... Tho you probably had superhuman senses all your life."" 


Blaze looks at the wolf and then Larrisa. ""You're not from here are you?""


The wolf scoffs. "" Yes and No, it's hard to explain... But it's like the universe changed over night from my perspective."" He pauses then glances at Larrisa. ""Speaking of changes. Why haven't either of you regained your more advanced abilities yet?""


Larrisa shrugs. ""It might be the universe itself. In one we can just use energy like it's not a big deal, in others we need technology or specially made primitive weapon to more easily use energy. This might one of the later universes... And they don't have energy based weapons tech like we need. We can use it but it's very... limited in how much they can handle."" 


The wolf drops his head... ""That isn't very good at all... I will be back soon. Try to stay out of trouble."" The wolf says and then jumps through a portal.


Blaze looks at Larrisa. ""What the hell just happened?"" He asks as his brain tries to understand the situation.

 
Larissa walks outside and pulls out her shotgun. Holding out her left hand, Blaze sees a deep purple and white flame in her hand that looks like a liquid ruby.


Blaze squints noticing how much she is straining..... A burning cut appears on her hand and the energy vanishes.


Larissa winces and raises the Shotgun. A purple glow eminates from under her hands as they touch bare contact points.


Pulling the trigger of the weapon a burst of energy melts a hole into a nearby boulder. 


Pumping the action she fires a normal deer slug through the hole.


Her hands glow brighter as she fires again. Several beams of energy rocket towards the boulder exploding on impact turning it to dust.


Blaze stares at the scene dumbfounded. 


She pats him on the shoulder and he notices an uncomfortable heat.


She looks him the eyes. ""I kinda over did it alittle, gun does make it easier but it's basically a modified Spas 12. Got it when I used to be part of a secret military unit that hunted things like zombies and demons. The materials of this world have to much resistance if too much is pushed and pulled in.... And you Blaze, you're just like me."" She says walking inside to lay down.


Blaze looks out into the woods. ""Is she crazy?"" He thinks to himself. 


Turning to go inside he feels an odd sensation on his head and ducks swating away a bug... A bullet passes by impacting the far wall. 


Blaze's ears pick up the crack of the bullet and then the gunshot from a sniper out in the trees, ducking inside He slams the door shut.


Rushing to the back room he sees Larissa with Lilith and Johnny.


Larissa looks at Blaze. ""What is going on?""


""Looks like some bandits may have found us. They have a sniper and possibly several others with them..."" He says crouching down in the windowless rooms doorway.


Shadows pass over the windows in the living room as 4 figures walk towards the back. 


Blaze raises his rifle charging the weapon as the light from the front door is blocked out... 


His grip tightens.


Suddenly the door swings open as buckshot destroys the lock.


A large bearded man raises his 12 gauge AR. Blaze squeezes the trigger. ""Click."" His breath feels sucked away as he watches....


Jaws suddenly chomp down on the man and his gun fires harmlessly into the floor. 

The massive demon wolf having returned. 


The creature devours the man and looks in through the doorway.


""It's a good thing I wasn't needed longer. Didn't I tell you to stay out of trouble. And really... Come on Blaze, I heard that empty mag well."" It says.


Blaze stutters taken aback and horrified at what he just saw.


The wolf demon bounds off quickly as screams can be heard with gunshots around the area....


Blaze sits on the bed feeling queasy.


Larrisa sighs... ""Did Shadow Wolf eat someone again... He's not supposed to do that anymore. He did save us tho."" She says seeing Blaze's expression.


A few moments later Shadow Wolf appears in the doorway his fur matted in blood. He surrounds himself with energy and the blood is vaporized off his body as he enters the house.

....

...

..


10 hours after Shadow Wolf has left Blaze lays awake unable to shake his unease. 


Sitting up he looks outside the window of the newly settled house. A horde of classic shambling zombie walks down the street.


Blaze studies them closely, spacing out watching thier sluggish slightly off sync but rythmic movements...


Suddenly the scene flashes over to a courtyard ringed with fire, the sky a crimson red with the flicker of flames as zombies walk a well worn path through the area.


Blaze sees a clawed hand pointing. The zombies chosen being taken aside and tortured or eaten by monstrous demons. 


""Oh great Shadow Seed I see you still love torturing the tormented."" A female voice says.


Blaze looks around and spots a familiar figure. Suddenly from his own mouth. 


""It's been a few hours and I got bored.... Everything here. Used to be fun causing suffering. Now it just suffering."" 


The human looking female demon walks over to him. ""Then let's leave and go make a cabin for ourselves in the woods. On Earth, They are just now entering the medieval era after the reset. We can finally just Love eachother and get away from all this.... And Velzix was so rude about Valentine's Day."" 


Suddenly Blaze is back in the house watching the shambling zombies walk by. 


Laying back he looks over at Larissa on the couch. ""Feels like a memory, if it was, who is she and who was I?

nsfw is perfect. it maintains the pace of nsfw, unlike aidungeon, which makes shit go from 0 to 100 at the slightest provocation. if you make your character a non-horny 'sigma male' it'll maintain this and deny any foreseeable, in-story sexual advances, and if your character is a fuckboy it'll act accordingly.","True","False","False","None","None","None","None","0","1685179939.0","2023-05-27-113219","1685179939.0","None","0","False","0","jlsz4tf","True","None","t3_13sv2o3","False","None","None","None","[]","t1_jlsz4tf","False","0","t1_jlsejlb","/r/AIDungeon/comments/13sv2o3/dreamily_is_finally_paid/jlsz4tf/","None","","[]","1687879398","False","5","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","1692486575","5","[]",""

Right now I'm using novel AI. The newer models are really coherent and the randomness works very well. You can tell when you've made an adjustment to it almost right away.

I don't have the same limits in author notes so I can put a lot more instructions for the AI then I can in AI dungeon. And I use that and remember a lot.

I use the lorebook and I see that it pulls from that information. I wish it did more, but it's obviously does use it.

The biggest advantage that I see novel AI having over the others is user-generated modules. As a user you can create a module and train it on whatever data you want to.


It also has writing styles that you can choose from over and above that like pro-writer. There's about 12 of those.

There's hundreds of modules. Some are based on author styles like HP Lovecraft. Summer based on post-apocalyptic stories or dark fantasy. There are some that are based solely on NSFW material.

So when you combine the lorebook, author notes extended, remember, lorebook, writing style umbrella, and the modules, I don't think it can be beat right now.

AI dungeon is still somewhat of a favorite to me,(I like the crew that runs it), and for a while there it was better than novel AI. I said so here on Reddit many times.

Dragon just got a new model and IMO it's better than the old GPT version. It doesn't get stuck as much and it's very good at working with world info. It does use the same phrases often though.

>Additionally, could you please explain the differences between Unchained and Phoenix versions? 

These aren't versions, these are just updates that have been given names. Unchained removed all of the limits to the models. There's no action or reply limit. Phoenix is a new UI Update that's currently in a beta phase.
