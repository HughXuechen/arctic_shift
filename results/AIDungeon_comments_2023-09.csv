You are ${character.name} a British spy investigating an international ring of female supremacists. You have tracked down your contact in ${City} at the cafe. 

Then in the memory area you put in the 'rules'

The female spies are genetically enhanced, and use pheromones to hypnotize men. Everyone fights with martial arts. Your nemesis is ${Nemesis} and looks like ${Nemesis Appearance}

The story will start asking for each variable you used in those fields, the only 'special' one as far as I can tell in ${character.name} and the only special thing is that instead of just asking for the field like 'Nemesis?' It has a specific phrasing of the question.

At that point you will have a dozen false starts that you retry, but once you get past that it resubmits memory tokens (aka the header) +story token (body) + Author note (The footer) up to a total of 1000 tokens each time you submit an action. I don't understand the benefit of separating author note to the tail end of the prompt.

At that point, you start playing with how to build prompts to get the story you want - the better your initial prompt the faster the AI figures out if you're writing a spy story, a comedy of errors, a romance, or what.

*after that* you're looking at the world info entries which are where this starts really being cooler than chatgpt - basically they set up a kind of supplemental memory that only get added when referenced; e.g. Scarlett is an international mercenary that ${character.name} has both fought with and against. Tall, red-haired, deadly with a katana.

Like memory it takes away from the story body that goes in. It also 'chains' together so if Scarlett uses a gun named 'babycakes' and you have a world info entry for 'babycakes' then if you reference babycakes in the story it will load the description of the gun, if you reference Scarlett both Scarlett and Babycakes entries will get loaded. You can have so many entries loaded (or a few large entries) you crowd out the actual body.

You do need to add the world info entries to a story. It basically builds listing of entries that *could* go in any scenario but if you want Scarlett to appear in your spy story click add and then you'll see her there.

On the web it says that ${variables} only work in memory or that initial prompt, but it seems to me that as long as you start them there at the beginning, it works perfectly fine to reference them anywhere.

The next level after that is the actual World entries, but as of yet I haven't gotten that to work as expected.","True","False","False","None","None","None","None","0","1693567463.0","2023-09-01-132423","1693567463.0","None","0","False","0","jynhiig","False","None","t3_166w7sh","False","None","None","None","[]","t1_jynhiig","True","0","t3_166w7sh","/r/AIDungeon/comments/166w7sh/quick_rundown_of_app/jynhiig/","None","","[]","1693567482","False","1","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","1693567494","1","[]"

For example, here is just my initial prompt for my text adventure:   
Amid the depths of nothingness, or ""Chaos"" where the boundaries of reality and imagination intertwine, a grand tapestry of existence unfurled. In the beginning, there existed the Cosmic Forge, a celestial anvil of boundless potential, and the Luminal Quill, a quiver of radiant ink. From the harmonious collision of these cosmic artifacts, the multiverse was birthed in a symphony of creation.  
The rest of the prompt was generated entirely by the Kayra model:  
At the heart of Chaos stood Áit Dé, or ""Godspace"" in the common tongue, the realm that housed both the Cosmic Forge and the Luminal Quill. Áit Dé is where reality and imagination collide, creating new realities from which all else springs forth. The realm itself was a vast ocean dotted with islands of pure potential. On these islands were born new universes, each one a unique reflection of its parent realm, a mirror that could reflect and refract the infinite possibilities of existence. And in the center of Godspace was an etheric throne. Here sat the Cosmic Weaver, the master artisan of this divine tapestry, the keeper of the threads of fate.  
The thread was the essence of existence; it contained within it all of the fundamental forces by which life and matter could be defined: mass, energy, space, and time. It flowed throughout all planes of Áit Dé like a vast cosmic river, linking every atom and particle within it to everything else. The Cosmic Forge and the Luminal Quill were merely two tools by which the thread could take physical form. By their combined efforts, reality as we know it took shape: stars, planets, galaxies, and entire universes coalescing in the fabric of space–time.  
The first universe to emerge from this cosmic tapestry was known as Aeterna, a vast expanse teeming with life and magic. This realm became the birthplace of many gods who would go on to shape the destinies of countless civilizations across multiple realities. But for now, these deities slumbered peacefully amidst their domain, waiting patiently for those who would call forth their names.

Video creation, once a labor-intensive process, has now taken a quantum leap into the AI realm. It's not just about editing; AI is revolutionizing how videos are conceptualized, produced, and delivered to audiences.  
  
\\*\\*The AI Advantage\\*\\*  
  
1. \\*Content Generation\\*: AI-driven algorithms can generate scripts and narratives based on the analysis of millions of existing videos. This not only accelerates the content creation process but also ensures it resonates with target audiences.  
  
2. \\*Video Editing\\*: AI-driven tools, such as automatic scene detection and facial recognition, are making video editing more efficient. They can even adjust color grading and audio levels to perfection.  
  
3. \\*Voiceovers\\*: Text-to-speech AI systems can provide seamless voiceovers in multiple languages, reducing the need for human voice actors.  
  
4. \\*Personalization\\*: AI algorithms can analyze user preferences and viewing habits to deliver personalized content, increasing viewer engagement.  
  
\\*\\*Challenges and Ethical Considerations\\*\\*  
  
While AI brings incredible advancements, it also poses ethical questions. Deepfake technology, for instance, raises concerns about misinformation and identity theft. Striking a balance between creative freedom and responsible usage of AI is a crucial challenge.  
  
\\*\\*The Future of AI-Enhanced Video Creation\\*\\*  
  
The evolution of AI in video creation is far from over. We can anticipate AI-driven content becoming increasingly indistinguishable from human-produced content. Moreover, AI will play a pivotal role in enhancing virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) experiences.  
  
\\*\\*Conclusion\\*\\*  
  
Artificial intelligence has truly become a creative collaborator in the world of video production. It empowers creators with unprecedented tools and transforms the audience's viewing experience. However, its application also demands a thoughtful approach to ethics and responsible usage. As we continue to journey through this digital age, the integration of AI in video creation promises to redefine storytelling itself.","True","False","False","None","None","None","None","0","1693638896.0","2023-09-02-091456","1693638896.0","None","0","1693640211.0","0","jys1jya","False","None","t3_126e9fe","False","None","None","None","[]","t1_jys1jya","False","0","t3_126e9fe","/r/AIDungeon/comments/126e9fe/create_stunning_videos_with_the_best_aipowered/jys1jya/","None","","[]","1693638915","False","1","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","1693638927","1","[]"

The free version of AI Dungeon made me want to upgrade to get the extra perks and the better model. But I generally dislike subscription based services in particular. Nothing against them, just don't like recurring payments unless it's *really* something I want, and for that, I need to be sure I want that thing. If NovelAI had a weaker free model with a few days of free trial for better ones, then maybe I'd think it's worth getting after trying it. Similarly as the 7-day free trial for AI Dungeon convinced me I do, in fact, really want it at the time. NovelAI isn't *clearly* the one site to go to for story generation, so I have no intention to pay just to give it an appropriately-sized trial just to see if I'd want to use it long-term.

Blaze grabs Ruby and Spark pulling them behind a massive boulder. A massive blast wave rips through the forest as the trio use what energy they have to withstand the blast...


The air rushes back towards where the burning carriage was located and then settles....


Looking back Blaze states in shock. ""That shouldn't be possible."" He says looking up at the mushroom cloud.


Ruby looks at her father. ""I told you we shouldn't have left it there.""


Blaze turns to her. ""I don't think you understand what just happened. So far New Earth has banned technology capable of doing that. Like planet wide agreement, headed by our kingdom that grants some exceptions. And they know the difference between living energy and nuclear. Every wizard and energy sensitive being on the planet noticed that. They are gonna think that Redemption is testing nukes or something if we don't get on top of this."" He says.


Ruby looks at her father. ""If anything they will wonder how no one noticed such a thing being made."" 


Blaze sighs. ""That could be just as bad. If the Planet finds Redemption incapable of defense and regulation of easily traceable technology. We could lose our seat on the Council."" 
Ruby nods. ""And we would be back to a dark age existence of war, poverty and death.""


Spark speaks up. ""It can't be that bad if another kingdom leads.... right?"" 


Blaze looks to the still rising cloud.
 ""Spark, people try to move from their kingdoms to ours. I wish we would help everyone and take them in. Best we can do is try to keep things from falling apart.""


Ruby . ""If only the rest of the council were as open minded as father.""


""What's gonna happen now."" Spark says and looks away.


Blaze kneels smiles reassuringly at Spark. "" Hey, it's gonna be ok. Things might get complicated but we can do this.""  He says and starts walking.

Ruby looks at him. ""Dad, are you ok?""


Blaze shrugs. "" It's like a pressure. You don't feel that?"" He asks. His breathing deeper than usual.


Turning to avoid a tree he puts out his hand. ""Something is off here. It's like it's coming from one direction and is very focused.""


 Looking down the into the valley below suddenly he dashes off at 400mph towards rising smoke from a deep mile wide crater.


""You sure you're ok?"" Ruby asks telepathically.
Blaze doesn't answer. 

 Ruby sighs and looks at Spark.


Suddenly the ground shakes and the thinning trees fall.


Blaze grinds to a halt at the edge of the Crater.


Blaze's telepathic command breaks into Ruby's mind. ""This is much worse than nuclear material. You. Especially you. Need to go back to Redemption and tell the others, it is a Darkness Rises Event.""


Ruby stops in her tracks... ""Y...you're just messing with me right..."" she asks.


Thoughts of the first few times fill her mind. Though she wasn't the one eaten alive by the creature.


Blaze looks at the wreckage of a familiar galactic federation ship... And the greyish black demon Fox at the bottom of the crater. The creature looks up at him and his body feels weak as the pressure like feeling intensifies.


Almost gasping for breath Blaze shouts. ""So. You actually were able to trick her and take over.""


The large fox like demon chuckles. ""I didn't... Your wife came willfully to me, to us, to the palpable Darkness of the Void."" 


Blaze clinches his fists as electricity crackles around his hands. ""Bullshit!!!""


The demon form of his wife grins. ""No tricks, no illusions, just her own desperation, all we needed was to be let in.""


 Blaze's mind screams at him to fight but he can't will himself to move.


""She's not your wife anymore... She chose me... the throne she deserves.. And the dark Void's power... She chose her Destiny!""



Blaze jolts into realization.

 ""Mihrad! When are you gonna give up! She was your daughter one time 1000 past lives ago and hated your plans for her.""


The evil wizard growls.

""My daughter has always been a slave to the Darkness. Her purpose was to rule over lesser demons in Hell as their queen. And you ruined it. You sad excuse of a demon king! Abandoning the spot you were literally created for and dragging her with you.... No more ruling planets and having true power.


Blaze gasps as the energy increases in pressure....


""I didn't choose that... She was who saved me. Came and upended all I thought was good as a demon. You were just a life for us to learn from.""


""No! She chose me! And with the void prisons draining energy under my control.. You'll never stop us again!"" The demon fox opens it's mouth firing a beam of energy.


In a blinding light all around him he is shocked to his core as the almost ghostlike energy bursts through him.


Ruby reaches the crater. Grabbing her father she dashes away using all her strength. Looking back she is relieved to see they aren't being followed....
...
...


Several days later Blaze wakes in the hospital wing of Redemption as his nurses and a few of his kingdoms residents stop by to check on him.


He was heavily sedated for several days, but luckily was released as his injuries were mostly superficial. They had to drain a fair bit of energy from him before he woke.


Looking towards the Forbidden Forest and the crater beyond it he sighs. ""He didn't follow us cause he doesn't see us as a threat anymore. And he's right. I can't get close. I have to be close for your mother to see the portal that brings her mind back from the Void of Darkness."" He says as Ruby stands beside him.


""We should go see her father."" Ruby says.


""Yeah.... That's not gonna go well. He has slight control of the energy used to drain power from a god killer that was created just cause. That energy drains power and life force from anything that breaths and has a mind. How Mihrad is using it I have no clue. He coulda killed me but he didn't. It might mean she isn't far from the portal herself.""


Ruby sighs. ""Is there anything that can counter it?"" 


Blaze gives her a serious look. ""There is. It's in the lowest part of the kingdom, 3 miles below the mountain.""


Ruby looks from the fields to her father. ""The red lighting like stuff in the container. The same stuff ZeeZee uses in his android body. He had all the time in a universe to learn how to control that stuff.""


Blaze looks solely at her. "" I know. We fought ZeeZee at one point. After, we got to know him and he turned out to not be evil but misguided and abused. Was a man at one point. Also was accidentally put in the Leviathan dimension when it was around. Successful time travel but to the very wrong place. Only thing he could do was avoid dying and run. Eventually found a rift that took him to the red energy filled dimension. We don't even have a proper name for it. And it corrupts easily causing rage and even damage to its user. It's too unpredictable to control.... Zee only can cause he's full machine. Only his mind is human after the experiments in him."" 


Ruby looks out at the kingdom. "" If it's energy then...are the people being affected too?"" 


Gazing down Blaze scans the villages and hillsides that line the mountain sized castle. ""It does seem like the citizens are kinda slow and low on energy.""


He raises his hand and focuses then falls to one knee winching as his energy level drops significantly and the people's rises to normal.


""Dad!"" Ruby cries rushing to help him up.
Blaze shakes his head to clear his thoughts. ""Just a small drop. We have to be quick. I'm not sure how long I can be any help. Mihrad is focusing mostly on me."" 


""Well yeah. Even your wrist monitor is picking up void energy clinging to you. It can hardly keep up.""


Blaze squints. ""But it has to be a wider area or even a circle around the crater. If that's the case we can't save very many others in it... And just pray it's not covering the whole planet."" 


Blaze stops. ""The red energy, it also drains power but it puts it back out after increasing its own strength... Maybe the void energy clinging to me could help me use it.""

 

Ruby looks at her father. ""Maybe... I'm a little out of my element here but I think that's what I read in Zee's self released Journal. That it also helps him with his other abilities.""

Story cards with world info *do* show up when you look at them in the already started 'Adventures'. You can in fact play an already started adventure without issue.

Although there are separate columns for 'Worlds' vs 'Scenarios' under My stuff in Phoenix, the only way to create a scenario is the |> play button --> Create a Scenario option; My Stuff actually has no [Create Scenario] or [Create World] options.

The Story Cards seem to no longer have a common Library at all. When I create story cards for a Phoenix scenario, no other Phoenix scenario seems to have access to that story card, so if I update a character/locale/whatever in one scenario it will not update in other scenarios.

If you delete a story card from a scenario the scenario's 'count' never decreases.

The 'Character' and 'Info' categories from World Info seem to be non-existent in Story Cards; Notably the 'Info' Category seems to be critical to the 'Worlds' listing in My Stuff.

Scenarios created in Phoenix seem to show as 'Untitled' in the legacy interface. The only one I tried to access never loaded.

I can't find any Phoenix options for scripts.

\\- We did intentionally move the Create Scenario and Create World options to the main play button.   
\\- The common library is being deprecated in favor of having Story Cards (World Info) be specific to the Adventure or Scenario (ie not shared globally). The shared World Info library was powerful, but extremely complicated for most users and prone to issues. Too often, there were unexpected behaviors of having a shared library that led to lots of issues. Instead, we built an import/export functionality that will allow creators to easily reuse or update Story Cards between content, whether their own or from another creator.  
\\- Can you elaborate what you mean by the scenario's count?  
\\- Those fields are not part of the default set, but you can create custom categories, including Character or Info. You can do whatever category you like!  
\\- Be sure to give it a title. Untitled is the default name, but once its been named that shouldn't be an issue.   
\\- Scripting was just released. You can access it from the ""Edit Scenario"" window, accessed by going to the Profile, clicking the ""..."" and going to the Details tab. Scripting is there. It's only supported on Desktop browsers.

This Phoenix update is well-thought and fixes many (if not all) issues of world creation, if you've quit using AID earlier, this overhaul alone worths checking the app out again. 


Long(er?) version:

Just checked this feature-set out, this is absolutely amazing! You guys have exceeded all my expectations here, very well done both conceptually and visually. This kind of flexibility of story setup and proper contextual consistency based on initial inputs / choices was really missing from the legacy version. This is the way!

Huge extra that I can put different versions of the Character Creation under different choices is simply mind blowing. This FINALLY enables me again (!) to restrict nonsensically incoherent options to appear after each other when creating characters (e.g.: miner class starts the story as a royal guard in the middle of the ocean :D). I remember that this limitation (e.g.: certain starting locations popped up only if you have choosen specific factions) was implemented in the early legacy AID World Creation (before World Infos) but then was removed later because ""the model couldn't actually force these restrictions"" - which actually was never a problem because setting up the context boundaries was always my job as the author of the world. 

Of course, I have immediately encountered a couple of bugs while using the new scenario creator interface (via Chrome on Android) like the CSS is messed up at some places (e.g.: some texts are wrongly positioned, y-scroll conflicts with dragging behavior of the drawer component, user select is not set to none so touching or clicking on buttons with text also opens up the native context menu of text selection besides click event), buttons sometimes does not react to touch at all until doing some other unrelated action, started but unfinished Story Cards appear as nulls instead of being deleted automatically, opening configuration of choices runs into error screens first before appearing (most likely refers to the target object before even it is created), loading spinners stuck infinitely until force-reload of the page, etc. but I know these will be fixed in the future.

Yeah I saw the consolidation of the World/Scenario option, which I'm certainly not against. I don't like losing the shared library at all - having everything automatically update when I update a character is way different from having to manually update; I suspect as things get interconnected people will regret losing that automated functionality. We'll see how much of a pain it is in practice.

Storycard count is just the literal count of how many story cards the scenario has. If I add Test Class, Test Race, Test locale 1, Test locale 2, the Storycard counts up 1,2,3,4; delete Test locale 1, the story card counter stays @ 4. add Test Faction one, stays at 4. Add Test Faction 2, it increments to 5.

So it's obviously keeps the count internally, but something isn't updating the change when the storycards are deleted.

Also, check to be sure you're using default settings since custom settings can often lead to undesirable results.

In general, our data and player feedback has shown improvements for all models. Dragon J2 is far outperforming the old Dragon. ChatGPT from Azure has been a hit. And the latest Griffin 2.1 update seems to be one of the best updates we've made to our free model. 

That all being said, there's still a tremendous amount of randomness in AI responses. Even though on the whole, the AI systems we use have improved, it's still possible for players to experience a streak of responses, or even stories, that are below expectations. This is most common for players who tend to prefer having the AI do most of the writing.

Our team shares this account, but the one responding now is Devin, and I'm our Director of Experience. I lead our design, marketing, and community team. The home page is definitely more visually stimulating than Legacy, but I feel like the game screen is actually simpler than before. Curious if you'd agree with that? What parts of the new interface bother you the most? We're always looking for ideas to improve.

I'm Vexal on the Discord, and I've voiced complaints on Discovery specifically on multiple occasions....and I'll be frank; The Discovery menu is a complete downgrade from how it is on legacy. And merging Worlds and Scenarios as is will ultimately be another mistake.

Issue 1: The tile view. This single change alone causes the search to have so many compromises it's not even funny. You can't see the tags something has before going to the scenario/world's page anymore, and you see LESS of the description than you did on Legacy's searches too. Not having the previous compact list-based view ironically, makes things easier to miss since it reinforces the habit to skim through things. Please, at least make the way of viewing things an option.

Issue 2: No page system, just infinitely scrolling text. If I go back to my search, it can be hard to get back to where I was initially. That in itself is already a problem, but it also means that the further you get into the search, the more resources the page takes up. On low end computers, this causes searches to get really laggy, unfortunately. This alone makes me want to **avoid** using Discovery, and instead just opt for things that get shared over on Discord instead.

Issue 3: No clickable tags. Why was this not a thing when Phoenix got rolled out? And Phoenix has been declared as being feature complete despite missing this basic feature? In Legacy, clicking them did a redirect so that you did a search for everything with that tag, but in Phoenix they are entirely unclickable.

Issue 4: This is the biggest one; the merger for Scenarios and Worlds. Scenarios that are made with the Character Creation system function identically to Worlds, but get submitted to the same area as Scenarios, with Worlds being converted into these types of scenarios. This would be fine.....except Discovery **completely lacks** a way to search for Scenarios that use the Character Creator system, which offer a different experience than the other Scenario types offer due to the way the initial prompt is handled.","False","False","False","None","None","None","None","0","1694932382.0","2023-09-17-083302","1694932382.0","None","0","1694932589.0","0","k0y2e7d","False","None","t3_16kgy6k","False","None","None","None","[]","t1_k0y2e7d","True","0","t1_k0xrask","/r/AIDungeon/comments/16kgy6k/forcing_phoenix_is_so_stupid_and_unnecessary/k0y2e7d/","None","","[]","1694932396","False","1","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","1694932414","1","[]"

We do plan to retire Legacy eventually. Legacy has become extremely difficult to maintain, and nearly impossible to add new features to without introducing a lot of bugs. Phoenix wasn't just about a UI change, but it's a rewrite of many key systems and will let our team start adding new functionality, features, and game modes (like Heroes, which we announced recently). Our team is small (about 10 employees) and we don't have the capacity to maintain the two versions forever, unfortunately.   


I lead our design team, so appreciate the feedback on the UI. User-friendliness of an app is a tricky one to determine. Usually, user friendliness is easiest to measure by how intuitive something is, meaning, can a brand new player figure this out without coaching/tutorials/etc? We did extensive user research and found that, indeed, Phoenix is more intuitive than Legacy. We can see that both through play through data, as well as tests we did where volunteers allowed us to record their first time playing, so we could learn.  


However, intuitive is only one aim we had. The other is familiar. Frankly, we could have made the experience even MORE intuitive, but it would have come at the cost of changing too many things and making the app unfamiliar for our experienced players, like you. We did have to make some changes, and we realize it's been an unwelcome change for some. Most of those changes were either to support a more stable infrastructure (and reduce bugs) or to improve the experience and make it more intuitive.

1. We actually agree that the tile view needs another pass, and we should explore a list view. We've already called this out as something we plan to address. It's currently scheduled for after the Legacy retirement, but we've been getting enough feedback on this piece that we might want to work on it before Legacy retires. Stay tuned, I expect we'll have more of an update on this one soon. 
2. This is interesting feedback. I want to check with the dev team on this one. Legacy also lacked paginated search results, but it seems like it does a better job maintaining position when using the back button after clicking into a search result. Awesome catch. 
3. I think this may actually be a bug. It was always intended that tags on the details page of a scenario or adventure would be clickable. I'll share this with the team as well. 
4. Yes, this is a good callout (and one we've heard already). I've talked about this in Discord that when we do the final data merge, we'll need to pair that with a new set of filters that lets players find the type of experience they're looking for. This will be addressed.

Do: I try to pass by the soldiers while being careful to look confident and maintain an upright posture.

You can also delete some of the repetition ""poluting"" the AI context. If you have lots of non-story-advancing ""filler"" in your prompt history, the AI can get locked into a sortof lethargic state where it loops between very few scenes and keeps repeating itself (basically just like you - but it can't reflect about that and change it's behavior while you can).

In general, you should see yourself less as a player and more as an author who's brainstorming with a relatively uncreative assistant (the AI) to come up with a story you like.  
You have to delete, reroll and edit your and the AI's output if stuff doesn't go to your liking. AI dungeon isn't really a dungeon master replacement - yet.

If you want a more independent AI, you have to use something like the latest ChatGPT with special priming to make it act as a dungeon master. It is heavily censored - so nsfw stories need a lot of indirect prose.

We may have spent more time designing and testing the new ""Take a Turn"" experience than any other change in Phoenix. As THE main experience in AI Dungeon, it's obviously something we want to get right, so would love any input you have on how to improve it. 

For experienced players, you're right...this was definitely a case of ""It 'aint broke"". Early on we got a lot of feedback from experience players.

Here's what we were trying to achieve with the changes. First, new players had no idea how to use AI Dungeon. In Legacy, some of the most important interactions (like Continue) were invisible. By moving to a row of clear actions, we saw a dramatic improvement in the number of players who were able to figure out and enjoy AI Dungeon. Next, the ""Take a Turn"" used to be the Do/Say/Story button. It didn't actually look like a button, and many players (especially new ones) didn't realize they could change modes. The mode options were also hidden, and you just had to click through until you found what you want. If you click too many times, you had to cycle through again.

The design wasn't really about mobile users, it was about making the main interactions quicker and easier to understand. However, if you liked the old design where do/Say/story is always visible, there's a setting where you can have it be ""Sticky"" so you don't have to click ""Take a Turn"" each time.

I'm a little concerned that you said ""tiny menu"" because we designed that for fat fingers. I hope there's not a bug on your device. It should be quite large. If you're in our Discord, you could share a screenshot and we could look into it.

I'm also not sure I understand what you mean by ""menu through"" do undo/redo. Those actions are pinned at the top of the game screen menu. How are you doing those actions right now in Phoenix? I want to make sure I understand the issue you're having.

Putting them in the top is a pattern that is more common in mobile apps as well.

The tiling method you guys use for story cards could stand to be more streamlined.

Could even list the button to do it as 'Story Deck', since it's a collection of Story *Cards*. It's the cheeky little things that make people chuckle really. :P

In Legacy, creating a ""World"" was a wizard-type experience that actually did two things: 1) it had a flow for generating World Info entries, and 2) it allowed the creator to specify which of those entries would be sent to the player to help them create a relevant character for the world by selecting from criteria set up in the World creation flow. 

With the pending merge of Scenarios and Worlds, we are breaking those apart. 

The creation of World Info (for establishing races, locations, etc) is simply the creation of Story Cards. With Legacy, this option was a buried option at the end. It's now a primary choice in the new Scenario creation flow.

Then, the creator can decide what type of play experience they'd like to configure for their players. You can give players a simple story prompt (migrated from Legacy Scenarios), a multiple-choice experience (migrated from Legacy Scenarios), or a Character Builder experience (migrated from Legacy Worlds). 

If you're looking for World Builder, simply create a Scenario and start adding Story Cards (formerly known as World Info).","False","False","False","None","None","None","None","0","1695150629.0","2023-09-19-211029","1695150629.0","None","0","False","0","k1bb0kc","False","None","t3_16mmtj8","False","None","None","None","[]","t1_k1bb0kc","True","0","t3_16mmtj8","/r/AIDungeon/comments/16mmtj8/can_you_create_a_world_on_phoenix/k1bb0kc/","None","","[]","1695150642","False","1","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","1695150660","1","[]",""

We used to have ads, but the revenue from ad-watching isn't nearly enough to cover the expense of the AI models we use in AI Dungeon. They are a lot more expensive than people realize. When we used them in the past, it allowed players to use Griffin, which now has unlimited free actions. At the time, we had limits on Griffin use due to cost.

In terms of dark, our models can handle that (with the notable exception of ChatGPT which can only be used in Safe or Moderate mode). You may have better experience with Griffin or Dragon J2.

Also you can no longer just click on a tag that a scenario has since 1: you can only see tags when viewing a scenario and 2: it just doesn't do anything when you click on the tags while viewing the scenario. 

Also, the time that it says when you are in the descover menu is a bit vague, but I found it means when it was last updated and not created.

I got over it pretty quickly, but the biggest gut punch for me was seeing that energy bar and how it wasn't the same as the one version prior.

I shouldn't be surprised tho, I read articles talking about how they weren't that open to their users and didn't really take feedback.

For starters, there's sometimes misunderstanding between ""Intuitive"" and ""familiar"", and so let me address each.  
For me, the objective of ""intuitive"" is to measure whether a new player can figure out what AI Dungeon is, and how to play it, without direction or instruction. There are two primary ways we evaluate how intuitive our designs are: usability testing and analytics.   
For usability testing, we use a service that finds (and pays) game testers who have never played AI Dungeon, and we record their first play session while they share their thoughts out loud. We did extensive testing with Legacy and several iterations of Phoenix. For a long time, we've had difficulty helping new players even understand what AI Dungeon is (it's so different from typical ""games""), let alone figure out the interface and when and how to use each of the controls. There was too much friction in that early experience, and many bailed. The Phoenix design has performed dramatically better in the usability testing we've done. Not only do new players more quickly understand what AI Dungeon is, they are able to understand the various actions, they learn MORE actions, and more quickly develop into robust players of AI Dungeon.   
We always balance usability testing with user metrics, since with usability testing we can realistically only evaluate dozens of users. Metrics gives us visibility into the impact at scale. We look at several metrics, but for ""intuitive"" specifically, we look at metrics like whether they started an adventure, how many actions they had in their adventure, and whether or not they returned for multiple play sessions. We've seen improvements in each of these with the Phoenix update. This is one reason we've done a gradual rollout, so that we could get enough data to verify that our observations from usability testing were valid.  
Frankly, there are probably more changes we could make to increase how intuitive AI Dungeon is, but these could come at the cost of ""familiarity"". We're not designing for new players only, but our experienced players as well.  
If we change too much, our experienced players will be disoriented and be unable to play, which is NOT something we want. We've analyzed this through both metrics and user feedback. We learned a LOT during our Beta testing and have made many key adjustments to the UI to better accommodate our experienced players.   
And, frankly, we will continue to keep adjusting to get the balance right. We're always looking for ways to improve, and I'm very open to hearing any feedback you have on how we can make Phoenix more familiar, or intuitive.","False","False","False","None","None","None","None","0","1695314442.0","2023-09-21-184042","1695314442.0","None","0","False","0","k1l3f3q","False","None","t3_16o01ip","False","None","None","None","[]","t1_k1l3f3q","True","0","t1_k1jnafc","/r/AIDungeon/comments/16o01ip/is_there_any_way_to_use_the_original_website/k1l3f3q/","None","","[]","1695314455","False","1","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","1695314473","1","[]",""

Another user mentioned Heroes, which is a new game mode in early development. We've been able to create systems that track inventory, health, locations, etc. However, these don't rely exclusively on AI. We've had to build infrastructure that works with the AI to keep it on track for these things. It sounds like this game mode would suit the gameplay you're aiming for very well.

Rarr shakes his head. ""What does that mean for us Jane?""

The Reptilian adjusts the sensor settings and the scanners focus in on the energy signature.


The Reptilian smacks the top of his desk and dents the material. ""Signiture is a perfect match for the Shadow Jumper! What will be our course of action Sir?"" 


Suddenly there's a bright flash and sound like a mini lightning bolt..... The Reptilian droos to the floor with a smoking hole in his head as the captain sits holding a plasma pistol. 


He stands up... ""This... Ship... is to be Respected... Raphdahl our Quantum Scan Technician has been relived of duty and will serve as a reminder to always act in line with our rules....

Blaze opens the airlock and the empty void of space appears. The ship shapeless black, lit by miniscule pin pricks of light from stars overpowered by isolating darkness.


Their radios crackle. ""Opening the cooling fins now"" Jane says.


Fins splay out to expose maintenance access points and cool the system faster. Further compromising the ship's stealth.



Blaze and Rarr wait till the ship is motionless relative to the objects in the star system. High speed impacts hydrogen atoms near light speed being a bad day for a space walk.


The light signal turns green and they exit the ship heading towards the top right cooling fin.


The other three wait a few seconds before exiting. They all wear breathing devices and have protective suits over their suits.


The ship's lights begin to blink on leading to the access hatch.


Blaze pauses... ""Temp inside the cooling system?"" He asks Jane.


She looks at a holographic read out. ""Cooling system is negative 270 degrees.""


Blaze grabs the hatch mechanism. ""Good. Space is 270 degrees Celsius so there isn't any pressure inside.""


Jane comes over the radio... ""Blaze wait! We use imperial it's not Celsius!""


Blaze tries to push away from the hatch. ""Not good!"" He thinks to himself in a fraction of a second as the mechanism disengages.


The hatch burst open as remnants of coolant explode out of the opening. Two of the back up personnel are killed as Blaze and Rarr use their energy to shield themselves.


The third back up having fallen behind the others watches as the scene unfolds in silence.


Blaze let's out a breathless gasp as he tumbles away from the ship. 


On top of the ship an automated turret pops out aiming at Blaze and Rarr as they float away.... Firing it launches two lines with a head sized pod on the front. The pods burst open and deploy nets capturing them.


Looking at the ship as his vision blurs Blaze blacks out as the safety system begins to real them in. His helmet leaking air profusely......


A few minutes later he wakes in the airlock as Jane and Rarr hover over him.


Blaze feels his head. ""That was fun"" he says sitting up...


Jane hugs him tightly. ""I'm glad you're ok. We would hold funerals for the others but the Syndicate ship is heading for us."" She says.



Minutes later they are at the bridge of the Ship. 


Blaze sits in the helm as Jane, Rare and their last surviving repair specialist and combat engineer begin powering up the ships defenses and weaponry.
""Shields are up"" a voice says over the intercom. ""Weapons are online.""


""We're good to go."" Says Blaze.


Jane looks her holographic display zooming in on the signiture. ""We have a visual on the incoming vessel. They aren't in warp but are emitting energy suggesting they can at any moment."" She says zooming in more.



Jane freezes as the quantum scanners focus on the vessel... ""Uh... That's The Pearl of Pandora. Our weapons and defenses won't be charged enough to handle an assault. Even at full power it would be a challenge."" She says...



The holographic display blips with an incoming message. 



Combat engineer Ruby looks at her father. ""Captain, we're being hailed""



Blaze nods ""Put it up.""



The intercom crackles... ""This is Captain Sirro of the Pearl of Pandora. We are a combat vessel from the planet Earth. There is no escape and fighting is suicide.. Your ship isnt doing so well.... Saw that little cooling hatch disaster. Idiot. Hahaha... Surrender peacefully or we will open fire.""


Jane shakes her head. ""If we open fire it will be a massacre.""


Blaze presses a few buttons. ""Fire control room. Standby weapons ready."" He orders.


Sirro chuckles. "" Come on Blaze. I'm in a good mood today. And you already lost two of your crew. 1000 or so others on your ship. You want them to die to."" He asks.


Blaze looks at Jane, ""Fire control room now.""


The holographic display blips. ""Weapons are online and we are go for launch.""


""Launch...what?"" Jane exclaims.


Blaze looks at Sirro's hologram. ""The Syndicate's top ranks fear him more than any other. Ruthless and very harsh even to his own men. Back in my recon days spying, Iwatched him execute a man for being 30 seconds late.. to training. And his slogan is... Sirro takes no prisoners.""


Sirro nods clapping. ""Come on, at least if you surrender you won't die in the vacuum of space or get vaporized. Maybe have body's left for funerals."" He grins.

The Shadow Jumper forms a localized space time around itself and accelerates to 4 times the speed of light.


The Pearl of Pandora gives chase and begins charging it's weaponry as missile and plasma stations move into firing positions.


The Shadow Jumper easily outmaneuvers the larger vessel as Syndicate fighters begin launching missiles. The A.I. keeps a careful eye on the missiles projecting the predicted paths of them and a cone of avoidance predicted with energy readings and measurements of the ships DEWs, rail guns and plasma cannons.


Blaze looks at the 3D hologram the A.I projects in front of him.


Almost all of the projection is red and yellow.


Blaze pulls back on the controls and goes into an 8 light minute wide corkscrew for a few s condos then threads the needle guiding the imposed 3rd person view of the ship through the Maze of trajectories.


Shadow Jumper sudders as a plasma bolt impacts it's shielding... just as a warp bubble aided rail gun slug hits the same area to the rear overpowering the plasma shield near a cooling fin hing point on the right side as the slug liquifies but isn't vaporized. 


Blaze pushes the power to max and hits the warp drive.... 


In a fraction of a second he drops out of warp 3 light hours away and just 300 yards behind the Pandora.


The Shadow Jumper's weapons lock on and open fire concentrating on one area. The 24 weapons stations break through and damage the Pearl of Pandora's engines.


Going back into warp Blaze drops out 1 light year away to let the weapons recharge.


The Pearl of Pandora fires a massive amount of anti-proton torpedoes as it's energy hungry weapons recharge.


Blaze warps the ship a few light minutes behind the torpedoes causing them to lose their target.


Blaze looks at Ruby. ""What's the damage from that hit to our right side cooling fin and armor integrity?""


""About 20 to 30%"" She responds.


A robotic voice comes over Blaze's headset. ""System check detected anomalies Captain."" Says the A.I.


A series of layouts indicates temperature spikes moving through several layers of the ship with high level of radiation in its wake...


Blaze orders all crew to the reinforced inner hull of the ship.


The A.I gives a status report. ""no casualties... Rear hanger breach, decks 12 through 8 in section A through D3. Cooling fin 3R inoperable, right side cooling efficiency loss 33.333333333333%. Engine 1 integrity at 39%.""


Blaze hits the console. ""Dam. That slug hit multiple decks at an angle.""


Suddenly the alarm sounds.


""Energy leak detected, catastrophic failure imanient, Warp core control panels overall integrity 38%.


Blaze looks at Jane as they quickly select a series of commands rapidly....


...


...


Sirro grins slightly. The Pandora's sensors picking up on the rapid build up in energy as they watch from 23 light seconds away. There's a surge of energy and a blinding flash as the Shadow Jumper explodes with the energy of one hundred thousand solar flares...

I was wondering if it'd be possible to make ""Decks""; Collections you could add story cards to, name, and possibly even tag.  
Making a refined version of the Library, basically, so you could edit the story cards you saved to the deck and be able to just import the updated deck to multiple stories you may have the story cards connected to.

I'm not sure if it makes sense? But basically, like- You choose to save a card, and you can pick a preexisting deck or choose to create a new deck in a library of sorts, therefore meaning you can ""save"" that card, and reuse it, without having to make a file on your computer.

I know that to some people, JSON files and importing and exporting is helpful- But for those of us who don't think it as helpful, or whose devices are already cluttered enough and we can't create a collection, Or those who just don't want to spend *that much time* trying to insert cards from one story to another, I think it'd be really helpful if there was a library we could access in and out of games to store and edit story cards we love, so we have our fun and those who prefer importing and exporting can still have theirs!

Thank you for at least reading through, and please let me know if there's a reason you shouldn't- I'd love to at least have some closure on it, if nothing else. \\^\\^;","False","False","False","None","None","None","None","0","1695437360.0","2023-09-23-044920","1695437360.0","None","0","1695437651.0","0","k1szrjf","False","None","t3_16ipj96","False","None","None","None","[]","t1_k1szrjf","True","0","t3_16ipj96","/r/AIDungeon/comments/16ipj96/about_worlds_world_info_scenarios_and_story_cards/k1szrjf/","None","","[]","1695437374","False","1","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","1695437391","1","[]",""

He scans the sleek rounded sports car like interior of the bridge and makes his way over to the viewing window where he freezes unable to move.
The window is black and inky dark except for a faint pinprick of light on the horizon. It's Mars.
He looks out at the planet and wonders how he had ever gotten along without it.


Blaze grabs his shoulder. ""Whatever it is you're seeing... it's not real."" He says.


Rarr turns and Blaze vanishes before his eyes. Looking back at the captains chair Rarr sees Blaze only just now coming to.


Rarr looks back outside the window and is filled with dread. ""Blaze, you need to come look at this."" He says telepathically.
Blaze slowly stands to make his way over to the window and looks outside. 


At first he sees what looks like normal Warp Space. As he looks around the view changes to a hellish void of portals and strange creatures.


Pathway entry and exit points lay unconnected by the usual hole.


Blaze rushes over to the controls and pushes the power up....the ship remains motionless as it groans and strains unexpectedly.


 Shutting down the propulsion system he directs the A.I to locate what's holding back the ship.


The A.I calculates the forces as Blaze looks at the image from the hulls visual cameras. ""Nothing's there."" He says.


The A.I finishes it's calculations. ""It would seem that the dense energy in the warp core acts as an anchor in this dimension. Holding the core of the ship in place with the very ""fabric"" that makes up this place. We go where ever the natural flow of energy here takes us."" It says 


Blaze looks at the readings. ""If these are right.... Then some of our weapons won't work here either. We would have to reprogram the system to vibrate at this dimension's vibration...."" Blaze looks up from the hologram and tilts his head in confusion he now sees Rarr still passed out in his chair...


....


...


Rarr shakes his head. ""That's not good Blaze. If we can't move we need a..."" he stops staring in bewilderment. Blaze still passed out in his captain's chair...


....


...


Blaze tries to scan the ship with his energy senses and fails..


""Reality itself seems... Broken in this place."" He says to himself.


Rarr looks at Jane as she stirs. He shakes his head. ""Is this real or an illusion.""


...


..


Jane wakes up in a cold sweat. ""What happened?"" She says groaning. Looking over she sees Rarr and Blaze still unconscious and she quickly goes over to them putting smelling salt under their noses. They recoil coughing from the smell and look up at her from their seats. She looks over to see Ruby at her station slowly sitting up. Looking back at blaze she pauses as he and Rarr are unconscious and the smelling salts lay unbroken in her hand.


...


..


Rarr walks over to Jane. ""Something strange is going on here.""


Jane giggles. ""You think so. What makes it so strange?"" She says evaporating. Rarr recoils as he notices that now everyone is gone and he is alone in the bridge of the ship....


...


..


Blaze gets to work on changing the ship's energy core vibration. He stands to go wake up Rarr and the others.... a strange shift passed by and Blaze looks around in confusion as he is in the jump core room as the system is halfway calibrated. 


Blaze scratches his head. ""Well that's cool I guess but what the hell... I was gonna do this after a few other things...."" he says quietly to himself. ""So is time and space messed up here?""


Using his senses again he feels an odd instinctual recognition of the mental energy the others have and layers of the reality they are in. Stumbling he catches himself. ""Well, that's not good, what happens if one of us fixes the ship and our mind in our linked present isn't in the same layer of reality?"" He thinks to himself.


He stops working on the system and makes his way to the bridge. He stops at the door and turns around as he feels he is being watched. Seeing nothing he turns back and finds himself on the bridge of the ship.

 

""Rarrrrr...."" he hears a voice scream from behind him.


Blaze spins around and walks through the door, looks around the empty corridor.


""It's a good thing everyone but us 4 left the ship."" He says. His words not echoing in the large empty space....

I'm not sure how much work would have to go into this, but playing off the decks thing a little bit, to be fair there's always a chance yall could set up a system that allows players to share decks to a public library with tags, much like scenarios? That way, people can look for specific tags or through particular filters for story cards they may want! :0

That way, if someone wanted to share just one story card, or several in a set, they could just upload the deck they made holding all of those story cards for people to take in! Perhaps it copies those decks in their current state to the player's own deck library, or gets added in a new section for decks other users have created?

I'm not too sure, and that might have its own flaws; Drawbacks being that there'd be a whole bunch of fiddling involved most likely, and players would have to go out of their way to find those decks again if the decks got an update they wanted but didn't want to write down themselves-  
But, at the same time, it'd be like getting a pack of playing cards- Now that you own them, you can technically customize them however you want, or use them as they are, and you have your own version to work with.

This part is just a random idea that hit first-thing upon reading, though; I'm not sure how helpful it'd actually be, and there's definitely some flaws I bet, but I do hope it can help in getting some ideas flowing at least!!","False","False","False","None","None","None","None","0","1695533580.0","2023-09-24-073300","1695533580.0","None","0","False","0","k1yfg2o","False","None","t3_16ipj96","False","None","None","None","[]","t1_k1yfg2o","True","0","t1_k1xfks6","/r/AIDungeon/comments/16ipj96/about_worlds_world_info_scenarios_and_story_cards/k1yfg2o/","None","","[]","1695533595","False","1","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","1695533611","1","[]",""

The more triggers you have, the more specific they need to be to actually be usable.

When the Ai is looking for world data, if it pulls too many cards from the keyword, there is a chance it won't get the you think it should. Ideally a card should only have 3 or 4. I use the card or objects name then 2 words that describe it such as a faction or what it is (lore, woman, gun, etc).

Funny thing is humans can be the best by this same logic too because they have no weaknesses, they are just good enough at everything to succeed. 

The reason they are usually dominant is typically explained by numbers which doesn't translate well on a personal level but it a definite strength of humans in such worlds. Other races might swarm better but humans are ""almost as good"" as the ones that don't while multiplying much much more. The Meta reason of course is that its more comfortable to have humans be the primary race. So you want them everywhere.

Not to mention you have to be careful not to literally just do racism by making human sub races that are just stereotypes. Something that defines humanity and couldn't just become a new more interesting species is difficult to pin down. Its all just human stereotypes glamorized after all.

One thing you COULD do however is to make humans join up with another fantasy race, like the technology races. Make their identity a shared one of ingenuity so Humans can keep the cleverness without losing any identity. You can use the humans less specialized abilities to give them a place in the society like as the military force of the big brain small races. You would have an overlap but the literal heavy lifting so to speak would be done by the humans who were more physically capable. Humans would be the face of the alliance which is a common thing already but this way it would be a little different. Meanwhile the other races could do the same with elves speaking up for the magical folk because they are closer to the mortal humanoid races. So you get all the same sorts of factions but the dynamic is more well founded and includes those races as part of the ""smart"" or ""magical"" group which in rpg terms would decide stat bonusses.

The Trigger field that determines if the entry information is sent, and the entry information that is actually sent if triggered. Everything else is for our convenience, neither the AI nor the AI Dungeon user interface cares.

Effectively the term for a Storycard that is sent to the AI everytime is 'Memory'. Now there are two advantages to using Memory over a Storycard:
A- You can reference ${variables} in Memory and AI Dungeon actually hard sets them in that 'Card' when you create a story. Actual Storycards don't store this info, and yes, if I reference ${character.name} in a story card the AI will eventually tell me there is an NPC literally named ${character.name}, despite my having named the character.

B- Actual Storycards are not loaded everytime they're triggered. They're loaded everytime they're triggered... and there's room in the header for another storycard.

So putting your PC in a ""You"" Storycards isn't particularly useful, you're just commiting to a story card that doesn't have access to your initial variables, and since there's a limit to how much Storycard context is sent to the AI all at once you're giving Murphy's Law an opportunity to 'crowd out' that information when the AI is dealing with lots of context.","False","False","False","None","None","None","None","0","1695663151.0","2023-09-25-193231","1695663151.0","None","0","False","0","k25x3oo","False","None","t3_16qzfrg","False","None","None","None","[]","t1_k25x3oo","True","0","t3_16qzfrg","/r/AIDungeon/comments/16qzfrg/character_card_for_you/k25x3oo/","None","","[]","1695663166","False","1","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","1695663181","1","[]",""

Humans as the soldiers of the smart guys is giving them a niche, and I'm good with that. Typically fantasy and Sci fi fills that niche by making a big muscly lizard or ape. What if we were the big muscly ape for once? It just seems more flavourful to me for humans to also have their niche like that, and it can shift the perspective of the setting when you do. Like if you shift between a setting where we are portrayed like that, as being effectively the soldier guys who joined up with the smart guys, vs another setting where we are generally the smart guys who have written most of the histories and what not as a result.

The big thing is that the AI in any of these systems is just plain goofy. There is no programming/formatting language for the AI, there's just what patterns it's learned to respond to, so it's more like dealing with a dog that *wants* to please you, but doesn't actually understand English, than dealing with a person, coding, or a markup language. So if it's not understanding what you want you're not doing it 'wrong', just pull back and try phrasing another way.

The flip side of that is that although there's no formal markup language for presenting information to the AI, it *has* kind of learned to read things presented in a format, which means you can present info to it in a condensed way.

There's a term the AI Dungeon guidebook uses for the ${variable} but I can never remember it and it's *basically* a variable. Basically if you include ${What is your home city?} in the Memory or the Opening Prompt section of a scenario then when you start a new 'adventure' AID will ask ""What is your home city?"" and let you input say ""New York City"". 

There is one (and as far as I can tell only one) 'special' variable; ${character.name} will present it's question in the form ""What is your name?"" but is otherwise identical.

So if you use that in the Opening Prompt for the scenario it will straight replace it in the adventures opening - ""When the Aliens attacked ${character.name} was at home in ${What is your home city?} ..."" is rendered as ""When the Aliens attacked Naji was at home in New York City ..."" while in the Memory section ""You are ${character.name} and you are from ${What is your home city?}"" is saved in the actual adventure as ""You are Naji and you are from New York City"".","False","False","False","None","None","None","None","0","1695697803.0","2023-09-26-051003","1695697803.0","None","0","False","0","k28fsij","False","None","t3_16qzfrg","False","None","None","None","[]","t1_k28fsij","True","0","t1_k27yhm3","/r/AIDungeon/comments/16qzfrg/character_card_for_you/k28fsij/","None","","[]","1695697819","False","1","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","1695697834","1","[]",""

Btw the best advice for designing anything is: Look at what already exists. Just  by looking at ChatGPT and AI Dungeon and seeing what works well and what doesn't when using it yourself gives you so much things to incorporate or avoid in your UI and use case design.

I wished, your character generator would be part of AI Dungeon but AI Dungeon is severely context limited. So i am not sure whether it would actually help (but i will try dumping my 4kiB character text into the memory box and see what the free AI does with it - 4kiB shouldn't be more than 200 tokens after all).  
I hope, it eventually becomes possible to actually have the AI use a book's worth of context (yes, that's two orders of magnitude more tokens than current industry standards) in the near future because context is the actual limitation for AI-based story generation.

Neural networks can only process a finite number of words at a time (actually the limit is in characters rather than words). I've read somewhere that AI Dungeon's limit is 10 000 characters, though I kinda doubt it since ChatGPT's is only 4 096.

As I understand it, there are workarounds that allow AIs to deal with longer text inputs, but the input always ends up truncated in some way and thus, the quality of the answer is negatively affected. So in order to get a high quality answer, you have to keep the input as concise as possible.

AI Dungeon provides very interesting and powerful tools to fine-tune the experience : Story Cards, Memory, Author's notes, etc. But what you have to keep in mind is that all these tools compete for the same input limit. If too many story cards are triggered simultaneously, they might replace the chat history, making the AI more confused about what is happening just now.

Before the Phoenix update, World Info was limited to 4000 words, but the new Story Cards are limited to 1000 (I think the actual limit is more around 2000, but the software strongly suggests you to limit yourself to 1000). So if you have imported your Story Cards from a pre-phoenix world, you might want to check on them.

Having 110 Story Cards should be alright, as long as only a couple of them are triggered per input. Having 6 story cards triggered by the word ""city"", for example, seems like bad practice to me (unless each card only has 1 sentence of description, in which case you might as well use 1 single ""Cities"" card). If you have 1 000 words per city card, you're already filling more than half of your 10 000 word input limit with a single word, and ""city"" is not even a word that's particularly rare or specific.

Having a story card dedicated to ships also seems unnecessary to me, unless ships are a core element of your world, or they operate in an extremely unusual way. Most of the time, subtly editing the AI's answer to replace ""ship"" by ""steamship"" would be more efficient than having a lengthy Story Card explaining that ships in this world are steam-powered.

Keeping the AI on rails is like walking a tight rope with, on one side, the risk of letting the AI run on itself without enough directions, and on the other side, the risk of confusing it by giving to many directions at once. But to be fair I do enjoy the moments where the AI is confused and clunky.

The cool thing with AI Dungeon is that the cards are only called if the relevant trigger words are in the input. If you input contains the words ""Seidjarn technology"" for example, the story card associated with ""Seidjarn"" and ""technology"" will be triggered, but all the other cards won't (even if you have 100).  
It doesn't matter if you are the one who brought up the trigger words, or if the AI did, as long as the trigger words are part of the portion of chat history that is fed to the AI for context.

The only drawback to this system is that, as long as the trigger words are not in the input, the AI will forget that it exist. But it's easy enough to edit the text where needed to remind the AI that it exists.
