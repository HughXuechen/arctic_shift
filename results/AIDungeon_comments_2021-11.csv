AI Dungeon is more like a tabletop RPG with an AI acting as the Game Master. This is a CYOA with an AI acting as the author. AI Dungeon is personalized and unique to yourself. This is curated and driven by the community as a whole. The main similarity between the two is only that they both use AI-generated text.

Also, I feel like looking at it as “re-reading others’ experience” is the wrong way to look at it. It’s a shared experience. When a person reads a book or watches a show or listens to music, they’re experiencing the same thing as everyone else. Even though everyone will experience the same thing, that doesn’t take away from the experience. If someone reads a book first, that doesn’t mean that everyone after them is just “re-reading that person’s experience”, for example. The first person to read and the millionth person to read may enjoy the book the same amount.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-11-01-222523","1635801923","None","False","0","hixlwfn","False","t3_qjcmym","False","t1_hixlwfn","True","t1_hivwnce","/r/AIDungeon/comments/qjcmym/im_making_an_aigenerated_chooseyourownadventure/hixlwfn/","1646153689","2","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None"

*to stay within OpenAI's TOS, which requires companies to ban CP &amp; Pedo content. Almost all online games and services will ban you for that stuff. Mind you, they already annou ced a better filtering solution that primarily targets published content. 

Nonsense aside, in recent months they've added world creation for free, brought back the explore tab and the ability to share stuff, a host of UI improvements, and image generation.

Then for each entry that you created before, in each category, on each item click add.

Then you can go ahead and create more stuff under races and classes and factions and characters and all that.

Each time that you create one you have to click the little globe that says add to make it active.

Keep it simple. I tend to have the best time with Dragon with capsule scenarios with just the player character and one NPC, where that NPC has clear motivations and a strong personality. Yes, uh, this does often mean porn, but not necessarily. The AI can sort of keep track of more stuff, but I've never been able to get it to play characters well with any consistency in any sort of more complex situation. We'll have the technology to do more ambitious stuff in the future.

WI should be considered a specialty tool IMO. It's for those few situations when you know that a fact is relevant exactly when you bring up a keyword, and never otherwise. Otherwise, I prefer to cue the AI and write summarized references to past events on the spot myself. I think WI is overrated and a lot of people just don't properly appreciate the fact that if a WI entry isn't triggered, the AI simply does not know about its existence at all, and even when it is, it's hard for the AI to actually make use of it.

Test a lot, but don't take your test results *too* seriously. You can retry dozens of times and keep getting results with misleading patterns or no clear pattern at all. But if a bunch of retries keep taking the story in a direction that you feel is wrong, it's a good enough signal that it's probably worth trying to adjust your wording.

If you haven't done it yet, do this at least once: Create a scenario and start an adventure from it. Play the adventure in one tab, while in another, you go to edit the scenario, go to the Scripts view, and press the brain icon in the top right corner. That's the Last Model Input, which shows what the AI actually sees of your story. You don't need to use it for normal writing at all once you've seen what it does, but using it at least once, and seeing what WI, memory, and AN actually do and how simple it really is, is really important to knowing how to use AID properly.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-11-05-061317","1636089197","None","False","0","hjdqeq0","False","t3_qmx2ja","False","t1_hjdqeq0","False","t3_qmx2ja","/r/AIDungeon/comments/qmx2ja/need_experts/hjdqeq0/","1646118800","5","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None",""

Take note though, I am not speaking from experience.  


Look at the Explore tab and look at the top scenarios there is there. Analyze them, study them. What makes them a good scenario? You can look for inspiration in them as well. Inspiration can help you make some good and lit ass scenarios (although not speaking from experience, this is just my opinion.)

Every good scenario never fails to amuse and attract people without their world info. If you're not that lazy or busy, then you can spend and dedicate most of your time making world info for the scenario you're making. Long scenarios you make will depend on them to stay on track with what you're going for.

If you're planning on making short scenarios, go ahead. I do suggest doing short scenarios first since they will be the foundation and the inspiration that will drive you to make more. You don't need to create some world info on short scenarios unless you need them so the AI doesn't go off-track with the theme and timeline you are in. 

Soon, your scenarios will grow and grow, and that's when you'll start thinking big. Welcome to **Worlds.** Worlds are more complicated than the usual scenarios you see in the Explore Tab. You have to add world info more than you do in the scenarios you make, as they depend on these to give the World you're creating some life and bring a more powerful immersion to the players that will see it.

I suggest adding as many world info as you can. If you run out of ideas on what to add to your World, that's the moment you will stop so it doesn't kill your braincells trying to think of information to add. Whenever that happens, look for ideas; either from your friends if one of them are interested or through the Explore tab. You can get lots of ideas from them.

Of course, you can't make Worlds all on your own without getting stressed out. You can ask for assistance from the AI Dungeon community or anyone you know who plays AI Dungeon to help you with things. The more manpower you have, the better. Just make sure you all decide on what parts of the world info will all of you focus on.

That's all. Gave my fingers some good exercise but at least I could help anyone who's planning big.

TLDR: Start small by making short and/or long scenarios, make good use of world info (especially in Worlds), and start dreaming big by making Worlds.

Make a list of choices of types of characters you want to be. Make 13 choices.

Next to each choice put ace, 2,3,4,5,6 etc representing a deck of cards.

Make a list of fantastical types of worlds that you might want to play and do the same thing.

Make a list of monsters or enemies that you want to have in the game, do the same thing.

Then make a list of the type of people you'd like to have as companions, etc.

Then when you want to start a story and you don't have any ideas, pull out a deck of cards and make a world out of the random choices that the cards make for you.

You could do the same thing with 1 to 12 using dice. But it's kind of fun to jump into one completely at random and fit the choices the dice or cards make into the story you're going to write.

When there's a city in one of my worlds, I use the same method to keep things random. In other words I put in a list of all the locations, the tavern, the city gates, the port, the castle, the shops, the sewers, etc.

So if I'm not sure what I want my character to do next I can flip a card and that's where he's headed. If the character hasn't been there yet, I create a location in world info for that random choice and then my character goes there.

Trouble

A you hear a lot of growling and screeching not far away

2 you wake to the hissing sound of a snake nearby

3 you wake up and there's a bear in your camp rummaging through your food

4 something wakes you and you slowly open your eyes without moving and look around for anything out of the ordinary

5 you wake up to the sound of rustling in the bushes

6 you wake up staring up at a man who has the tip of his sword to your throat

7 you wake up bound and tied up 

8 you wake up to the sound of a man calling out to you. He says: don't be alarmed. I'm a friendly!

9 you have a dream about a monster that you're finding impossible to kill

10 you have fitful dreams for the whole night and don't get much sleep which is going to slow you down today

J you sleep a lot longer than you intended to but wake up very refreshed so your reflexes will be good today

Q you wake up in the earth is shaking. You hear the loud stomping feet of some huge creature

K you hear a noise and wake up. You know you're being watched but by what?

I like your research about its origins.  
If you put something negative/hostile/crazy into it the AI, it will spew back even more negative and evil stuff in a pretty vicious spiral.  


Since it  is predictive in nature and tries to go with your style, it is really easy to get creepy stuff going if you know how to pull the strings, even in previously cheery or happy atmospheres where you previously were in the story/narrative.

Use a ""misc"" writing style. In this scene you are ""with whoever you're with"" ""doing whatever you're doing"". There is a ""misc"" tone in this scene.

You can combine more than one writing style. I believe you can do the same with tone like grizzly Gothic tone.

What I do in world creation may or may not be the exact way to do it but it seems to work for me.

Write a detailed description. If it's a character make sure you put what class they're in and what faction they're in.

In background put something random like: George has a bad reputation for having a hot temper. Or the city of Megapolis is a thriving community with people from all races. Or the Pandora Tavern is known for having a lot of rough characters in it and there are often bar fights.

The AI may or may not use the background to change up your detailed description a bit. It usually does.

Attributes are something I'm working on. I'm trying to create a list of attributes that work. It seems to recognize certain words as attributes and will write in what that attributes really supposed to do. They need to basically be one word attributes.

Examples that I know work pretty well...

Stealth
Sharpness
Sneak
Illusion
Mysticism
Alchemy
Quickness
Speed
Strength
Levitation

It doesn't always work, so sometimes you have to edit what the attribute does. Sometimes it puts in a number that's like six or eight digits. I have no clue what the number means but I always leave it in just in case it's a reference that the AI pulls from for the meaning of that attribute.

If someone knows more about attributes and has a more complete list of attributes, I'd sure like to know.

But if you take games, especially RPG games, where characters have certain attributes or strengths or whatever, try any of those and they should work.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-11-10-134928","1636548568","None","False","0","hk28jdc","True","t3_q6ef4z","False","t1_hk28jdc","True","t1_hjuz0b5","/r/AIDungeon/comments/q6ef4z/guide_to_ai_dungeon_styles_part_2/hk28jdc/","1646065786","1","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

But, if it's not too much of a problem, please tell me if I'm wrong:

-That sort of non narrative behavior of some published scenarios, where they serve, for example, as a preset interface with the OpenAI playground, need to be coded by the creator while editing the scenario, under the option Scripts. The coding language is Javascript.

-What I said about world info (possible formats when writing the entries, other than plain prose, to make the organization of the info more efficient -Caveman, Neanderthal, Futureman... ) perhaps led to confusion: I just came aware that it is possible to implement some code  -not on the WI but, again, in the scenario editing- so that, when running the adventure, the engine calls upon the entries of the world in a more controlled manner.

They're working on a new Griffin model that has been released.  
If I remember correctly they're also working with the Dragon continually as well as their road map for stability in Multiplayer and other things I do not remember, but are nice.  


Since they won't be looking at your unpublished things, I recommend picking a theme, poking around a bit and try getting up to some AI shenanigans.

1: defending Latitude of all things!
2: defending the energy system; it makes sense.
3: aiding and being part of the community, giving suggestions on how to use formats and edit world info and memory.
4: comparing the performance of Dragon with Sigurd and Holoai.
5: giving feedback on how Aid is currently performing.

I have spent too much time on Ai games, I agree, but I fell in love with the concept from the first try as it allowed me to escape from being a foreverDM.

I am still part of the community as I want to prevent anyone from feeling the same disappointment that I had to feel when Latitude started acting up.

But Aidungeon is sinking, the Dragon model (Model size not known.) is limited to family friendly SFW content, and you get sent (with no warning) to the poorly tuned inhouse model (This one is also filtered, even if it has no NEED to be.)

This inhouse model is the same as the one Novelai and Holoai use, but both aforementioned models are tuned to perform leaps and bounds above Griffin. With the new Sigurd V4 many claim it rivals Dragon.

The Aidungeon channel is now full of drifters and new users, the power users that created the memes and dug deep into the inner workings of the experience have left the burning ruins a long time ago.

This is sad as Aid is still the best “Get out there and tear teeth from people’s mouth!” simulator ever with a very consistent and satisfying damage mechanic.

My muscle wizard power fantasy games where fantastic with Dragon before, but so-so now.
Aid is still better at combat than Novelai or Holoai.



Latitude had a chance to redeem themselves and get back to business simply by doing exactly like Novelai and Holoai; making private stories private at the inhouse model...

With end to end encryption nobody can see what goes inn or out (This is how the others do it), and it’s an open source GTP-J model so nobody restricts it.

Instead they doubled down and filtered even the local model. (The original argument was that they where forced by Openai.)




 If Openai rejects the input you get sent to the GTP-J model. (Edit; i was misinformed, Latitude tells the player if their input has been rejected by opensi ai now. Sorry.)
So if you keep it family friendly you get the big Davinci model, and it’s all smooth sailing, but if you say no-no words then you get degraded.

Criticism towards the teams HOPELESS inability to fix even simple issues still stands; I had my world info library filled with thousands of copies of the same entries like many other users; this bug was fixed after months, months!

In memory or author’s note you have to make it clear what sort of scenario it is “Only you, Mike and Sebastian are on the base. The thing is secretly among you.”

This will prevent the AI from injecting new npc’s all the time.

Next you need an world info entry about the thing, describing it or what it should do.
And of course the base itself need an entry; “The remote base is in the middle of the arctic, isolated from the rest of the world, only you, Mike and Sebastian are here, the thing is secretly also present.”

For a brief period over the last month or so I thought Latitude was heading back towards its greatness, but what I'm observing now is that they seem to leaving Dragon alone, meaning they haven't been putting up ""Walls"" to prevent certain types of content. Almost as if they just changed their minds and lightened up about the whole damn thing. Dragon Beta on the other hand, is behaving exactly as I imagined their new ""Walls method"" would. It seems impossible to get the AI to roll in the direction I want. I am just talking about NSFW directions by the way, and not the ones that are officially banned which I don't care for anyway. I suppose it could be limitations with the AI21 Jurassic model preventing the content, but I had no trouble getting content to generate when they first made Dragon Beta available to us. So it just looks to me like they are building their walls in Dragon Beta in line with what they plan to censor moving forward. From what I've seen recently, it's like they've made a decision to wipe smut from the face of AI Dungeon completely. And it also appears they can send any user to a retarded model that can't even produce coherent output, and that they are doing so based on the type of content users are trying to have generated. It is not hard to tell when you go from Dragon output, to Griffin, Classic, or an intentionally bad custom module they made just for you because they read your unpublished stories and don't approve of your kinks. Not one little bit. Their ridicule makes this very clear. Anyway, this may not even be the right subreddit to share these observations, but I'm pretty sure I see folks in this subreddit who wanna use AID to play Dungeons &amp; Dragons, folks who wanna generate porn, and the balanced folks who like a little of both. Perhaps Latitude is just experimenting with what they can do with their walls. It is still a beta model officially and they haven't changed their content policy that I'm aware of, so I guess we'll see what they do. I'm not very optimistic though since I noticed they also took away ""Show All"" from the filter options, and as a result, shit tons of published scenarios are no longer available through search. And I haven't seen an update from them since 11/2, which contained a lot of info about recent changes and planned changes, but nothing about removing ""Show All"" unless I missed it.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-11-13-144854","1636811334","None","1636811569.0","0","hkgfqef","False","t3_pq5dz8","False","t1_hkgfqef","True","t3_pq5dz8","/r/AIDungeon/comments/pq5dz8/i_miss_ai_dungeon/hkgfqef/","1646035226","1","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

There is a great deal of information there!

Regarding your specific scenario; From experience it will be impossible to have the AI generate something so specific without scripting.

But you could explain the process in a world info entry with relevant keys like “embrace”, “turn into vampire”, “become a vampire” or similar, but expect a hundred retries.

Or like other posters have said, use story to just plainly write how the process goes if it is important for the plot, and let the AI deal with the more general story flow.

I only bought about 1-2 worlds with scales and only put in about 50 actions each before I lost interest.

If you're going to remove this post, please tell me why instead of just removing the post where I am attempting to reach out to Latitude staff and not telling my anything.  


Edit: Since the post was again, seemingly removed, I'll be posting it in the comments here.

A question regarding a community guideline change that went seemingly unnoticed.

Hello,

This is the fourth attempt I am making at reaching out to official latitude staff be it over Email or the Subreddit, in which my emails were promptly blocked and the post was removed.

So correct me if im wrong, however I specifically remember Nick, or someone else at Latitude stating that Mature / Sexual / Not-Safe-For-Work content involving incest would be allowed, so long as both parties are 18+ and consent. That’s a fair rule.

However, earlier last night I had some trouble loading into incest prompts. They weren’t gone, it was just impossible to load into anything tagged with #incest or #nsfw + \\[insert family member here\\], despite other Not-Safe-For-Work prompts loading.

At first I thought it was a bug and carried on, however after trying again a day later, it still doesn’t work. So I decided to check the community guidelines.

[This was noted under Mature and Sexual content on the community guidelines.](https://imgur.com/a/QumaYLO)

Again, id like to state that incest content was previously allowed so long as all parties were 18 years of age or older and consented. Now even if you check explore, all stories tagged with #incest (and possible other previous examples I gave) were gone, save for maybe a few outliers.

So, seeing as I have been blocked on literally every single attempt, this will be the last attempt I make publicly over trying to resolve the issue. The question I wanted to ask was this: **Was this a deliberate change to the community guidelines, even though it was previously allowed? If so, why are we not currently being told about this despite this update getting pushed nearly an entire day ago?**  
Reminder that the last time this happened was the very first time the filter was being pushed, so transparency- especially from Latitude right now, is very important.

Thanks for taking my post into consideration. I hope you will respond to me and explain the issue I'm having here.

While they are looking to swap out from OpenAI's model to AI21's to cut ties with OpenAI entirely, which is nice, it's kind of a double edged sword since AI21 also has a very... *weird* privacy policy,  Namely, they're free to store and use any user submitted  model data they like for their own purposes, even if the user requests it to be deleted.  It's a... little bit concerning that Latitude hasn't commented on AI21's privacy policies and how that'll fit into AI Dungeon, and since this is one of the major things that put them in such hot water in the first place, I don't know if they plan to in an upcoming news post or if they're going to try to sweep everything under the rug just like they did in April and run from their problems like children (since that worked out so well the last time).  We'll see.

Privacy concerns aside, the fact remains that Dragon is still one of the best AIs out there, and steps have been taken to get rid of the autobanning and make the AI actually usable again, which is what a lot of people were likely holding out for.

I don't support pedophilia in any way shape or form, and I find it reasonable that they wish to do something about it. But they've not only gotten rid of all sexual interaction, which by itself would be fine, but anything too violent. I reveled in one aspect of this app. There was no filter, anything I dreamt of could become the closest thing to reality. I would write about certain social encounters I'd had, specifically embarrassing ones, and I'd make them better, as to reduce how much I cringed at the memory. I would vent my rage and frustration via fictional violence, it worked flawlessly to quell my boiling blood without yelling, hitting something, or bottling it up until it exploded, I would never publish a story, for I wrote for myself, and this AI was my partner. I'd cook up the story and the AI would season it generously. Sometimes I'd violently harm a bully from my high school(I was just getting into high school when I had discovered this app.), then delete the story and write some wholesome, cringey fanfic, I'd write stories about worlds I'd create in my mind which had never had material form until then, some incredibly violent or sexual, others were tragic, wholesome, and sometimes bittersweet. It was my escape. Videogames and anime, as well as my newly acquired sword collection worked well to distract me from my depressing reality, but to breathe life into anything I could think of, without filter, was the best thing I'd ever had, it was everything to me, aside from friends, family, and those in between, it was the greatest thing in my life. Then, I broke my phone, I went awhile without a cellular device, the only thing with a working browser was my DS, and it couldn't run many websites, including YouTube. After a few months, I had a new phone, and I reinstalled the app, I used it from time to time, then I was introduced into a larger circle of friends, I had a girlfriend as well, I began rarely using it, only when I had a flash of inspiration. Then, I had a breakup, which was fine, until quarantine hit. Then I used the app more frequently, I couldn't interact with people much anymore. On top of that, a certain incident went down, and this app was all I had at the time to keep me at least a little happy. Then, quarantine ended finally, I had my friends back. Skipping a bit ahead, I reopen the app, ready to delve into fiction once more, but the smallest of thing would make the AI get stumped, I thought it was an error at first and reinstalled the app, but then I found out it was a content filter. I couldn't step very far out of reality anymore, nothing overly violent, nothing more than playful flirtation was permitted. And now, I'm crushed.
TLDR: I revered this app, it was the greatest thing I had, my greatest escape from reality, and now it's unusable.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-11-15-025129","1636941089","None","False","0","hko0xns","False","t3_out56f","False","t1_hko0xns","True","t3_out56f","/r/AIDungeon/comments/out56f/update_from_reddit_admins_and_new_rules/hko0xns/","1646018970","2","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

The list of featured scenarios is stale (i.e. doesn't change very much) and though new scenarios are being added to he general pool, this is very slow compared to what it was.

I have just run a search for scenarios using some really basic keywords

""Fantasy"" - shows 4 scenarios (17 when you search for tags)

""Dragon"" - shows 5 scenarios (4 when you search for tags)

""Magic"" - shows 0 scenarios (4 when you search for tags)

I would also point out that the same scenarios and authors appear across all 3 searches. Also, I have omitted searches that returned no results (thief, warrior, ranger, etc). Considering AID was based off of CYO adventures, this is pretty bad.

It does help Latitude to make improvements that affect everyone, but the AI doesn't learn on an individual level from game to game; that's just not how it works.

You can ""train"" the AI toward favoring certain plot elements by preloading your story with world info entries, memory, and an author's note, but aside from that each story begins from the same baseline until Latitude makes a training update on their end. It doesn't retain anything at all that could be transferred into your other stories.

The ""bleed through"" isn't actually that at all, but just the AI recognizing a similar input and then using that to reach the same conclusion as it did before.

For example, I see that you referenced Metroid as one of the things you've seen bleed between stories. The thing is though, the base AI has seen enough of the web to know Metroid, so whether you mean to or not your inputs are somehow guiding it towards referencing what it already knows.

EDIT: I don't actually think it's Metroid that's confusing it though, but Warhammer 40K. I don't know what it's like now, but it used to be that the AI seemed to get mixed up in fantasy stories because the sci-fi/fantasy Warhammer content it was trained on had too strong of an influence, so because of that it liked to blend genres. If it's still that way then that probably explains your issue. That's not specific to anything you're doing, though; it was like that for everyone.

EDIT 2: And according to Wikipedia ""Galactic Federation"" is used independently in nearly thirty different IPs, so it's probably a term the AI knows on its own.

Albert is a male human NPC that is in the merchant class and in the dumbass faction. Albert is 6 ft tall and extremely fat. Albert has a bald head and no hair. Albert has a friendly outgoing personality.

Notice how I was redundant with bald head and no hair? Doesn't hurt the AI for you to be a little redundant.

Obviously you can put more into the description than what I just wrote.

But you can also add that extra stuff into background. The AI will take the stuff from the background and mix it with the stuff from the description and generate the character. And then you can still edit out anything you don't like that the AI put in.

Since the name of the character is going to be in the space called info at the top of the description and assuming you're going to put the name of the character as a tag, it may not need to be in the description.

However, better safe than sorry in my opinion. That's why I repeat the name of the character often in the description and in background as well.

I haven't had the AI confused the name of the character very much at all. Whether or not it's because of my repetition or not, I don't know.

As far as repetition on the other things or redundancy, again I have no actual proof, but I do it just in case the AI understands it the way I word it one way and not understand it in another way, I'm hedging my bets.

Then at the bottom I just put to be continued...

I go into my stuff, and edit it as the ""name of my story: introduction""

Then I go to a custom prompt and click world info, then go to info tab, and add my world. Then I go to each tab and add to world for each entry in race, classes, factions, characters, etc.

Then I go back and start my chapter with a new prompt. Usually I summarize what happened in the previous chapter and a note about the chapter I'm fixing to write.


Then I write it up to a point where it makes sense to end the chapter and put to be continued...

&gt;  
&gt;You MUST be very clear when describing a character in WI. For example, ""Mario has red cap"" is a weak statement for the AI because has or have are weak connectors on the AI's eyes. If you're using has, then the AI will most likely disregard everything that is put after the word has. Instead, try something more akin to ""Mario's cap is red"". Maybe it looks the same to humans, but to AI, this is a major improvement because now it knows that the ""cap"" is associated with the color red. tl;dr: stop using has, start using is, eg ""Bob's hair is black, Mario's jumpsuit is blue""","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-11-17-193114","1637173874","None","False","0","hl0oetf","False","t3_qw0xz0","False","t1_hl0oetf","True","t1_hl0152n","/r/AIDungeon/comments/qw0xz0/question_how_to_properly_create_character_info_in/hl0oetf/","1645991859","3","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","1","[]","None","",""

And unfortunately, the Creator Program makes it seem like they're playing favorites to those who bow down to the censorship issues that brought about that terrible auto banning filter earlier in the year, no offense. It rubs people the wrong way, especially veteran users.

Maybe if the program had been going before the apocalypse happened, it'd be more popular. But it's tainted now. Also, most of the featured scenarios are bland and generic anyway. They have to be. To be family friendly, or inoffensive, or to give a 'good/clean' impression to new users.

I'm sure if they could take away the ability for anyone outside that program to publish content, without even more blowback than they've already had, they would.

The Pokemon world is a world filled with Pokemon, Pokemon are creatures of all shapes and sizes who live in the wild or alongside humans. For the most part, Pokémon do not speak except to utter their names. Pokémon are raised and commanded by their owners (called ""Trainers""). Over time, Pokémon grow and become more experienced and even, on occasion, evolve into stronger Pokémon. There are currently more than 700 known pokemon creatures that inhabit the world as well as unknown Pokemon yet to be.  
  
You are Silith, a human female made an off-hand remark and insulted one of the more prominent branch members earlier today. In a fit of rage the member kicked you out of the Team Rocket base and sent you on your way. This was your home and the only place you knew you had to go, you've lived off the scraps of stolen Pokémon food for months now. As you limp down the road your foot catches on some of the obstacles and you kick backwards in frustration. You should have kept your thoughts to yourself.  
You now find yourself on the edge of a cliff, it's a very steep drop and you're not sure you can climb back up.  
  
\\&gt; You look around.  
You search the immediate area but don't see anything useful.  
  
\\&gt; You look down over the edge of the cliff.  
You see a long and perilous drop into a forest below. You can see the bottom of the cliff is made of some sort of stone blocks and the earth below them seems broken and jagged.  
You have a backpack, in it you have some of your rations and some of the water from your flasks. You have your tinder box, a lighter, and a knife.  
  
\\&gt; You follow the cliff edge.  
You move closer to the edge of the cliff and place your feet on some of the larger rocks. Carefully you move your feet to find a toehold, but nothing can be seen below.  
  
\\&gt; You say ""What am I going to do now""  
You weigh your options and see that there is a very high chance you will fall off the edge and die.  
  
\\&gt; You start unpacking some rations to eat while thinking about your options.  
You pull out some of the ration bars and quickly scarf down the snack. You're still hungry, but not so much that you can't think straight.  
You look around and see there is no one else in sight.  
am I going to be stuck up here forever? you think to yourself .  
The next best thing you can do is figure out a way to climb down without falling. You decide to examine the stones at the base of the cliff to see if you can find any hand- or footholds.  
  
\\&gt; You look around to see if there are any vines or anything around to make into ropes.  
There are a few vines that look thick and strong enough to hang onto. You wrap one around a sturdy rock and use your knife to cut a small notch at the base of the cliff where the vine can wrap around.  
  
\\&gt; You start to repel down the cliff using the vine.  
You move quickly and carefully on the vine, but the rough bark is tough and the dirt is slippery. Your boots move slowly and you are unable to get a good grip on the dirt. As you fall, you clutch the vine so tightly your fingers turn white. You can't let go or you'll definitely get hurt. You fall and fall and fall until you can see the forest again far below you.  
The fall knocked the wind out of you and your chest burns.  
  
\\&gt; You check the extent of your injuries and assess the damage.  
You look down at your feet and see that you have scrapes on your legs and a bloody nose. At least you can walk and still have air to breathe.  
You slowly lower yourself down to the forest floor.  
  
\\&gt; You look around at your surroundings.  
You walk the perimeter of the small clearing that you landed in and look around. In the distance you can see your house and the path that leads to it.  
  
\\&gt; You walk to your house.  
You walk towards your house and see that it is small, but solidly built. There is a path that leads to it from the edge of the cliff.  
You go up to the door and reach for the handle. It is locked. Damn, that's a pain in the ass. What should you do?  
You think about it and realize you don't have a key.  
  
\\&gt; You check the windows.  
You pick up a rock and weigh it in your hand and then smash out one of the window panes. It shatters completely into thousands of small uniform pieces.  
  
\\&gt; You carefully remove any jagged pieces.  
You reach in, careful not to cut yourself, and pull out a few of the small shards.  
  
\\&gt; You once it's clear of any sharp shards clime through the window.  
You slide through the window and drop down on the other side.  
The inside of your house is as expected. There is a table with a lamp on it, a kitchen, a living area, and two bedrooms.  
  
\\&gt; You go to the kitchen and check for food.  
You go into the kitchen and look through the cabinets. You find a large knife and a lighter. Nothing else. You are about to leave when you look under the sink and find a large plastic bag.  
  
\\&gt; You replace your knife with the larger knife.  
You replace your knife with the larger one.  
Now what?  
  
\\&gt; You take the lighter and put it in your backpack.  
You light the lighter and check the contents, it's full so you stuff it in your backpack.  
You grab the bag. You feel refreshed and continue with your search.  
  
\\&gt; You go to the living area.  
You go to the living area and look around. There is nothing here that looks remotely familiar.  
You open a closet door and find...a rack of clothes?  
Well at least you found something familiar to do.  
  
\\&gt; You look at the clothes.  
You look at the clothes and realize these are all Team Rocket tunics. You change into one and then start to feel more comfortable.  
  
\\&gt; You put on a black and red plat short skirt.  
You feel more comfy in the black and red plaid skirt.  
Your mission is to capture a pokemon, not to impress the neighbors.  
You begin your search for a pokemon that nobody else has.  
  
\\&gt; You go to your bedroom.  
You go to your bedroom and lie down on the bed.  
You try to meditate to find one but nothing happens.  
No pokemon for you.  
How pathetic.  
  
\\&gt; You check your draws for any loose change to buy pokeballs with.  
Nothing.  
You look under the pillow but still nothing there.  
  
\\&gt; You check the other bedroom.  
Nothing.  
You feel around the outside of the drawers of your new found dresser but there is nothing there either.  
You look in your nightstand but once again, nothing.  
  
\\&gt; You say ""looks like I'm going to have to steal some money first""

What now?  
you think to yourself.  
Well outside the walls there are only two ways in, either through the gate or through the wild.  
You may head through the wild, it's risky but it will be a lot easier.  
  
\\&gt; You choose to enter the city via the wild.  
You decide to walk into the city.  
You don't know where you are or what direction you're walking in, you only know that you want to get as far away from your crappy little town as you can.  
Soon you are surrounded by a beautiful green field with wildflowers blooming in every color imaginable.  
  
\\&gt; You keep walking towards the nearest Poké Mart.  
Soon you can see the red and white roof of the mart in the distance.  
You quicken your pace.  
  
\\&gt; You scout out the Poké Mart.  
There are two entrances to the mart, one straight ahead of you and another to the side.  
Unless you want to spend a half hour circling the whole building and looking in windows, you'll have to pick one.  
  
\\&gt; You decide to sneak into the Poké Mart from the side entrance to steal pokeballs and supplies.  
  
You creep towards the side entrance.  
Soon, you are peering around the corner and you see a guard ahead of you.  
He's not moving.  
  
\\&gt; You look for a pebble or something to throw to distract the guard.  
  
You look all around but can't see anything that might distract the guard.  
You are going to have to risk the straight ahead entrance.  
You step out from behind the corner and into the entrance hall.  
  
\\&gt; You look around.  
  
You look around the entrance hall.  
It is a large square room with an escalator on the right and a set of doors to the left.  
  
\\&gt; You look for the pokeball section.  
You look under the counter.  
The counter has cups and small dish towels, a large bowl of apples, and a couple pokeballs.  
You grab four pokeballs, a small towel, and an apple.  
  
\\&gt; You stash the four pokeballs, a small towel, and an apple into your backpack and head towards the exit.  
  
You quietly back out of the store.  
Soon, you are out of the building and in the clear.  
You sit on a bench in the grass and pull out one of the pokeballs.  
remarking to yourself how expensive these balls would have been had you paid for them you smile with a big mischievous smile.  
""It's good to be free.""  
You feel like you are ready to take on the world.  
So why are you still sitting here?  
  
\\&gt; You decide to head towards the nearest pokemon connoisseur to find out what kind of pokemon would be a good fit for you.  
  
You limp over to the next bench over and sit down.  
You are exhausted.  
You lean back and fall into a deep thought.  
What kind of Pokemon should you choose?  
You ponder this for a long time until you hear the sound of someone coming.  
You look up and see a boy with spiky hair and a big bag walking down the path.  
  
\\&gt; You hide.  
  
You quickly hide behind a large bush.  
You watch as the boy with the bag walks up to a young girl with long brown hair who is picking through the contents of the bag.  
  
\\&gt; You watch them.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-11-19-065902","1637301542","None","False","0","hl81c9d","True","t3_qworhf","False","t1_hl81c9d","True","t1_hl816nq","/r/AIDungeon/comments/qworhf/one_of_the_funnier_parts_of_the_pokémon_world_i/hl81c9d/","1645976063","2","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

The boy is gesturing towards the bag.  
The girl reaches in the bag and pulls out a small object.  
She looks at it in her hand and says something to the boy.  
The boy nods his head and says something back to the girl.  
They are done talking and the girl puts the object back in the bag.  
The boy turns around and walks back down the path.  
The girl takes out three more objects and places them in her bag.  
This girl seems to be in deep thought.  
She doesn't even seem to be aware that you are there.  
There is something strange about her.  
You decide to follow her.  
You get up and slowly walk after the girl.  
You are still not aware of where you are going, but you are determined to find out.  
After a few minutes of walking, the girl stops and turns to you.  
You are now standing directly behind her.  
She turns around and glares at you.  
She says ""Who are you?""  
You say ""I'm just a passerby.""  
She says ""You were following me.""  
You say ""I saw you and just happened to be passing by.""  
She says ""You wouldn't happen to know how to get to Oak Wood, would you?""  
  
\\&gt; You say ""uh, no sorry I don't, why do you want to know where Oak Wood is anyway?""  
  
The girl says ""Because I need a Pokemon Trainer to help me get my sister back from the Pokemon Tower.""  
She says ""I have to go back to rescue her.""  
She says ""Will you help me?""  
You look at the girl and think about the situation.  
Will you help this girl?  
  
\\&gt; You perhaps you can, for a price.  
  
The girl seems to consider your offer.  
She asks you a question.  
What will you do?  
Will you help the girl?  
.  
  
\\&gt; You say ""well I don't have any pokemon yet but I am pretty good with picking locks, I have a large knife if you need somebody threatened and some rations left in my backpack if that helps?""  
  
The girl's eyes light up.  
She says ""Thank you so much!""  
She hugs you and runs up the path.  
You follow her  
  
\\&gt; You say ""So what happened to your sister? you said you wanted to get your sister back?""  
  
The girl turns around and says ""She is not my sister, she is my half-sister.""  
She says ""I have to get her back from the tower because she took a wrong turn and ended up in the Pokemon Tower, she is in there now and the guards won't let me past.""  
She says ""I have no way of getting past them.""  
She says ""If you can, please help me.""  
You follow the girl up the path.  
You are now walking side-by-side.  
  
\\&gt; You say ""Sounds simple enough, what is in the Pokemon Tower anyway?""  
  
The girl says ""It is a prison for Pokemon creatures.""  
She says ""They are not let out to fight, they stay in there and rot.""  
You are suddenly hit with the realization that besides the money, this is a perfect opportunity for you to get a Pokemon of your own  
  
\\&gt; You say ""Don't worry we will rescue your sister and perhaps a pokemon or two as well, by the way, what's your name, you never told me?""  
  
The girl says ""I am Elizabeth.""  
She asks ""What is your name?""  
  
\\&gt; You say ""Silith""  
She reaches out her hand to shake yours, she says ""I am glad to meet you Silith.""  
She says ""I hope you will help us.""  
She says ""The tower is straight up the path.""  
The two of you continue up the path.  
You are now at the base of the Pokemon Tower.  
The girl stops and points up the path.  
You see what looks to be a small bridge over a small gap.  
You see two guards standing either side of the gap.  
You see a rope bridge on the far side of the gap.  
  
\\&gt; You say ""I have an idea, you distract the guards, once they are on the bridge I will cut the ropes and they will fall into the rapids of the river below. then we can both enter the tower from the other bridge, what do you think?""  
  
Elizabeth smiles at you and says ""I think it is a marvelous plan!""  
She starts to turn around and heads into the tower, she calls back ""Just wait for my signal.""  
""ok, no problem"" you yell as you unpack your large knife.  
You lean up against the wall of the path and watch the girl approach the guards.  
She is very close but the guards have not noticed her.  
You hear the guards say ""What business does a girl have here?""  
The girl answers  
""Just having a look at the most smelly ugly guards in all of the land! she yells in reply, then proceeds to make a few faces while calling them slurs.  
The guards burst out into laughter and one asks ""What are you doing here, you should be at home in bed!""  
The girl says  
""I would be but your mother keeps ringing me to flick her bean! so I came to see you instead.""  
""You are sick!"" one of the guards yells back, visibly getting annoyed now  
She then retorts ""what are you going to do about it ya slack-jawed dimwits, grow fat on our tax!""  
The other guard holds up a hand and barks ""Hey, you're not allowed to talk to us like that!""  
  
Elizabeth yells back taunting them ""Your wives called me, she said I was an expert lover last night and can't believe you two never touched them like that before, I made them purr like a Meowth!""  
The guards just snicker and shake their heads.  
""What are you going to do about it?"" Elizabeth asks again, this time louder.  
The first guard looks at the other one, let's go beat some manners into this whelp""  
The guards unbuckle their batons and start walking towards Elizabeth and begin crossing the rope bridge towards her.  
""Wait!"" you yell, you've got a plan B.  
  
Elizabeth looks at you and says ""I guess it wouldn't hurt to DO IT NOW!""  
  
\\&gt; You begin cutting the ropes of the bridge the guards are crossing  
You start chopping at the ropes, you only cut through one or two ropes before the guards arrive and they are all yelling at you to stop. The only thing left to do is cut the last few strands, it would only take one swipe from your knife to cause the guards to plunge into the watery rapids below.  
""NO STOP!"" one of the guards yells clearly in a panic as the realization dawns on them  
  
\\&gt; You cut the last of the rope.  
You have your arm outstretched and are in the process of swinging your knife across the last of the rope, just as the bridge collapses with a loud THUNK and the two guards fall into the water to be carried away into the distance until you and Elizabeth can no longer see them","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-11-19-065919","1637301559","None","False","0","hl81d76","True","t3_qworhf","False","t1_hl81d76","True","t1_hl81c9d","/r/AIDungeon/comments/qworhf/one_of_the_funnier_parts_of_the_pokémon_world_i/hl81d76/","1645976062","2","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

Your high-five with Elizabeth is met with a smile and a giggle before looking at the now unguarded entrance to the Pokemon Tower  
  
\\&gt; You say ""That was hilarious! well then, shall we go find your sister""  
You and Elizabeth walk into the now unprotected tower and begin your climb up the spiral stairs. After a few minutes of climbing you reach the first landing and look around. The walls are made of bare stone with no visible doors or windows on this level. At the opposite end of the level is an arch-like opening with stairs climbing up and down on either side.  
  
\\&gt; You say ""which way? up or down?""  
Elizabeth points towards the stairs leading down.  
You begin walking towards the stairs, Elizabeth follows close behind. As you approach the bottom step, it gives way, collapsing in on itself. You and Elizabeth fall forward into the opening, hitting hard and smacking against the stone floor.  
  
\\&gt; You say ""Ouch, my fucking arse, that hurt""  
You and Elizabeth look up at the stairs on either side and see only dark shadows and blackness. The only light in the room is that coming from your fall into the room.  
  
\\&gt; You fish around your backpack for the lighter.  
You find the lighter in your bag and flick it on. It provides just enough light to see by and the flame is just strong enough to cast a shadow.  
  
\\&gt; You look around.  
The room is round and the floor is laid in a large circle. It appears to be a room used to train in the martial art of Qigong. The walls are covered with wooden charts and the lighter shows that they all appear to be concerned with the Chinese Zodiac.  
On a stand nearby is a large book.  
  
\\&gt; You pick up and read the title of the book.  
The book is called ""The Book of the Dragon."" You open it to the first page and read the words written on it.  
""The year of the Dragon... born June 8th...""  
You close the book and quickly look around the room again.  
The room has no doors or windows and no obvious exits.  
  
\\&gt; You say ""we're trapped""  
  
  
\\&gt; You grab the stand and use it to climb up through the hole you and Elizabeth fell through.  
You and Elizabeth are standing at the top of the hole with the book in your hands.  
You look at the floor of the room with the book in your hands and can't see any obvious exits.  
  
\\&gt; You put the book in your backpack and head towards the stairs leading up the tower.  
You are walking towards the spiral stairs and hear a voice coming from above. The voice appears to be calling down to you.  
""Come on up here, you stupid sacks of grass. Don't make me have to come and get you.""  
""STACY!"" Elizabeth cries as she runs up the stairs towards the voice.  
That must of been her sister you think to yourself.  
You begin running after Elizabeth, who has already reached the top of the stairs and is standing at the open doorway with her sister.  
in the room with the two sisters is a pokemon, the pokemon appears to be locked in a cage its a Pichu.  
You look into the cage and the poor little thing is cowering in the corner. It looks like it is trapped in a corner of the room, unable to move.  
  
\\&gt; You say ""Hold on little Pichu, I'll get you out of there, just give me a minute to pick these locks""  
You walk over and pick the locks on the cage door.  
The Pichu begins to squeal in delight and leaps into your arms.  
  
\\&gt; You say ""yeah ok, ok, let's not make a big thing of this,"" you say clearly not used to such affection  
  
  
\\&gt; You say ""so, ya wanna be my first pokemon Pichu?""  
  
The Pichu looks at you and you quickly realize that you don't have a clue how to care for a pokemon. The Pichu hops off and runs over to a corner of the room.  
you turn to the sisters Elizabeth and Stacy, we should get out of here before any guards come back, I've no idea how far the rapids took them and I wouldn't want to be chased down by angry wet guards.  
You hear a clatter as the Pichu leaps into a dresser drawer. It hides there until it hears your voices and then pops out.  
The Pichu appears, jumpy like and tries to run at you, you step back in fear thinking that it's going to attack.  
instead to your surprise, it climbs up your leg and jumps into your backpack.  
You sigh in relief and pat the spot where it was hiding.  
You turn and see Elizabeth and Stacy running towards you with their arms outstretched with tears in their eyes.  
You smile and accept their hugs.  
the three of you leave the tower and head into the city together, you smile at the thought that you've finally got your first pokemon  
sitting down on the grass now with the two sisters you look over at Elizabeth and say ""wow, today, was pretty fun, a bit scary but exciting""  
Elizabeth smiles and nods.  
Stacy says ""yeah, I've never seen a Pichu before and it was really neat to see one""  
  
\\&gt; You say ""there is one little matter left to discuss, the matter of payment""  
You turn to Elizabeth and smile.  
You have a discussion about money with her.  
You say ""I was going to rob you after this, but seeing as I had such fun, maybe we can be friends instead, perhaps we can even go on another adventure again sometime, after watching you taunt those guards and how funny it was, I want to capture pokemon with you and see the world""  
Elizabeth says ""well, I was going to say that I want my payment up front, but the offer is good""  
You laugh and raise an eyebrow.  
You say ""but of course""  
You shake hands and seal the friendship with a kiss on the forehead, the three of you then part ways for the night.  
later on that night in bed you think back to the events on the day and are quite pleased with your decision.  
You'll look forward to adventuring with your new best friend, Elizabeth.  
You are still a gang member of Team Rocket but you figure why not try out this friend thing too, today was fun and you were way more successful with help than you have been in the past when you were working alone. Perhaps she might even help you pull off a few robberies  too, though that isn't your primary goal right now.  
  
You fall asleep planning your next adventure with Elizabeth.  
The next day you wake up and hear Elizabeth whispering to herself ""is she a member of team rocket? she was wearing a shirt with a big red R on it after all""","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-11-19-070100","1637301660","None","False","0","hl81iq8","True","t3_qworhf","False","t1_hl81iq8","True","t1_hl81d76","/r/AIDungeon/comments/qworhf/one_of_the_funnier_parts_of_the_pokémon_world_i/hl81iq8/","1645976052","2","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

You quickly jump out of bed and do a full-body stretch before sitting down on your haunches and saying ""I am""  
Elizabeth gasps and says ""no you're not""  
  
\\&gt; You say ""Yeah, it's true, I am a member of team rocket, just a grunt and not very good at it, but it's a living, I was kicked out of one of the hideouts near here after I insulted one of the more prominent branch members there. Then I met you, you said I was following you and I lied and said I was just a passerby. Guess I can tell you the truth now that we are friends, I was going to rob you until we went on that adventure to save your half-sister""  
Elizabeth slowly gets up and sits down next to you.  
She says ""So that's why you were following me then, I knew it.""  
You laugh ""Well, yeah""  
  
\\&gt; You say ""Listen, I still have to make money so, wanna help me like yesterday? I was thinking of using Pichu to hold up a convenience store in order to steal some money, with you and pichu by my side I bet we could make a lot of money! ""  
Elizabeth says ""I can't help you with that, I am a gypsy.""  
You sigh and look at her sideways, this is very surprising.  
  
\\&gt; You say ""a gypsy?""  
Elizabeth says ""I have been traveling the lands since I was born, my entire family is a gypsy clan, it is something I have been able to do since I was little""  
  
\\&gt; You say ""how do you make a living?""  
Elizabeth says ""It's a difficult question, I don't know how to make money as you do, I go from town to town and sing for money""  
  
\\&gt; You say ""Oh, I see... what if you distracted people by singing while I pick their pockets?""  
Elizabeth says ""Ha ha, boy you have a lot of potential, I'll let you try that one out first""  
You get dressed and wait outside for Elizabeth.  
When she arrives she walks up to you and asks ""What do you think about distracting people with a song?""  
You think for a moment and then say  
  
\\&gt; You say ""yeah let's try it!""  
Elizabeth says ""Pichu, sing a song to help me!""  
Pichu comes to life and begins to sing.  
  
\\&gt; You laugh.  
Elizabeth says ""You look like you're enjoying that, sing something for me!""  
Pichu continues to sing.  
You feel like you're actually beginning to enjoy this.  
Elizabeth says ""What do you think about using your gift to help distract people while your master robs them, Pichu?  
Pichu makes Pichu noises, you gather it's tone indicates it's up for the challenge.  
You say ""Let's do it!""  
Elizabeth says ""I knew you had potential, you'll be my special helper!""  
later that day outside the convenience store  
You and Elizabeth walk up to the store. Pichu stands in the corner twiddling his tail.  
As you approach the store's glass doors you notice a few customers inside.  
  
\\&gt; You say ""perfect, it's showtime, start singing and I'll go around and pickpocket the customers while you two distract them with your singing""  
Elizabeth says ""Good plan, go for it!""  
Pichu starts to sing.  
You move from doorway to doorway, making sure you're in the clear and that Pichu is keeping the song up.  
  
\\&gt; You look at the first customer.  
You look at the first customer, a woman with long black hair tied back in a ponytail. She's wearing a blue striped shirt with a green jacket over it.  
  
\\&gt; You begin carefully pickpocketing the pockets of her green jacket.  
You move quickly and quietly, barely even taking your eyes off the customer.  
You manage to get your hand in her pocket without her noticing, you then transfer everything in her pocket to your own.  
  
\\&gt; You move onto the next customer.  
You move onto the next customer, a man in a grey hoodie, he's carrying a green bag.  
You look at his pockets, but he's not a sitting duck.  
  
\\&gt; You begin slowly reaching into the green bag trying not to alert the man to your thievery.  
You slowly reach into the bag and fish around for a few moments before you feel a large coin purse. You quickly grab the large coin purse and race back to Elizabeth before the man even notices that his coin purse is missing. You give the coin purse to Elizabeth without even opening it.  
Elizabeth says ""We earned that, time to split!""  
You and Elizabeth quickly jog to the edge of the crowds and disappear into the thick of it.  
You continue pickpocketing until you and Elizabeth have made your way to the edge of the crowd.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-11-19-070113","1637301673","None","False","0","hl81jee","True","t3_qworhf","False","t1_hl81jee","True","t1_hl81iq8","/r/AIDungeon/comments/qworhf/one_of_the_funnier_parts_of_the_pokémon_world_i/hl81jee/","1645976051","2","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

\\&gt; You meet up with Elizabeth outside.  
Elizabeth is standing by the edge of the crowd, she has a mischievous grin on her face and her hair is tied back in a ponytail.  
You say ""Let's go!""  
Elizabeth says ""Yes, let's go buy something with this coin""  
You and Elizabeth head for one of the shops nearby.  
  
You and Elizabeth both move quickly in a happy sprint towards the shop. Inside there is a bored looking salesgirl, a bored looking customer, and a bored looking coin machine.  
  
\\&gt; You look around the shop.  
You look around the shop, it's a small shop, only has the two bored people in it. The wall to the left is covered in shelves and shelves of various items.  
  
\\&gt; You examine the various item.  
You carefully examine the various items on display. There are a variety of different items, all of them useless and some of them dangerous.  
There is a large section of book here, they are all on ""Pokemon Training"".  
You are reminded the of book you stole the other day from the pokemon tower and decide to try and sell it to the bored-looking sales girl.  
You move closer to the bored sales girl...  
The sales girl looks at you and says ""Hmmm... How can I help you?""  
  
\\&gt; You say ""uh, yeah, I got a book here called The Book of the Dragon, how much coin can I get for it?""  
The sales girl thinks about your question for a few second and says ""You wanna sell it or keep it?""  
You stare at her in confusion before she starts to grin, she says ""I've got a hunch on what you have there, you wanna sell it or not?""  
You think the girl is trying to get you to say ""No!""  
  
\\&gt; You say ""I wanna sell it""  
The sales girl grins and says ""Alright, alright, I'll give you 80 silver for it.""  
You look at the book and see that it's an old edition.  
  
\\&gt; You say ""deal!""  
The sales girl counts out 80 silver coins and hands them to you.  
You look at the book and see that it's an old edition.  
You say ""What's the catch?""  
The sales girl says ""No catch, just try to make a buck. Now go on, get outta here.""  
You stare at the girl for a few second and then walk out of the shop.  
you meet up with Elizabeth to count your money...  
You are now standing in a street full of people. The people here are quite a diverse crowd, there are a wide array of races and ages.  
You count out your coins to Elizabeth.  
Your 80 silver coins makes your stack total 100.  
You look around at the people walking by, they all look so happy and carefree.  
  
\\&gt; You say ""ok, fifty coins for you and fifty coins for me""  
Elizabeth smiles and says ""Deal!""  
You hand over the coins to Elizabeth.  
Elizabeth counts out the coins and smiles  
  
\\&gt; You say ""Let's hit the road""  
Elizabeth nods and says ""Let's go!""  
You walk down the street side by side.  
You come to a large tree and lean against it  
You stare up at the bright blue sky.  
You can't remember the last time you felt so happy  
You breathe in the fresh air.  
  
\\&gt; You say ""how many days walk till the next town you think?""  
Elizabeth looks up at the sky and says ""It'll be easy days walking. We can make this trip in no time.""  
You stare at the sky for a few minutes. Then you look over at Elizabeth and smile.  
  
\\&gt; You say ""so what's the name of the next town anyway?""  
Elizabeth smiles and says ""Corktown.""  
You stare at her in surprise.  
Corktown is a large town with a history of violence and poverty.  
  
\\&gt; You say ""Corktown? is there anyone even worth robbing there?""  
Elizabeth shrugs.  
""Who knows? We'll see.""  
You stare at her for a few minutes, then you look up at the sky and sigh deeply.  
You start walking towards the town of Corktown.  
You start walking down the sidewalk of the street.

Basically made me not even have children in any story I write even if it's just a mention of a family and their child.

But most of my stories don't really need children in them anyway so it doesn't bother me.

But for some people, they like writing stories with families in them. IMO, AI dungeon is not for anyone under 18 to play, nor for characters under 18. It just doesn't handle that very well.

Although it's never happened to me, I do know people it's happened to people that we're not writing CP.

What bothered me was that they broke their own promise to not read private stories. If they had made an announcement that things were going to change, that would be one thing. But they did not. They just broke their promise, started reading, and said nothing until way later.

Look dude. I get it. You're skeptical of how it is. hell, at least Half of the people in this sub would probably rather dig their own grave and jump in it than believe Latitude are capable of telling the truth anymore. And you know what? By now, i don't care, they can go for it, Because  not a single word i say is likely ever gonna change their minds. But like a lot of other people, I believe in second chances and are willing to give them a shot to prove they're not just another bunch of greedy A-holes like EA or Ubisoft. They've at least proven capable of Reaching a compromise with the community to fix the game's biggest flaws while still keeping that Jank-ass filter OpenAI demanded.

Speaking of the filter, I have a question to pose for you regarding it. The Reason they even read the stories in the first place was so they could monitor content OpenAI would not be happy with and get rid of it. Not saying the system was good, I think it fucking sucked too, But it made sense as to why they did it. (And outsourcing the stories to other people was not on Latitude to blame, That was on OpenAI.) With the new system, Your input isn't even flagged, The Ai just reroutes whatever output it has to a safer version, or asks you to change what you put, Temporarily locking the story down. So if the Ai itself is now filtered and can easily prevent the type of content neither them Nor OpenAI were okay with, (Also, Their unwanted content list is way smaller than OpenAI's.) Then **WHAT POSSIBLE REASON** would they even have to read them now? Only answer i can think of is boredom, And they haven't proven themselves **that** Low.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-11-22-005909","1637539149","None","1637539347.0","0","hlkqcop","False","t3_qylwcp","False","t1_hlkqcop","False","t1_hljs4py","/r/AIDungeon/comments/qylwcp/can_the_mods_read_your_aidungeon_adventure/hlkqcop/","1645948862","7","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

I said on my last comment some people on here would sooner dig their fuckin' grave and climb in it before believing Latitude can be truthful. Yeah, This proves you're one of those people too.

I give multiple reasons why i would trust them and one reason they wouldn't even need to read private stories anymore, and you choose to completely ignore what i wrote apparently, And be the petty asshole and downvote my comment (Go ahead, downvote this one too, know you're gonna.)

We'll see about that.

&gt;The essays you write don't pay them. 

Do you people not realize not everyone can put their thoughts and points into a short sentence or two? In arguments you debunk counterpoints and use evidence. If you'd read long enough you'd know that.

&gt;The 'asshats' who are still mad used to. 

You don't say. And a lot of those same people are ready to forgive them **BECAUSE** they fixed their fuckups...most of them, anyway. Still got a lot to do.

&gt;That's why they're removing parts of the service to desperately try to save on costs.

SOURCE, PLEASE? Pretty sure they cut out classic mode because nobody used it (It was less coherent than Griffin.) but whatever, if money was an issue theyd've probably said so, not that you would believe that. If you're gonna say it's a money thing,  **Source it.**

Edit: Found a source. Yeah classic was cut partly to save on costs, But not because of a money problem. As said, nobody used it. Why keep a feature that adds extra cost when it won't be used?

&gt;And the crazy part is you love them this much and you've never experienced Dragon. 

**I'M FUCKING BROKE.** that's why i never went to NovelAi before the new approach they took. Same as many others that stuck around. But with the new approach i see no reason to leave. Nor do i see a reason you two DON'T leave, seeing as you hate them so much.  Also find it stupid that you two seemingly have a problem with anyone paying Lat or supporting thrm in any way, yet sticking to griffin and not paying them shit is apparently a ""Gotcha"". Make your damn minds up, Should i pay them or not? Can't have it both ways.

Edit: Knew they were gonna get mad and downvote me, lol. Like it matters, They can't even argue right, And everybody that still plays AID knows it's good again now (though not free of the occasional bug.) Their downvotes don't mean shit. If they hate AID and latitude as much as they do, why don't they just fucking leave and go play something else?

As the other commenter mentioned, remember is important. The AI can only remember so much information and it gives priority to the information you put in remember. So the things that you really need the AI to remember, like your name for instance, goes in remember.

Below that you have styles. That's where you want to give it the writing style for starters.

These are two Google docs I made to help cut down some of the confusion about writing styles, author's note, tone and everything that you can put into Styles in AI dungeon.

Part one covers writing styles

https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/q6e30c/guide_to_ai_dungeon_styles/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

Part two covers mood and tone and all of that.

And now let me complicate things a little further for you. World info is important as well.

You go to worlds, my worlds, create world. And create world give your world a name and write a description of what's in that world or what that world is all about including anything about time setting like it's a medieval story or whatever.

Go through each tab and create races, locations, classes, factions, etc. Write detailed descriptions about the locations and factions and everything.

When you've done all that, go to prompts, custom, then click the little world info button before you write a prompt.

Go to the info tab. Your world should be there. Quick add to world next to it. Now your world is active.

But you have to do this under each tab. Under races, for each race there's that same little button to make it active. Under classes, factions, locations, for each item there's that little button to add to world to make it active.

Now you need to create your characters, including yourself. Give details about each character, what they look like, what class and faction they're in, what their personality is like, What skills they have, etc 

Then generate character. Then go down and open the character. Put in tags that refer to the character, like for yourself, you put in the tag for your name and put in a tag that says ""you"".

For each character you'll see the description that you wrote and then you'll see the description above it that the AI put in that might include some of the things you put into background.

Below that you'll find attributes. Attributes are kind of cool. Use some of the standard attributes that come with other role playing games and such.

Like if you put in the attribute ""illusion"" and hit generate or add or whatever, it will describe the ability to create illusions magic.

You can also add things like: sneak, lock picking, pickpocketing, mysticism, healing, marksmanship and others. Experiment with it 

It also doesn't always work when generating an attribute. So you may have to go in and edit whatever the AI wrote for attribute and describe that skill yourself.

Once you've done all of that, you'll find that the AI stays on track almost all the time.

I get the practical aspects. Blocking some of the retries you get means you spend energy faster if you are the type to retry a lot. And generating retries takes time, so the system essentially runs slower. Whether there's any reason to expect differences in response quality... I don't see any? The filter tries to detect child porn, not high-quality outputs, and I guess there's a reason to expect those to be correlated if the story itself is also child porn (so a coherent extension to it is also child porn), but not otherwise.

But I'm not sure you're even interested in that?

The point I was getting at is the (flawed) filter is still there, and to pretend otherwise is being misleading.  

I'm trying to say nothing has changed from three months ago, except now it hides behind a veil of smoke and mirrors. If you, like myself, were unhappy back then, then I believe we still have good reason to be unsatisfied. 

I urge everyone to think about the quality of the outputs you are getting, even in benign situations. *Especially* in benign situations. Ask yourself if what I say makes sense.

- Put the player character's name, species, and description in the memory (placeholders do work there)... and preferably write the memory in the same tense and character as the prompt
- Take out the part in the description that you copied from the prompt. Very short scenario descriptions are great, I try to at least hit below 400 characters, and the more concise the better.

Usually I would complain about scenarios with a ton of placeholders, but this one's pretty well-designed in that you can just give one-word answers to everything and so they go by pretty fast.

However, I do need help with knowing how it would be like if it were to be like...; certain versions of generations? like...; remakes, ROMHacks, or even a different story; just with the general concept in mind.

*Example: I've always wanted to make a story to where Snow on Mt. Silver is connected to Lost silver; but, with a certain plot twist that could make it more interesting; like, for example; another character searching for this other one through Their Johto team, and surprisingly; they have a Gen 3 Pokemon on their team. Not only that; They have 2 Gen 2 Pokemon that have Gen 4 evolutions.  The world in general? It combines all generations together. 1-8 (and 9, when it releases.)*

This concept is more of my own personal idea, and I want to see what AI dungeon would do with that info in mind. \\^\\^;  


Quick Edit: Soul Silver's version of Mt. Silver has a Dawn stone, as an example.

If I can’t de-radicalise white supremacists, then I could at least turn them to a more productive form of supremacy that promotes the survival of our species rather than its destruction.

That said, persecuting people for being true to themselves is *never* the answer, not only because it’s a shіtty thing to do, but also because *it doesn’t work*. “Mere” persecution rarely stays that way; as the basis for persecution is fear, demonisation and dehumanisation is inevitable…and has already happened. On the other side, stigmatisation leads to isolation which, contrary to popular belief, does *nothing* to reduce the incidences of chіld abuse; as fear of ostracisation increases, fewer paedophiles will be inclined to seek help, professionally or otherwise. Therefore, I must oppose any action that hinders this population from receiving the help and support they need.

In addition, the majority (roughly 70-80%) of chіld sex abusers aren’t even attracted to chіldren.

The Latitude AI variants are still filtered, but differently than what it was originally. Now, you don’t get in trouble (unless you publish prohibited stuff I think).

If the AI triggers the filter, it'll try to generate a different response that *doesn't* trigger the filter, or you may get an error message telling you to take the story in a different direction if the AI can't manage to generate something that doesn't trigger the filter.

The filter is also generally nowhere near as bad as before, and with it now only applying to the AI, it's pretty much unnoticeable for me. Even when intentionally trying to trigger the filter, I've never personally seen the error message that tells you to take the story in a different direction. There are no longer manual reviews of content that triggers the filter, and you can no longer be suspended or banned for private content.

There's also the OpenAI filter, but the OpenAI filter is entirely silent and doesn't tell you when it's triggered. At the moment, the OpenAI filter presumably only applies to the normal Dragon model, since that's the only OpenAI model available, as Griffin and Dragon-Beta both use non-OpenAI models (side note, since you apparently haven't used AID in a while, Griffin *used* to use OpenAI's GPT-3 Curie model, but now uses GPT-J 6B, made by EleutherAI). Triggering the OpenAI filter temporarily switches you to a non-OpenAI model, and triggering the OpenAI filter *too* much can essentially get you banned from using OpenAI models.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2021-11-29-020643","1638148003","None","False","0","hmh1twt","False","t3_r4brxe","False","t1_hmh1twt","False","t1_hmfofl2","/r/AIDungeon/comments/r4brxe/the_state_of_ai_dungeon/hmh1twt/","1645879649","23","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

Well, Griffin might be weaker, but my experience with Dragon is that it's strong enough at understanding character motivation that it should be able to pick up on everyone being pointlessly suicidal/dumb. What even Dragon *won't* be very good at is keeping track of who's dead/maimed/etc. and who isn't, and Griffin is going to be even worse at it, so expect the model to be confused about that a lot.

AI Dungeon can have many hiccups, but it is still way more enjoyable in my opinion, even just using Griffin.   
Dreamily is basically Griffin without the ability to play a good Fantasy or Sci-Fi world.  
It can try, but without World Info (I realize saying this part is silly because most of my playthroughs devolve because oh how I play) it can have an even harder time following me and my nonsense actions.   


I would rather stick with AI Dungeon as they fine tune their stuff, they have already laid out a Road Map for themselves to follow, and for us to look forward to.  


In addition to the above stated things, I know nothing about how Dreamily will push forward, and have less interest in their formatting. I wish them well all the same.

Energy is still there, you can adjust if you see it at all or if you see it at certain depletion points in the settings.  


I believe it recharges at a rate at 1 energy every 5 minutes up to 100 energy and 1 energy every 20 minutes after 101 and so on up to a maximum of 2000.  
I have mine set to show at all times the numbered value of my remaining energy.
