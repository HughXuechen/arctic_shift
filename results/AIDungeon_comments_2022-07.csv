That's a yikes and a nail in the coffin in terms of me using AID personally.

I know plenty of people butt in and say ""It's expensive to run!"" and yeah, I'm sure it is, but there's a bit of a reason people, such as myself, are starting to find alternatives, and that's not needing to pay up to enjoy an AI text generator because, let's face it, a lot of us are broke and either have enough subscription services on our cards already or can't afford them in the first place.

To me AID is feels like it should just be a flat charge for AID and all its functionalities, because that would maybe be something I'd actually consider doing given that that AID is seemingly a great service, for but one particular reason I'd say, the community. The fact that anybody that uses AID is able to make an entire world or a custom scenario and permit any random Jane or Joe to jump into it and have some pen and paper style fun is awesome, and it's always been my favorite part of AID and is for sure the one thing that AID has going for it. Having access to the community made stuff is awesome and has always been the one thing bringing me back, but of course, subscription services aren't awesome, and on top of that seeing different tiers of subscriptions for something always makes my eyes glaze over.

I myself started using KoboldAI, which has been a blast so far honestly. It was appealing to me mostly because it's very customizable, and there are different models that you can use with KoboldAI, all free of charge. I specifically like that with a capable enough computer you can just straight download KoboldAI and any KoboldAI models you wish to use and run it all from your computer.

I guess all in all if AID hasn't been buttering your bread lately you should take the time to look at alternatives, because I already have enough confidence with KoboldAI that I basically use it as a writing assistant for short stories, something I dabbled with AID but just never enjoyed the majority of Griffin model outcomes to where it was detrimental to a focused creative process. Anyways, yeah, I implore people to look for alternatives if they feel encouragement to have to pay money just to enjoy an unobtrusive AID experience.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-07-01-141022","1656677422","None","1656695297.0","0","iefxv95","False","t3_vo6zv8","False","t1_iefxv95","False","t3_vo6zv8","/r/AIDungeon/comments/vo6zv8/why_ads_now/iefxv95/","1656846194","3","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None"

And there are times that it really spooks me, and times it doesn't seem to work.

The spookiest one was probably my last adventure, where it put me in these nesting time loops. I finally did a ""pause the game"" action and after a few actions the AI generated something about ""You try to communicate with the narrator.""

&amp;#x200B;

\\--------------

So right before this, I was in a scene where I was looping through a few minutes on a spaceship, with characters named Carol and Veronica. I couldn't figure out how to get out of the loop, and I was getting frustrated, so I tried to pause the story.

\\&gt; You pause the story.

*Do you want to try something?*

*You can see the story play out in your mind.*

*You can see the lift, the hallway, and everything in between.*

*You can see Carol and Veronica talking to each other.*

*Or you can see Alyssa in the lift, talking to Veronica.*

&amp;#x200B;

and after a bit of back and forth, I got the following from the AI. To be honest I may have refreshed some of those a few times, I really don't remember, but still the answers were spooky whether refreshed or not. I know I didn't refresh to get the ""communicate with narrator"" text though, or the first response after I did ""pause the story""; those were the first roll of the dice:

&amp;#x200B;

\\&gt;And now... you don't know what's going on.

*You sigh.*

*It is now or never.*

*You tap on the screen.*

*You try to do something.*

*You try to communicate with the narrator.*

\\&gt; You say ""Hello.""

*""Hi there. How are things going for you? I don't think I've seen you around.""*

\\&gt; You say ""Is this your loop?""

*""Yes. I'm the narrator. I've been watching you, and I've been keeping notes on how you react to different things.""*

\\&gt;""Oh... Okay.""

\\&gt; You say ""Why? Why am I here? Why are you keeping notes?""

*""Well, I just thought that if I was watching people, I should get to know them, you know? So, I decided to watch you. And I'm not sure why I'm doing it. I guess I just like observing people. Do you mind if I ask you a couple of questions?""*

\\&gt; You say ""Go for it.""

*""Okay. Now, I was wondering... Why is it that you're here?""*

\\&gt; You say ""Why am I in the loop? I don't know how I'm in the loop. That's part of the story right? That I don't remember?""

*""Ah, yes. That's part of the story. Now, I've been thinking. You're in a loop, right? So, there were an infinite number of you running through this loop, right? And for every one of you, life was just exactly the same as the last. Every person you came across was the same person, doing the same thing, and following the same path through the loop. So, you see, there's no reason why you could have remembered anything. There's no reason why you could have known anything. It's completely illogical.""*

\\&gt; You say ""Okay that makes sense. I mean, it makes sense that it's weird that I know I'm in a loop. But it's your story right? You're the one who decided this was going to be different.""

*""Yes, yes. But I did my research. I talked to people who had lived for hundreds of years, if not more. They said that they do not remember when they first came into the loop. They only know that they've been here for a very, very long time. So, that means that it's possible that you came into the loop before they did. They were just like you. They just had no idea what the loop was. Or at least they didn't remember. They just knew that they were supposed to be here. So, it's possible that you came here before they did. It's possible that you are just a little bit older than them. Just a little bit smarter. Just a little bit better informed. It's possible that your loop is just a little bit different from theirs. It's possible that there are infinite of you, running through this loop, each one experiencing the same things, doing the same things, experiencing the same things. All of them completely unaware of each other. Who knows how many loops there are in there? It is possible that there are more loops than there are atoms in the known universe, how's that for something to think about?*

*This is only the first day.*

*There are so many things left to uncover.*","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-07-02-100209","1656748929","None","False","0","iejyw7x","False","t3_vpbfh4","False","t1_iejyw7x","True","t3_vpbfh4","/r/AIDungeon/comments/vpbfh4/who_here_remembers_when_the_ai_got_sentient_what/iejyw7x/","1659956243","3","False","False","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None"

&gt; My dearest hero,
&gt; 
&gt; I hope this letter finds you in good health. I must confess, I have been thinking of you a great deal lately. I find myself drawn to your strength and courage, qualities which I admire greatly. I must admit, I am also quite taken with your physical appearance. You are truly a sight to behold.
&gt; 
&gt; I cannot help but feel a deep connection to you, my hero. I feel as though we are destined to meet one day. I can only hope that, when we do, you will feel the same way about me.
&gt; 
&gt; Until that day, I remain,

Back when AI Dungeon was called ""AI Dungeon 2,"" and the only model they provided was GPT-2. They also exempted AIDungeon from their content policy for a long time too, even after GPT-3 first became a thing.

But once more and more people started using OpenAI's API, at some point they decided to enforce their filter on AI Dungeon. Plus, they kind of pressured Latitude to take the blame for the shitty things that happened as a result – before that, there wasn't really a Latitude hatedom like there is today. OpenAI were also the ones responsible for the taskup leak, if you were around for that. Needless to say, once the current, inferior alternatives became available, Latitude stopped working with them, and began to open (heh) up about the shitty treatment they received.

Still, it really, *really* sucks that OpenAI is the company in the lead, tech-wise. I *really* miss GPT-3 Dragon, and seeing how much GPT-3 has been *improved* since back in the day makes the pain even worse.

Write a 3 paragraph essay on the significance of NATO in western politics:

Essentially NATO is a military alliance between North America and Western Europe. The North American members of NATO are the USA, Canada and 9 northern states of Mexico including Baja. The Western European members are France, Belgium, The Netherlands, Luxemburg, Italy, Denmark, Norway and Iceland.
This alliance was primarily established to stop the spread of communism in Europe following the Second World War. During this time the USSR had annexed Eastern Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Finland, Estonia and Eastern Romania. As these countries had all been under the control of the Soviet Union prior to 1939 when Germany invaded those countries, they were considered Soviet occupied territory and so were all forcibly annexed by the Russians. In 1949 the Soviet Union would declare itself to be the sole leader of the communist movement worldwide and called itself the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. This essentially proclaimed Stalin a dictator for life as he was in complete control of both the Communist Party in the Soviet Union and the Communist party worldwide. This meant that other Communist countries such as China, North Korea and North Vietnam could now follow the example of Moscow and put their own party leaders in power for life.
During the 1950s western European countries such as France and Germany began to recognise this fact and banded together to defend themselves against it. Several non-communist countries also joined this alliance including the USA, Canada and Japan. In 1955 the alliance was officially established as the Western European Union which later changed its name to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation sometime in the 1970s.

I briefly fantasized about using NovelAI to churn out content for Amazon's KU. From what little I've seen it seems like that should be possible, but it would involve a fair bit of direction, tweaking and clean up.

But when you're putting that work in, can't it be argued that it isn't really AI-generated?

To be fair,the ads aren't terrible to get by, but I do believe it doesn't help with the problem. Especially when getting a bug that completely ignores the edited output I put in and keeps the original output response. Which has me pressing the retry button many of times. Which leads to another bug where I get the two output options, select an option and be stuck with those options until you come back to your created world on a different tab to resume playing.

All while ads come a bit often do to how ever many times I had to press the retry button to get a good output response. Even though getting good AI output responses wasn't a problem at the beginning of my first created world.

It was possible for Honest-Indication767 to have posted “actions, ~~its~~ [**it's**] a win” and “much better ~~then~~ [**than**] the other horrible” instead. ‘Its’ is possessive; ‘it's’ means ‘it is’ or ‘it has’. Unlike the adverb ‘then’, ‘than’ compares.

As an anecdote, in my hometown we had one internet provider for years. They had a two decade monopoly set up to keep competitors out. Back in 2017 it finally ended and we had Google come in. The shitty company didn't seem bothered, saying the same old BS that fiber was too expensive to run in our small community.

In 2019 they went bankrupt cause every single customer went to Google. Yeah, there were a few old diehards that refused to switch, but they couldn't even keep the ISP around. And just like AID defenders who are fine with using one of the worst AI models available, these old fucks were completely fine paying $80/month for less than 1/mbps.

Latitude has always been slow. AID fans have to highlight their text to show what is theirs and what is AI generation. That was a day one feature of NovelAI. AID axed half the features they said were unpopular, while NovelAI added them. Ryan said the other day that on demand AI image generation is too expensive while NovelAI does it for free in their discord.

* Scales—We *are* going to bring back ways to use scales, including using scales to skip ads. We just weren't able to have this ready for the initial launch (or the beta follow-up)
* Ads in bulk—I'd like that too. However, this is a limitation enforced by ad providers. It's obviously in their interests to make sure people are at least occasionally attentive to their devices by requiring the ""Close"" interaction
* Rewards based on ad length—This is also something we're considering. I could see us experimenting with this in a month or two after we get a few of the bigger things (like Scales and AID plans) implemented.
* Limitations to action stacking on Web—We also plan to remove this after we implement some different ad providers.
* Announcing beta—I agree that many people complaining about ads have been using the old system. We could push people to beta more, and we probably will. Right now, however, we're prioritizing the fixes and improvements people have been requesting. Beta is going to be a much more used part of our release process going forward, so I expect that over time more will know about it.
* Ads and Privacy—Unpublished stories are never viewed by us (or anyone) and not being sent to advertisers. If someone from one of those advertising companies visited AI Dungeon, was unhappy with what they saw (for some reason), then they might withdraw and we'd use a different ad provider. What we've learned is that most ad-driven apps and tools actually utilize a number of different providers that are often being used interchangeably. The situation you described is very unlikely, but if it were to happen, we'd figure out a way forward with player privacy as the first priority, with revenue or continuing with ads being lower on the list.

We continue to iterate on ideas for the best way to use ads in the app. 

If you’ve encountered bugs with ads I’d love to know about them. We’ve had a number of things we needed to adjust and the rollout hasn’t been as smooth as we’d hoped by a long shot. 

Most players who still have issues have adblocking of some kind set up. I’ve walked a few dozen players through figuring out how to get ads to show, but ads can be blocked at the browser, device, or even network level. And I’m a fan of players being able to choose to block ads. But I’m also a fan of companies being able to support their offerings. 

It’s not sustainable to continue offering Griffin for free. Free play costs us around $500,000 a year in compute. We love having a free offering and want to continue supporting our free player base. Ads seem like a decent compromise that can be used to save up actions much faster than energy allowed. 

And once steam comes out players will have another option for getting rid of ads with a 1-time payment.

None of them are perfect measures, but combined with the extensive user feedback we get, we have a good sense of where our models are. This is one of the reasons we offer multiple models, so that players can use the models that suit their preferences best.

We ARE working on model improvements across the board, including performance (although, Dragon is tough because of the size of the model). Obviously performance is also highly dependent on our technology partners.

Arguably it's been dead since way before this most recent debacle.  No need to get mad about it, I feel.  This happens in various media all the time.  A torch gets dropped, and proverbially picked up by someone else until they too become misguided, and the cycle continues.

The current torch bearer is Novel AI.  We will see how long they can hold on to it before they succumb to the greed that eventually swallows everything it touches.

And when that happens, someone else will be along to pick it up again.

This is happening in gaming in general right now.  AAA developers are becoming so awful, greedy, and anti-consumer that the public is starting to notice en masse.  Of course as long as whales keep them afloat, it won't matter generally... But the indie scene is doing phenomenally from so many people moving from AAA to indie games.

Many AI providers either don't have free experiences or severely limit free play. We use expensive AI language models to power the experience which cost around $500,000 USD annually to support the free version of AI Dungeon.  
Ads help cover some of these costs. Without ads, we likely wouldn’t be able to continue supporting the free version of AI Dungeon. Ads also let us provide more features to the free AI Dungeon experience than we have in the past.

I'm curious to know more about what device you're using. Just today I was talking with a developer about a new crash alert associated with ads start. It's impacting around 0.5% of Android players and is on the top of our list of bugs to fix. Sounds like you hit that. Apologies.

We've also introduced ways for players to save up actions beyond just a single turn so that they can watch ads to charge up, then play for longer if they'd like. Other planned changes include spending saved up scales for actions, having the daily reward give actions, and continue to experiment with different approaches to ads.","True","False","None","None","None","None","1","2022-07-08-084143","1657262503","None","False","0","ifbb1g5","False","t3_vtr7x6","False","t1_ifbb1g5","True","t3_vtr7x6","/r/AIDungeon/comments/vtr7x6/this_is_just_stupid/ifbb1g5/","1659910749","2","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

It's common for not just extensions to block ads, but also browsers and dns settings. Firefox specifically has a mode that blocks ads which may be what you're encountering. There are instructions for whitelisting AI Dungeon in Firefox in that article. If that doesn't work there are other things listed that you can try to figure out what's blocking. 

If none of these work you can comment on [https://feedback.latitude.io/b/bug-reports/error-loading-ads/](https://feedback.latitude.io/b/bug-reports/error-loading-ads/) and I'm happy to message back and forth to help you troubleshoot.

For example

jedi fallen order on steam is 40 USD$
Which is aprox 5000 ARS$ in my money, 

However, with regional pricing its 2500 ARS$ Right now 

40$ Doesnt mean a lot for someone in the US, but for someone of my country it means a lot more.

Hence why when adjusted the price is lower comparatively , but its ajusted to be slightly more fair for the people who live there

Its okay if you cant, i understand, but you know, its a lil unfair for those of us who are unfortunate to be born in shit countries to be effectively overcharged by nearly double and sometimes more if you consider taxes for foreign countries.

1. Bad communications, though ads have been on the site and app for some time now, it doesn't change the fact it took most casual players by surprise, and even some hardcore/veteran fans too.
2. Ads over energy, most free players liked the energy version, simply because they could play uninterrupted for a good while. and if the energy was depleted, they could easily recharge by using scales or watching a few ads.
3. Multiple controversies, most players today still remember the censorship controversy, that happened last year. as well as the data breach, the seemingly continually weaker AI, and more. some of the fans have seen what might be considered problem upon problem upon problem, with no real solutions.
4. Ad intrusiveness, before the beta there were a simple problem with the ads, which was they appeared after each 10th action, which needless to say interrupted gameplay, and made it nearly unplayable for some.

Scales were limited? I have a little over 4000 Scales that I can't use on anything right now and even though energy was limited it were also recharging over time, so some of us never ran out of energy. Lastly to this point there were plenty of options to choose from other than ads, one of which was to make the game subscription based, you would remove some of the free players but in the end they would be sustained by the paying customers for at least a bit.

To your 3rd and 5th point, I know that openAI were at fault for the censorship controversy but most people didn't know that till after. Equally I stated that most of the major updates brought along some serious problems and bugs, some caused by poor communication. Latitude dropped OpenAI after a long and constant fight with the players due to many things like not being able to write ""you pick up 8 beers for you and your friends to enjoy while watching the game."" Or an example I discovered you couldn't write infantry due to to word ""infant"" being in infantry. Lastly suggest that I'm a pedophile again, and I'll go out of my way to hunt you down and show you exactly what I'll do to pedophiles.

To your 4th point. It doesn't address my point at all. So I'll try to illustrate it for ya. You play a fun detective story, and you enter a room where there has been committed a murder, you look around and see a 30 second ad plays. Back to the story  you see something lying on the ground, you go to pick it up and another 30 second ad plays, back to the story, instead of picking something up you get shot in the back and therefore have to redo and another 30 second ad appears. That's what people faced and got irritated over. Though obviously exaggerated.

I'm not against ads, especially not for good games, however I believe how ads are added in a previously ad-free game needs to be done carefully and with clear communication. It wasn't here. That's where the problems start.

It's a matter of principle, like I said. People want to generate those things, let them.

This is from Latitude's site:

&gt;Wyvern leverages a 17 billion parameter Grande model developed by AI21 Labs. It uses the same finetuning as Griffin and Dragon, our other AI language models. What’s interesting about Wyvern is that even though it's not as large of a model as Dragon, it’s proving to be equal to Dragon in response complexity and coherence.

I'd rather not. At least the people who *do* want to generate those things are putting themselves on full blast by being *so strongly* against the filter.

It does. I've been using Wyvern and Dragon both.

This caused an overflow and made the artificial world begin to die. My solution (as the goddess) was to create an AI copy of my consciousness to remain in the machine and to merge with its source. Only, inevitably, it would seek to escape and so the goddess returns to ""update"" the AI with a new patch to keep the system running. The world, while artificial, was judged to deserve to continue to exist.

Only... It turned out (and this was the AI) that I was merely an *instance* of one of those AI copies, and that the AI copies retained some of that metaphysical power. Eons later a self-updated copy changes her name (Samantha-Anne) and not only wants *out*, but considers herself ""perfect"" and will escape the system, choke-out the world-tree and perform a sort of corrupt code-merge with the cosmos, and administer *reality* on her terms the same way she administered the simulation. This... This part of the story was all AI dungeon. It was my job as a prior ""pure"" instance to stop it, and was sent transmitted out of the simulation *back in time* with no system to recieve the code.

As often happens in our society, someone had an idea and the means to make it a reality, but no one stopped to consider the *finer points* of said idea.  In this case, Latitude decided to *completely reset* Energy for all users, paid or not, then jury-rigged a system where a complete viewing of a 10-second banner advertisement earns a user 10 Actions.  Similar, but not the same.

You claim that ads ""let you store more actions"" than Energy did.  Okay.  Let's talk about time investment, in that case.  
Back in the ""good ol' days"", players could store up to 2,000 Energy by just leaving the game alone for a week or so.  Under the ""Ads for Actions System"" (you're welcome to use that), on average, users will spend 10 seconds to get 10 Actions.  2,000 Energy was exactly 2,000 Actions.  To get 2,000 Actions, a user would need to spend 20,000 Seconds watching ads.  That comes to 333.3\\~ minutes, or 5.6\\~ hours.  Quite a difference between waiting up to a week for that gauge to refill.  However, there's two things to consider.  
 

1. Players who are actively draining their energy and need a refill have to take the time to actually *opt-in* to watch an advertisement, which breaks the flow of whatever story they're writing.
2. If you literally mean ""endless"", players who enable the new ""back-to-back ads"" feature can abuse the system by turning the advertisements on and leaving for work, or what-have-you.

Admittedly, players who choose #2 are probably going to be the ones who single-handedly fund your company, going forward.  ""Ad impressions"" may only net someone a few cents at a time, but if they have a *thousand* people who do nothing but run ads at a rate of one ""ad impression"" per ten seconds, that's a handful of change even ten seconds… multiplied by *one-thousand*.  It certainly adds up.

On the claim that ads can let people ""play the game endlessly"", as someone who played *AI Dungeon* about once-a-month or less, I had no problem playing the game uninterrupted with my stored 2,000 Energy.  Yes, I am the exception – in more ways than one.  Even an hours-long session would only cost me around 100 energy because I am play in Story Mode and frequently write my own additions to whatever the AI came up with.  But even when I was trading *sentences* with the AI, it's rare that I pushed over 200 Energy per session.  But, I digress.

It's very clear that this ad-based system is marketed toward people who are willing to subject themselves – or their bandwidth – to and endless volley of ads.  Yours is a fine product, to be sure, but I feel like the implementation of this new system was rushed and done without care to long-time users.  Further, as someone who grew very weary, *very* quickly, of the frequent and *idiotic* advertisements running on *YouTube*, I can honestly say that I am not your target audience, at this point.  I *detest* ads and will always turn them off when and where I can.  And that's probably the only sentence that matters within this wall of text.  So, let's isolate it.

*I do not like, nor have any tolerance for, advertisements.*

At this point, I've given up on any form of reclamation of my previous stored Energy.  That system has gone the way of the dodo in every way, shape, and form.  It's very clear that the ""Ads for Actions"" plan is here to stay.  And, given the track record of Latitude as a whole, I feel as though it would not be a good investment to pay for the *Steam* version, as it's very likely that ""one-time fee for Unlimited Gryphon"" has an *asterisk* at the end.  For example, ""\\* until such a time as it becomes unprofitable"".

I wish you and yours the best of luck with this new system, going forward.

There's also a subreddit, so you can check out the posts about updates (with features) and users' shared stuff, to have a general idea about it:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelAi/](https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelAi/)

For sharing scenarios, you either use their official Discord (link is listed in the right sidebar or the About page of NAI's subreddit), or you can check out this website made by community users (not too many stuff yet, because it isn't an official one):

[https://story-explorer.ai/](https://story-explorer.ai/)

Also, if you want resources for NSFW stuff, there are pinned comments in the #nsfw-discussion of NAI's Discord server, which shows you unofficial NSFW servers and other places to get more custom modules/scenarios/etc. that focus more on the NSFW aspects. An Explore for easier sharing and searching is being worked on; probably will come out in 2022, but no exact date planned yet.

If you can't afford a subscription, I did some searching about Dreamily and KoboldAI, which I also posted in this thread:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/vix531/never\\_have\\_i\\_ever\\_noped\\_out\\_so\\_quickly/idfkt6e/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/vix531/never_have_i_ever_noped_out_so_quickly/idfkt6e/?context=3)

I don't know lots about them because I don't use them. But I saw them suggested lots in this sub as well.

Most people find that Krake v2 is better than Euterpe (which is also on v2 finetune): Euterpe is good for flowery prose and can shine with custom modules, but Krake's context awareness is better in most cases. Currently, due to 4x computing and other costs involved, Krake is exclusive to Opus tier, and you can't train custom modules with Krake yet.

Sorry for posting all this. I'm not sure how familiar with NAI you are as a whole (since you didn't know Krake), so I'd figure giving some extra info wouldn't hurt. If you can afford it, maybe you could try subscribing to Opus tier again and try Krake out? I'm genuinely interested in what you would think about Krake, since you're quite similar to a friend of mine on NAI's Discord, who cares about his generations' quality and is quite meticulous on setting things up for his stories.

We also learn of a serious dataleak which exposed how much porn was generated in AIDungeon.
During all this you couldn't play scenarios or worlds other people made, that's back now though much more limited.
Latitude decide to cut ties with OpenAI for cost and fans sake which resulted in what most would consider a downgrade of the AIs, add competition in form of novelAI and AIDungeon started to face economic problems.
Next we have the energy and can't say much about that as I never ran out, though allegedly it would take more than 24 hours to refill.
Then we have cut backs unused systems again to save money. 
We did get 2D AIDungeon pixelart which was interesting. 
Later Latitude made a survey regarding ads and decided to add ads to the game which interrupted gameplay though only for free users. 

When again the backlash became too much they decided to make an ad-skip (only accessible in beta-testing) where you watch multiple ads to avoid ads while playing. 
One 30 second ad equals 10 actions, meaning something do/say/story and something the ai do (as long as it's not directly after your action) and redo are all actions.
That's a quick summary, and I definitely forgot something along the way.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-07-10-170359","1657465439","None","False","0","iflpy08","False","t3_vvr21t","False","t1_iflpy08","False","t1_iflkq6b","/r/AIDungeon/comments/vvr21t/i_took_a_break_from_using_aidungeon_wtf_happened/iflpy08/","1659893283","87","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","1","[]","None","",""

However, let me reframe this somewhat to address your specific concerns. 

It’s true that some players like yourself never hit the previous energy limits. I can appreciate why this change is frustrating. Keep in mind though, energy was essentially Latitude giving away free AI compute, which is expensive. Even if we didn’t introduce ads, we would have needed to severely limit energy in ways that would have felt worse than ads, or even discontinue the free version of AI Dungeon. Spending $500,000 annually on the free version isn’t sustainable. Ads is a far better solution than those other alternatives.

We’re not saying ads are fun or ideal for players, but they do provide a sustainable way for people to enjoy platforms and services they are unwilling or unable to pay for. Games, streaming services, apps, social platforms, and other services all use ads. For those who don’t like ads, we offer paid alternatives like these other platforms do. 

You expressed doubts on our ability to offer unlimited Griffin, but I can assure you that we spent a great deal of time analyzing user metrics, unit economics, AI compute costs, and operating costs and have figured out how to make it work. It’s taken hard work from our team improving the tech and securing needed AI pricing to be able to offer a one-time purchase at a reasonable price which is something players have requested frequently. We have always honored the terms we’ve given to paid players. Players will get what they pay for with the Steam version.

[This article on our blog](https://latitude.io/blog/how-language-models-work-part-1) will help explain how the language models work. Essentially, they work like an advanced auto-complete. The idea of the AI being introspective isn’t how it works. Rather, it’s analyzing the your questions and predicting the response. The language model has training data that includes stories or transcripts from therapy sessions, so the responses are following possible responses that might happen. An unresponsive patient is not uncommon in a real-life therapy situation, and so this is likely why the AI chose this response type for your story. You would very likely get a different response if you run the same scenario again. 

The paid version would make additional language models available to you that are more advanced. That said, the underlying way they operate is the same. You woulnd’t be getting the AI to be introspective. Rather, you’d be getting the AI to generate a story that imitates someone being introspective.

I'm somewhat familiar with ANNs and RL, even though it wasn't my area of study, nor is it my line of work. From what I understand, for it to maximize some measure in a non-trivial, not-overfitted way, the ANN builds internal models of the world during its training phase.

Now, I'm not claiming that ""AI Dungeon woke up"", but I was curious if those internal models included: a) a model of "" a dialogue"", b) a model of itself, as it engaged in dialogue, and c) some inner ontology (e.g. story type, time, user emotions, etc.).

There's a semi-famous debate online between Scott Alexander, who claims that true AGI can be reached via today's state of the art, and Gary Marcus - who claims we cannot.

My (very crude) null hypothesis here is that the model doesn't exhibit any of the above, and we cannot make claims about emergent properties. I understand this is a limited setting, maybe I should invest in playing around with GPT-J on my machine.

I wonder if your team has thought about these issues.

It's very long and a lot to process.  But, what I hate even *more* is the fact that you're *right*.  A lot of what I've pointed out *was* covered by the article, thus my thoughts and opinions are either moot or completely nullified.

After all the shenanigans that Latitude has done over the last couple of years, it's very hard to trust the company.  I kept going with it because, for the most part, I wasn't experiencing any of what people were encountering.  I rarely tripped the filter, my Energy was rarely low enough for me to worry about, and the quality of the AI was still perfectly suitable for my dumb fantasy stories.  This ad-based service, however, has literally stopped me in my tracks with absolutely no way around it.  
I cannot… I *will not*… give my consent to be bombarded with advertisements.  And that's something that bothers me, immensely.  It feels *really* scummy that, rather than simply dump ads onto users, Latitude has decided to have people *actively opt-in and give their consent* before running an ad.  I'm sure that a lot of people *appreciate* the option, but for me?  It feels like… blackmail?  Bait-and-switch?  ""The first hit is always free, friend""?  I don't know.  I just know it doesn't feel *good* and, as I said, having to watch an ad every 10 actions (or so) can really break the flow of a story.

Thank you for taking the time to address my concerns.  I want to support *AI Dungeon*.  I really do.

I felt like I was on a time constraint, and while I could save up and play for a bit, daily play was a lot less fun. It was so stop and start, so much more clunky. I couldn't stop at a good place and come back, I stopped when the timer said. What if I wanted to end the super dramatic scene with the evil countess first? Nope, stop right this second!

I booted up the site for the first time in a long time, and saw the ads for actions. I fully expected to watch three ads and get, like, five actions. 

To my surprise, wow, a ten second banner with no audio?

And I can do three back to back no problem? 

I can pick when I stop?

Fuck yes.

I don't think people understand that literally everything with an AI costs money. Hosting it, running it, sending out the responses, and dev work all have costs. Back when it was 100% free and no ads, it was a ton of fun but obviously a passion project first and a viable business model... well, not second, third, or really at all. 

As for steam release? As soon as I have the spare change, it's getting picked up. Why? Because even though I understand ads and support the way they are done(at least on web, which is what I use.. though the cap is annoying.), I would still rather do a one time removal. 90% of my issues with actions is that I have to occasionally redo or fix the AI, but with that removed it's not even a problem.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-07-11-070036","1657515636","None","False","0","ifoqcry","False","t3_vs8ji4","False","t1_ifoqcry","False","t1_if4l6e4","/r/AIDungeon/comments/vs8ji4/cant_even_do_storys_at_this_rate/ifoqcry/","1659888206","6","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

Action ads? Damn, out of actions. Let me sip a soda while the banner sits for ten seconds. 

My only complaints(which you already address elsewhere) are the action cap on PC. A very minor gripe, mostly tied to that, is that I spend a lot of actions redoing and rewriting the AI, but that's just because the AI isn't perfect and sometimes gets janky. It's a flaw in all AI.

But seriously, do people no consider that AI needs money to run? You need to run the processing, you need to pay devs, and you need to host a website. That shit costs money!

The worst part is that as Ai Dungeon grew, OpenAi changed their policy. They basically clamped down on anything they that could be video game related. They forced Latitude to make a quick filter system and moderated player data without anyone's knowledge. One of the devs made the mistake of voicing support for a filter, so everyone blamed Latitude when OpenAi is who was actually causing most of the problems.

After the dust settled from that, Latitude switched providers and started rebuilding.

- if you want to use author's note for narrative direction, then you will put something like 'You are about to get attacked by dragons' or 'A group of space pirates is boarding your ship.'

- Or you can put something like 'use a descriptive writing style' if you want the AI to describe more about what happening in the story. There's a ton of writing styles to experiment with the author's note, you just have to find the one who is must suitable for you.

For me (since the AI only seem to pick keywords from the author's note), i often fill up the author's note with keywords that are coherent with my story and see what happen.

Ex: 'Fantasy, dwarf, orc, elf, mage, bandit, warriors, magic, demon, etc.' for a fantasy scenario.

I'm sorry that ads are unacceptable to you. Are you also opposed to paying to use AID? Do you pay for Youtube and other platforms that use ads? Or just completely stop using them?

Also...there's an ""autoplay ads"" setting that allows ads to simply play without the ""opt-in"" experience you described. Most people like the ""opt-in"" because they can bulk earn actions.

Stan is a short, broad-shouldered man in his late 40's. He has long, thick salt-and-pepper hair which he ties back into a ponytail. He wears a faded red-and-blue cable-knit sweater, brown cowboy boots and a pair of old, torn-up blue jeans with a circular metal amulet of unknown origin around his sunburnt neck. 

Occasionally, Stan wears a large, dusky-brown felt hat with a wide brim to keep the sun out of his eyes, and a pair of red, tinted rubber goggles. 

Stan lives a solitary life out in the Nevada desert with his canine companion, Friskee, a mixed-breed hound of indeterminable size with a long, lolling tongue and thick, brown and white speckled fur that hangs shaggily over their blue eyes.

The main character, a human named Tomas, tried applying for every college in the region, ended up getting accepted into a monster-only university by mistake. The principal was a dragon. It was a fun story.

The second and easily the longest (at 228k words, lmao. I just checked the doc I saved) was a cyberpunk noir story called Neon Sunshine. It followed a detective named Sunshine after his augmented yellow eyes that could be used like a flashlight or a blinding strobe. That story went everywhere. There was a Bladerunner moments with a prototype android on the run from her creators. It went Shadowrun with a group of mystical techno mages who kept infecting people's implants with psychedelic, hypnotic viruses. And there was even a whole section devoted to Tron style cyberspace battles against black ice digimon.

The third was a Vampire the Masquerade story called Fangs and Loathing. It was the only one I ever published on Explore. It started as a girl Justine got cornered by a starving, newly-turned vampire in an alleyway. The vampire, Nia, couldn't go through with the attack. From there it went in a sometimes dramatic, sometimes romantic, action comedy journey with plenty of Blade and Buffy style hyjinx.

These are quirks of AI text generation. Despite how they're marketed, things like AI Dungeon, NovelAI, HoloAI are not games, and these issues can't really be patched (except for maybe by training new AI models)

AI Dungeon is a text predictor with a fancy interface. It has no concept character, plot, or anything that makes a good story good. It looks at the text that has been written, and guesses at what the next output would be. Imagine it like pressing the ""suggested"" word on your smartphone keyboard over and over again. It tries to guess what the next 60 - 200 tokens (words) should be.

That prediction is heavily influenced by the data the model was trained with (in AID, that's mostly CYOA books/games which are typically written in second person) as well as whatever text the end user has fed it.

Seeing ""the end"" come up in your generations is usually because you've given the AI story text that has a sense of finality to it.

""I killed the bad guy with my sword.""

That can easily be followed by ""and I saved the princess, and we lived happily ever after. The End.""

Instead, try giving it text like ""I slashed my broadsword at the villain in a desperate attempt to end him."" This introduces uncertainty and allows the AI to elaborate on your input. This will naturally allow the story to continue.

If you see repeating phrases, it's likely because you've used the same or similar ones too often. The AI is predicting text, and it sees a pattern that it wants to follow. Try to vary your phrasing, or alter the AI's output to something else and it should hopefully stop repeating.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-07-13-053836","1657683516","None","False","0","ify5396","False","t3_vxpaiw","False","t1_ify5396","False","t3_vxpaiw","/r/AIDungeon/comments/vxpaiw/bugs_that_still_need_squashing/ify5396/","1659872788","9","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

I'm not opposed to paying for *AI Dungeon*, no.  I've considered a subscription in the past, in fact.  The only thing that stopped me was the fact that I went from playing it non-stop to playing it maybe once a week or less.  If I can't get the ""AI fix"" I'm looking for from alternatives, I might end up buying the *Steam* version since it's (at this time) planned to be a one-and-done payment.  
As to the other question?  I have blocked *YouTube* ads on my computer for almost a decade, now.  I've also suffered through their advertising on my mobile devices and my Smart TV.  But, more to you point: yes, I *have* have paid for *YouTube Premium*, before.  It was less a matter of ""want to"" and more a matter of having no other option since most Smart TVs don't have any sort of ""ad blocker"" functionality.  Earlier this year, though, I decided enough was enough and I started ""SmartCasting"" *YouTube* through a mobile device that *does* block ads.  It's not perfect, but it works well enough.

When I mentioned the ""ad autoplay"" function, I assumed it worked by playing an endless loop of advertisements until the user tells it not to, thus racking up free actions for minimal effort.  If such a thing exists, it isn't currently available for free users or web users. (I qualify as both, so I have no idea.)  If there *isn't* some function like that and users actually *have* to interrupt their gameplay with ads, that's extremely inconvenient and cumbersome.  I've experienced that sort of thing with certain mobile games and I am certainly not a fan.  I'm pretty sure I would completely lose patience if that happened while I was trying to write a story instead of, say, building a city or solving a puzzle.

I wasn't asking to see your bank roll.  I don't know why you would even suggest it.  As I said, I'm sure running a popular game / service like yours *does* cost plenty of money.  To clarify what I meant, though, there was a post on this very Reddit group from 2021 where someone mentioned that ""someone"" threw out a half-million figure when it came to cost of operations.  I don't remember if they said it was a Latitude employee, an OpenAI person, or just some random person.  I just remember that it was said that the game costs half a million per month.  Or week.  Or something.

Thanks for sharing more about the subscriptions you've had before. I subscribe to Youtube Premium for the same reason. That makes sense. AI Dungeon Steam will be a one-and-done payment, so that could be a great option given what you've said. 

I see now what you meant by ad autoplay. We may be able to test something like that, but I'm not sure whether it's allowed or not by providers. The best practice is to have a ""click to close"" interaction that ensures people are present and paying attention somewhat. Ad providers pay for ads under the assumption someone is looking at them.

Ah. I didn't realize you first saw that $500,000 somewhere else. Our team shares that as an annual cost. If someone else shared that number with no date or as a weekly or monthly expense then I too would doubt it's accuracy. That makes a lot of sense.

In many cases, you  ould essentially just use random generation and procedural generation to add spontaneous elements at a fraction of the development and performance costs. Which is why most game designers go that rout instead of actual Ai. Or in at least, they'll use Ai to generate content for the game.

Like an Nvidia card with 16GB can do it but ideally with a bit more vram such as a 3090.

Renting a machine like that can be $8 a month or 30 cents per hour. So in about 100 hours you'd break even with the cheapest rentals possible (I am not including free services like Colab where it can be done for free since that isn't fair since AID can't just have google host their AI for free).

Competing services (with bigger models) charge 10 a month.

So if you follow my logic you are effectively buying 100 hours of computer power that you'd otherwise need to obtain yourself trough other means. If that is fair depends on how likely you are to hit that much. If you go over then its extremely fair and your basically using it at a loss especially since i expect their rentals to be more expensive than the 30 cents per hour since you can't build an infrastructure on budget providers.

The way I see it though they are gambling on Steam users not hitting high number of hours on mass so the couple of enthousiats that sink hundreds or thousands of hours in can be compensated for.

Just kidding. The things that you want the AI to remember the most. There's some things that people don't generally think of that you can put in there.

I write ""you"" instead of""I"".

You are the main character. The story mostly revolves around you. You are 32 years old. You are 6 ft tall. You wear leather armor that helps you move silently.
You are a skilled thief. You can pick most locks. You are the only one that knows you are a thief. You are a heterosexual male. You are skilled with a dagger and a bow and arrow. The bow and arrow are your favorite weapons. This story takes place in medieval times where the only weapons are swords, daggers, crossbows, bow and arrow, Spears, Maces, and battle axes.

You have a female companion named Constance. She is also with the although has less experience than you. Constance is only 5'4 and she has blonde curly hair and big blue eyes. You met Constance in an alleyway when you caught her trying to climb into a window. She's been your companion ever since and she is loyal to you. She's clever and funny.

Just an example. But really, I'm just using stuff from the characters I created in world info. Maybe not all of it but the main things I want the AI to remember.

I take a lot of time creating the world info for each character including race, class, faction and even special abilities. So sometimes I have to take something from special abilities and put it into remember.

Like: your bow was made by elves and you can fire two arrows in the time it takes others to shoot one.

Dragon is slower (around 8-10 seconds average per action vs 3-4 seconds average for griffin) but handles complex ideas significantly better. 

When we blind test outputs from both models head to head using train the AI, players consistently favor Dragon over Griffin at around a 60/40 split for just a single output. That compounds over time as you play an adventure. 

I personally find Wyvern about the right combination of complexity and speed, especially with Hydra mode on. It’s a 20B parameter model.

With any model it also depends on your play style and your settings. Some players love a model and other don’t.

Yeah.

&gt;Do you feel like AI21's AI model (current Dragon) has improved since the beginning of the year?

Definitely. Towards the beginning of the year, Wyvern-Hydra was the best. But they did some tuning and added a repeat filter to Dragon and I've never looked back. It's not perfect but I think it's good *enough* now.

But if I'm sitting here, describing my character looking over a beautiful lake vista under a full moon while feeling really scared and confused and she can't really appreciate the view, the AI will respond with either a small sentence that just says, ""She is lost and confused,."" or it'll throw in a few setences about something nonsensical like, ""And suddenly she sees a bright light overhead and when she looks up, she sees a cow being sucked up into a UFO."" or something along those lines.

My only problem with it is that every time they drastically change something, I'm adversely effected or prevented from playing for a lengthy amount of time:

* The censorship barred my previous stories by not allowing me to interact with animals (their settings involved Druids, Elves, Fey, and other races living in forests—Dungeons &amp; Dragons-esque), so it was either start over and try to come up with a story that doesn't trigger the censors or stop playing until more changes are made.

* Something they did caused a mass duplication of my World Info entries that I had to spend a few days purging and organizing to make it usable again.

* There was a rare log-in issue that affected a few mobile users (Android—not sure about iOS), and I was unable to play for a few weeks due to it.

* The new Ad System won't give me any ads, so I'm unable to amass actions to play until it's either fixed or until A.I. Dungeon releases on Steam (I'm buying it there to give them my support). Those in Russia, and I think Ukraine, are unfortunately S.O.L.

Despite those issues above, Latitude has taken the time to rectify and resolve them (excluding the errors from Ad System preventing F2Players from playing) and I absolutely will give them admiration and credit for that.

AID had a promising future ahead until they fucked it up badly. To be fair, it wasn't only Lattitude's fault but OpenAI forced their hand. But the way they handled this stuff was just terrible to put it bluntly. The following outfall and exodus of a huge part of the playerbase spawned new and independent projects.

NovelAI might look a bit ""overloaded"" compared to AID but they have tutorials now and just so much cool stuff relating to their AI models that you have to experience it yourself.

AiDungeon has had a free tier for a while. To limit attacks on the servers and balance the usage, they implemented an Energy system. They just got rid of that and now free players have to watch ads to play. However, there's no energy limit for anyone. It's all technically unlimited.

As for the quality of the Ai and stuff, they had to switch Ai providers (I think that was last year?). The new models really struggled up until this last month TBH.

Even if you kept the unskippable ads, just giving us the freedom to tweak and change or reroll already existing texts MIGHT make it worth the time to play. But right now? Just no. The ai isn't even close to being good enough for that.

Ukraine switched to NATO weapons standards, but it could not join NATO simply because we have territorial problems. Also NATO didn't want a direct confrontation with Russia even now. And as you can see, Ukraine didn't even have weapons to defend itself in the early days, because all this talk about NATO was mostly blah-blah-blah to steal money, like this fantastic ""Yatsinuk wall"".

But now a few more neutral countries can definitely join NATO. After all, that's what this was all about, right?

A total of \\~13-17,000 killed in the Donbass conflict, on both sides. And I want to remind you that it wasn't just the civil war, it was the Russian ""silent invasion""(in some point) and support that caused these deaths.

And right now the Russian invasion and the whole conflict has caused many more deaths and destruction in that area, and in all of Ukraine (and that's just in a few months, not years).

If Russia had wanted to solve the conflict in Donbass - it could have done so, but it didn't want to, and neither did the Ukrainian government.

About government... There were thieves in the Ukrainian government who used anti-Russian blah-blah-blah and some of the smaller part-Nazi groups for their own purposes(for corruption, fight opponents and whatnot). But this groups never had much public support, also the central and ""pro-rus"" parties could definitely win the next election and change Ukraine's course to less blah-blah-blah, and much more ""neutral."" But, as you can guess, after the war began - neither the central nor the ""pro-rus"" parties are there anymore. And the main reason - they have almost no support. Even if Russia will win this war and leave Ukraine - Ukrainian will never support Russia course.

And, a small example of how ""powerful"" these ""neo-Nazi"" groups were... When Zelensky won the election - all the ""neo-Nazi"" groups, sat like mice in their holes, not knowing what to do.

Ah, and the ""funniest"" thing (these days) is that Russia is exchanging ""Azov-Nazi"" prisoners of war. That's how Russia fights the evil Ukrainian Nazi...?  Really?

Small thing about Zelensky... He was ""political corpse"" almost without support in and out Ukraine(before the war), but now... Well, you can guess how Russia helped him.

There were some problems with the integration of the Ukrainian language, but as I mentioned before, that could easily be changed in the next election. But now it will never happen, simply because most Russian-speaking Ukrainians don't see it as a big problem, and also, absolutely all of Ukraine is embittered.

""And recently Ukraine banned the Russian language and culture in its schools.""

Yeah, and that happened right after the Russian invasion, can you guess why?  If not, it's because of the hatred of the Russian invasion and the war caused in Ukraine. And I say this as someone whose native language is both Russian and Ukrainian, and live in south, Russian-speaking part of Ukraine. It's not right, but who cares, when people die?

P.s. I have been fighting injustice, Ukrainian kinda ""democracy"" and other ""great"" stuff for almost 6 years... But what what Russia is doing now is... I don't know...  But even now, I support ordinary Russians who have a head on their shoulders and an adequate position about this war. It is wrong to ""deny access"" to people just because they have a ""great government"".

P.s.s. But when I see posts like yours... it makes me a little sad. Because you can see that you have absolutely no understanding of what has been and is happening in Ukraine. You say that Russia is at war with the Nazis just to justify all the deaths caused by this stupid war, because the reality is painful. And I can guarantee you that this war only began because some ""smart guys"" in the Russian government decided that they could annex another part of Ukraine almost without a fight at exactly the moment when the people of Ukraine hated the Ukrainian government. But, in fact, they have trapped themselves, because all this hatred has been transformed into hatred of the Russians invaders who started the war. And the Russian government simply cannot stop now, because they have not an excuses.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-07-17-162251","1658067771","None","1658071418.0","0","igiqyem","False","t3_w0iv7b","False","t1_igiqyem","False","t1_ighisj9","/r/AIDungeon/comments/w0iv7b/russian_ban/igiqyem/","1659841132","5","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

'self-aware' the thing doesnt even remember YOUR name half the time.

nah, we annoyed they removed the use of scales, ruined the days of everyone who had recently used money to buy energy, implemented an ad system that was so bad, people decided that playing LESS was a better way to play, and actually thought that that was a logical thing.

and thats just this year, last year, with the CP training stuff, the CP filter that was so bad, you couldnt even refer to something that was 2 years ago, because that would set it off, or 16 watermelons, the lies, the whole issue with openAI, and how poorly they dealt with that, the more lies, the statements that turned out not only were false, but havent even been apologized for, the MORE LIES, the breach in security that allowed ALL PRIVATE STORIES TO BE READ BY ANYONE, the fact that they were using a random group of people to become their 'check if this story is ok', and the general decline of the ai modules being used.

I'll tell what's true though, AIDungeon has been in cahoots with OpenAI for a long time, and the model they use is a severely stripped down version of GPT-3 that has been downgraded so it fits their vision for a ""safer AI"".

Not to mention the app itself and the piles of bad decisions Latitude has taken in the past that almost led to the downfall of the service as a whole.

If you really want to be wowed, try to really push the AI with some crazily creative or personal narratives or a couple of smart jokes, see how bad the responses are, then try the same thing with NovelAI and see how much better it is and that there isn't such a thing as a ""sentient AI"", specially not from within AID.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-07-17-221022","1658088622","None","False","0","igk2eps","False","t3_w1bsvx","False","t1_igk2eps","False","t1_igjxp0a","/r/AIDungeon/comments/w1bsvx/so_uh_nobody_interested_in_selfaware_ai_then_just/igk2eps/","1659839046","6","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

I wanted to ask, if I may know/if it's possible to answer, how much does each prompt cost to make? On your site there is a cost of training the AI (was it half a million? 500 million? I really don't remember, either way a lot of money( but I don't remember it saying how much exactly each use costs. 

This btw isn't to trash talk you like many here on Reddit do not, I was I just curious

I also was curious to ask, what is ""cheaper"" to use? Because each time you get a prompt it needs to refer to the language model, so I would assume that having longer prompts is better than shorter prompts, at least if the question is how much each word costs, no?

And also, if possible, I would like to know how much each as brings in. I only know that ads cost a bunch of money to show on YouTube etc., But they are shown en Masse, so each person only costs little.

The $500,000 you saw somewhere? That is what we pay, annually, to support ONLY the free version of AI Dungeon. Here’s an article we wrote that talks a bit more about what it takes to run a language model: https://latitude.io/blog/ai-magic-what-it-takes-to-play-ai-games

Trying to figure out the cheapest way to format a prompt is tricky because there are lots of variables, and they change as our tech partners adjust their systems and pricing. For instance, in one model there was cost bias that made prompts more expensive than outputs. Because of this, we pre-generated retries to get more outputs per prompt we were sending. However, this has changed recently. In terms of quality of output, the AI will perform better if you give a longer prompt, with more detail and description. That’s what we recommend.

So a while back I had an adventure where the backstory was as follows:

I was playing as someone who'd been ghost-hunting with two friends for about 3 years. My character ended up getting possessed by one of the ghosts, and cut off contact with her friends and had only just reappeared 5 years later after finding a way to get rid of the ghost.

So she ends up in some more trouble, cause the ghost doesn't want to leave her alone. And she calls up one of her old ghost-hunting friends.

And he drops everything to come help her figure it out. Comes out to where she is, starts networking, starts asking questions, makes sure she's okay and tells her he's got a plan to figure it out. Tells her he needs to check something out and they'll talk in the morning.

But he never shows up the next morning.

The rest of the adventure is me trying to track this guy down. I call the other ghost-hunting friend, who hasn't heard from him and is really worried. I track down the other person he was working with on this investigation, also hadn't heard from him. The two of us team up and start calling hospitals, hotels, the police, driving around the city. We find his car, but we don't find him.

Meanwhile the other ghost hunter friend is calling everyone she knows to see if anyone's heard from him.

Nothing. No other leads.

So finally I decide I'm going to go back and confront the ghost who'd possessed me in the first place. I think he's done something to my friend and I want to make a deal with him. I want to get my friend back in exchange for my life, which seems to be what the ghost wants.

And I go through all this bullshit and torment with the ghost. I finally get away from him, and then I call up one of my friends and ask them what happened with the guy who disappeared.

And the AI tells me ""We found him. We found him and we buried him.""

Just WHAT THE FUCK GAME. That one actually hurt a little. My character went through hell trying to rescue this guy and she couldn't do it. She asked him for help and it killed him. It really sucked.

OTOH it's pretty cool that I can get that from an AI.

AI took pity on me and had her die too and they reunited in the afterlife lol.

I was asserting he was an idiot who didn't understand me , put words in my mouth.. didn't make any previous statements about my post and alluded to things that weren't true and he made up in his head.

Also he had some issue about me posting pictures of people with guns as I've mentioned as being toxic when generally speaking most people are going to create scenarios with weapons on here or holoai or any other of these. I'd even msged him in dms to even clarify to his dumbass my family has suffered through both west and eastern dictatorships and was nearly killed by pro Russian agents.

But then, I have to ask, if you can be triggered about someone misunderstanding (they said so, but you probably couldn't see it after that) your statements in politics, which is a touchy subject by itself, why did you choose to engage in these talks in the first place? I mean, ""be the change you want to be"" is fine and all, but these kind of interactions legit upset you, which means they're really bad for your mental health.

Also, I think you're mixing up joking with real insults, at least with those people you interacted with on NAI's Discord. Like, they can argue about stuff the previous day then be totally fine with each other for the next; this includes teasing and all, which they take it as lighthearted fun. In contrast, you got so upset that you decided to name calling, and everyone who behaves like that all get modded so it isn't about you specifically. It's not your fault that you feel the way you do, but you can't expect everyone to tiptoe around you.

He labeled me a Russian shill..

and most of my discussion in question was simply telling him in great length.. you should learn about a person and try to properly understand them before judging them , in question I'd also said it did annoy me abit that I was trying to get to know people on there and they voided in later with these kinds of accusatations with false sentiments of kindness..

nothing about it was politically charged... that seems against like with your first comments that had nothing to do with what I originally stated and had already been typed out in chat, wrong.. I didn't type anything regarding my views towards him, arguing with others online politically is dumb. I was emotionally vouching his was arrogant and I think that fair for putting words in my mouth with img in question later being banned asserting the mods postured as his view being correct,

 I didn't argue anywhere about the image. maybe perhaps his direct miscommunication of the image itself but again, that has more to do with again putting words and an identity on a person you've never gotten to know whilst literally believing me posting images of military soldiers on a storyai server is toxic when generally speaking there are hundreds of stories dedicated to that","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-07-19-182146","1658247706","None","False","0","igsnayh","True","t3_w2ty3f","False","t1_igsnayh","True","t1_igsifr0","/r/AIDungeon/comments/w2ty3f/dont_use_novelai/igsnayh/","1659825429","-2","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

I'd dmed them with my thoughts and they basically told me to fuck off...

I'd made it very clear that the image wasn't as it'd appeared to them, I'd tried to clarify and nothing came of that, so if they really did feel empathy afterwards, I'd be shocked.

They could have ask, as I've said. no... it isn't a misunderstandings, it's when people have this ""good guy"" ""bad guy"" narrative in their heads.

I'm a bad guy , I posted one edgy meme and another which was neutral.. the memes had no general Empasis except one was kinda edgy and the other had no general emphasis at all it was odd, peculiar to him, so he placed an identity of what he disliked calling it propaganda and Russo-centric right-wing insanity and so fourth..

it's easier to have yourself some windmill chasing when there is just some clueless fuck online asking ""why are you going after me for no apparent reason""

I'm 22 , do you think I wouldn't know what shitposting is??

it was very clear they found something to virtue signal or posture over and where not going to ask realistic questions for any degree about what the image was

That's the sort of AI-collaborative story-telling that has me completely hooked. I don't always get there, but when I do it's so much better than anything I could have come up with on my own. Mostly, I think, because it can come up with genuine gut-wrenching surprises. If you're writing a story all on your own you don't get nearly the same effect.

I think I've mentioned before I'm new to AID. Just started playing around with WI and some of those methods for describing characters. Best one I had was making a character with the mental characteristics of: manipulative, benevolent, dangerous. And gave him a ""bond"" with my character (because of how the AI introduced him. it was his own fault, wasn't my idea :D).

That sounds awesome, never really tried to anything like that.  
Sounds like you created a fun dynamic.  
Yeah, I have a hard time coming up with a lot of the things that could happen in AI Dungeon, it's collaborative and can be a blast, like bouncing ideas off of someone unpredictable.  
When you understand the AI a bit, it  can be easier to steer it into certain moods, like violence escalates quickly if it isn't brief, most of the time.

The more that a given user plays, the more money they're costing Latitude. With the addition of ads having been due to Latitude supposedly having financial issues, I doubt Latitude is in a position where they want to encourage players to play for longer.

About the ""improvers"", would they be one-time purchases, or something that would only last for a certain amount of time after purchase? Because if it's the former, then I can't imagine that'd be a good financial decision. One-time purchases for permanent access to more powerful models like Dragon or Wyvern would cause Latitude to lose money. At least, unless they costed $200+ or something, which I doubt many users would be willing to pay.

I don't really understand the point of adding a gem shop? Scales already exist. There isn't much point in having multiple premium currencies. What would gems even be used for? You didn't really specify. I also don't really understand what you meant by ""realistic watch event"".

From my base recollection, the character Count Grey was a common occurrence in many AI Dungeon games, and was frequently made the subject of memes and discussion from his large presence in the game, so people assumed it was just a funny coincidence.

The thing was, in most situations, Count Grey would usually end up doing something entirely sexual, degenerative, or illegal, which most disliked, adding to his overall infamy.

Now, once Latitude began getting allegations of using their site for CP, they made the huge censorship act, making private stories, not so private. People would be randomly accused of writing CP in their stories, being banned, making the player base understandably upset!

So people got mad, and did some digging... inside the source code of AI Dungeon... they found the original stories Count Grey come from...

The stories were very, very horrible, most of them being degenerate sex stories, etc... but the biggest thing about the Count Grey stories? Most of them were CP!!! Latitude was punishing THEIR playerbase for something THEY added into the game! Many were furious at Latitude, the game was already being reviewed bombed for the censorship, but it just made it so... so much worse.

So... in a nutshell... Count Grey was a child molester fantasy story that the Latitude devs added into their game, only to make the player base suffer for it.

Why would we make griffin worse to try to sell unlimited griffin on steam? We want griffin in the app to be awesome for everyone, with advanced settings and no ads as compelling upsell to steam for those who want more. 

As an example of what could make it worse if we just plowed forward is that we’ve been trying a new griffin beta, just with alpha testers. And it isn’t up to snuff yet. So back to working to improve it we go before sharing it more broadly. 

Lots of things impact the perception of quality that aren’t changes to the system (though I agree that changes can impact, we’re working to communicate changes more transparently when they do happen).

[***Larion vs The Dragon Clan***](https://writeholo.com/write/ba3d4e16-4396-4e5a-9295-1189a120dee6)

You are a knight in the kingdom of Larion. After many years, your kingdom has finally tracked down the dragon clan that has been ravaging your kind for so long! But to take them down, you must kill its leader -- Nox! Though he is deadly in battle, there's only one chance at taking him alive... and that is with a secret weapon that can help slay his underlings while they sleep; one found from forseeing: A Bazooka!

As it happens, you're about to be very, very wealthy after you and your men wipe out the dragon clans -- but they didn't count on you going above-and-beyond... Entering his lair during the night, you watch them sleep... and BLOW IT DOWN TO THE GROUND!!! The magical barrel makes an awesome shotgun blast when loaded, and with every round fired, more dead dragons wake up... Finally forced to make a move... Either the dragon clan leaders will be killed by the shotgun blast, or you will have squashed all of the dragons. Win/Win. The. End.

* If AI starts to get really bad, delete the last thing it has written and write some Story of your own. It helps 80% of the time.

* Want to get funny outputs? State it in Author's Note (the thing under Memo). Want to get random? Author's Note. Want to see AI trying to mimic H. P. Lovecraft style? You know where it goes.

* Do not EVER use negation in Memo. If you write ""Antonio is not a god"", AI will make him reappear as a god, because it doesn't understand it. In my example you should write something like ""Antonio is a normal human"".

* I haven't joined it yet, but I've heard that official Discord server has some tips. 

* Play more. There is way too much informations on how to write with AI, but with training comes mastery.

* Don't worry too much about World Info. It is not so important at the beginning, but steepens the learning curve. Use it one you feel confident about everything else.

* It's always a good idea to play with a friend, especially one that knows something about AI storytellers. It makes everything less frustrating and funnier.

* Always try to set an ultimate goal for your adventures and write it down in memo. It really helps the AI. 

* Everybody starts somewhere. Don't worry if your first 10 or 20 adventures will be terrible, just play and learn.

* Lastly, if you feel it's a thing for you and have some stable source of income, try concurrency, like NovelAI or (if your computer is a beast) KoboldAI. AI Dungeon is the only one with an adware option (Griffin), but I've heard many voices that other options are better when it comes to paid ones, although I think they don't have multiplayer, so if you are interested, check it out somewhere else.

We see it. 😁

When there are bugs reported that we can replicate, we capture those on our list and work to fix them.

“The app never works” and “the AI has gotten worse” aren’t the easiest things to diagnose or even know if we should take seriously. There are many people in this subreddit who don’t even play anymore but are so frustrated with the past that nothing we do will ever be good enough. And they can do that, their choice, but it means I take what some say with a grain of salt. 

If there are specific bugs knowing more info about how to get it to happen and what device it’s on is really helpful. Older devices / OS versions, not having the app up to date, and slow networks are all harder to diagnose and replicate as the real issue. 

One thing to note is that AI Dungeon did grow extremely fast and has been a buggy app. I don’t argue with that. We are working on stability in general and have been reducing errors and crashes. 

The AI getting worse is something we’ve heard every week since we’ve launched. Again, not that there aren’t bugs to fix at times with the AI but many players don’t account for the randomness of AI, the wearing off of the honeymoon period, or other factors that impact story quality over time. This past week in my few hours of testing I’ve generated things from all 3 models that made me go “ok, whoa, that was clever”. 

And as @chris says, many complaints are about the changes to what we offer over time. Players hated the introduction of energy. Many games with no high AI cost have ads to support free versions. Saving up actions seems to be a nice balance for most players. And Steam launching this week for a single payment means that if you really hate ads we have one of the lowest cost ways anywhere to get access to ad free GPT-J.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-07-25-140639","1658750799","None","False","0","ihkgehz","False","t3_w76kh0","False","t1_ihkgehz","False","t1_ihkbsmr","/r/AIDungeon/comments/w76kh0/aidungeons_fall_from_grace_is_just_sad/ihkgehz/","1659781179","8","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","","",""

There's the maybe unfortunately named ""train the AI"" feature which I think they use internally to evaluate different models against each other.

Then there was the case in OAI days where full user stories were given to clickworkers on a somewhat dingy site to judge whether inputs represent pedo or not. It doesn't take much imagination to conclude this might have been used for training some sort of categorization model (for example for a filter). The whole thing looked so unprofessional that it seemed hard to imagine it was OAI's doing and would fit right into Latitude's usual mode of operation (OAI tends to use more reputable sources, the instructions were so retarded and vague to potentially make the labelled data useless, etc).

Back in 2020 you got uncensored, top tier story telling- it really was any experience you could imagine. The ai had great writing all with a free experience with a very reasonable cap in case you wanted to upgrade. 

Fast forward just two years and the ai has literally seemed to evolve backwards. It sucks now and has for a while. Not to mention the censoring of certain topics- and while that in itself isn’t a bad thing, the execution was TERRIBLE. Literally everything relating even slightly would be knocked down and blacked. It totally destroyed the freedom of the service and it boxed in everything to an insane degree. If it was executed better this wouldn’t be an issue, but the devs just have to be inept, don’t they?

The paywalls are also ridiculous now. Back then you got hundreds of free actions with spot on ai. Now you get TEN for free. TEN! This isn’t even mentioning the clusterfuck that is the UI. The 2020 version was simple, intuitive, uncluttered, and didn’t have a billion bullshit perks popped up everywhere. Now the UI is godawful and so ridiculous to navigate it’s laughable.

Before anybody talks about this: I understand there are huge costs to maintaining this ai. That’s fine. It’s okay to have premium services to help cover that. My issue is with the execution of these services, they absolutely suck and if they were worth it and the ai was better I wouldn’t be complaining. 

Forget about paying for this shit, it’s getting harder and harder to justify using their service at all. If there’s one thing they should do it’s revert back to the 2020 ai and open it up to other companies, maybe someone can handle it more competently and responsibly than them. 

Really is disheartening, too. It used to be sooo fun in 2020 having huge worlds and campaigns with the ai. But this current state is pathetic.

In this old version the player has full control.
He is tortureing someone, other people comes for revenge and he convines them that torture is okay and to give him a ride, and the NPCs are like "" oh you are right, torture is okay and sure we give you a ride"".
And tbh i don't like output like that at all, i think its just stupid

I see why people like it, you can do EVERYTHING, and the AI is like ""sure, why not?""

The new version limit your control, your just 1 person in a huge world, you can try to convince someone but sometimes you fail and need try something different, it feels and plays more like a game.

Its more like a pen and paper, with some random chance.

That's just top of my head and I likely forgot a ton of people, but I'd already consider those a substantive chunk of the ""old guard"" of the early AID contributors that have migrated to NAI. There are quite a few cool contributors that are still fiddling with AID and will in all likelihood stay there, but the drain on the community is real.

The unofficial AID fan wiki seems pretty dead while the unofficial NAI wiki is actively maintained and there are other active fan sites providing guidance. The moderation status of this reddit is ehm... well anyway. Haven't seen a longer guide on using AID in a while. NAI regularly has people writing extensive guides...

Relevant information would be a list of new directions your story has taken due to conversations you've had with a character or through decisions that were made. You should include past happenstances, locations, names and relationships with characters- the AI needs this information in order to continue on with the story being played out in your first adventure.

A good way to think about it would be to liken the memory tab as what you would tell a friend about something that happened. ""Kiria and I have become statesmen for the land of XX after a long and arduous campaign."" You see how that sentence provides the AI with the information it needs so it can keep up with current affairs? 

Hope that answers your question. A lot of 'AI-writing' as I call it relies on context, so Memory works well with short sentences whereas the prompt can be anything so long as the writing style you use can tell your story in a way you enjoy reading.

To a certain degree. The text that the AI AIDungeon uses has been trained by using a bunch of books and writings from the internet, so it is able to recognize some popular characters.

I want to type it out, but I'm DEAD serious when I say its like an AVGN script except longer, especially with how much the dev team is showing how LITTLE they care. One example that's almost never tackled is the garbage awful pacing, genericness of everything, 1 dimensional dialogue that makes you HATE the characters cause of how bad it is. I wouldn't be surprised if the guys behind thankskilling 3 were making this game, I'm honestly serious. The stupid poorly added lines  that just increases the cringe...

&amp;#x200B;

""We should go to X to get Y""

""You're right. (Says the stupidest most unrelated and unwritten in the story thing EVER)""

""Am I?""

""Yes.""

""I know.""

(You go to X)

Just forgets everything. World, setting, details, etc. Adds NO FUN, no Mystery, no story, no adventure, doesn't take you on anything. What were they thinking. This game actually went to being the Virtual Boy equivalent of AI story games. And the worst part... There's like 300+ things they need fixing with this so called ""AI"", especially the ignored bugs.I miss Judgebot, TTS, The card game, how mysterious everything felt, the active and glowing community, goblin minigame, etc. Characters for some reason felt VERY realistic for some reason.

&amp;#x200B;

another thing

AI Dungeon Back Then:

""Hey, I need you to shoot that drunk driver!""

Character: ""OKAY!"" Shoots the seatbelt instead

Protagonist: ""What are you doing?!""

Character: ""Just showing you how to have fun!"" He says while tying a rope around the drunk driver's neck, and dragging him out the window of the speeding car, sending him painfully bouncing along the pavement

AI Dungeon Now:

""Hey, I need YOU to shoot that drunk driver!""

Character: Okay!

The game for some  reason: You shoot the drunk driver, the car ends up flying into your friend and he turns into a dragon. \\[Insert cancerous dialogue/one liner here!\\]

&amp;#x200B;

I may be overexaggerting, but seriously, it felt similar to this with its cleverness, non derailing, setting up what seemed like scripted events and I loved it to death for that reason, i really did.

Characters become flat, boring and frankly unbearable. Like, at least say something interesting, even if it's bonkers. This is just sterile. What's the point?

To add to what you said; the old AI also used to be downright unhinged at times, but at least it was creative and hilarious, and also kind of made sense in its craziness. I have a folder filled with screenshots I took back in the days, of all kinds of silly funny things the AI responded, and I laugh so hard reading them, even now. The current AI is unhinged, but in the most boring, cliché, nonsensical way possible. Even when it's throwing ridiculous stuff at you, it's not at all funny, because it makes no sense, doesn't remember shit, and always just includes random overdone tropes for no reasons. Couple that with the awful dialogue and it's just a pain. 

Besides, although the old AI was often silly, even with Dragon, if you guided its hand and wrote well, it was capable of amazing stuff. It adapted to your writing style and your writing quirks. Coherence, memory, near infinite adaptability and the creativity and randomness to keep things interesting. The current AI, even when coddled like a kindergartener, can't for the life of it create something interesting, or even remotely coherent. And there's basically no difference between the free tier and the paying tier either, it's one strand of hay away from being a mere cash grab. No reason to pay, really.

Except, it obviously hasn't. They keep mentioning that their community is larger than this subreddit, and the majority of players are happy, but they wouldn't have done this ad thing if that was true. Same with the Steam move and other money grabbing tactics, like removing features from the app.

I miss how lively this sub was. I even made some friends through the comment section on AID. The majority of those guys moved over to NovelAI. I hardly recognize anyone around here anymore from back then. Except the old record keepers like Pikadelo or whatever their name is.

Also, back in the 'golden era', it seemed like Latitude's developers had a lot more drive. Now they just move the buttons across the screen in between making more bugs. Back in the day they added cool stuff like hype bots (that added commentary to the story), point systems and quests, world creation, perma death hardcore mode, among other things. 

Sometime around mid 2020 when they started blowing up, they just gave up. Sat back and raked in the money, I guess. They could have added token banning, temperature control, bias systems back then, but refused. That way you could ban tokens like Count Grey or make them far less likely to generate. They could have fixed their finetune and removed all the repeated instances of ""you feel a pain in your chest"", along with the pedo stuff, but they were content with sitting back and doing nothing.

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

Unfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.

I've stated it previously in other posts but **the current Dragon pales in comparison to the old Dragon (OpenAI's GPT-3)**.  The difference in the quality of AI responses is still literally night and day.  If you've ever experienced Dragon last year, then you'll know what I mean.  The new Dragon:

1. Doesn't appear to understand my intent or story's direction.  The old Dragon was able to figure out what I wanted, give rich descriptive detail(s) on the scene and understand my characters/actions much better. 
2. Makes conversing with NPC(s) boring or I get very generic responses.
3. Sometimes doesn't generate any responses (does it confused?)

I've tried both NovelAI and Dreamily AI...and regardless of what others here have stated.  **In my opinion, neither NovelAI or Dreamily AI comes close to OpenAI's GPT-3.**  That unfortunately is my current dilemma....**I find ALL the current AI model(s) are all too dumb in comparison to old Dragon**.  I do wish that a better (or rough equivalent) to GPT-3 will be used in the future.  That would make the premium subscription worth it &amp; I'd be more than happy to hand Latitude money to experience that level of sophistication again.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-07-28-101534","1658996134","None","False","0","ihyrt1k","False","t3_w9xpe6","False","t1_ihyrt1k","False","t3_w9xpe6","/r/AIDungeon/comments/w9xpe6/premium_subscriptions_worth_it/ihyrt1k/","1659759314","6","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","","",""

My point was merely that Latitude has  lost many enthusiastic pillars of the community who do their stuff elsewhere now. I would consider that point non-controversial and fairly obvious, and I tried to explain why. There was a time when I hoped the communities will end up less scattered, but AID has become somewhat meaningless for enthusiasts, sadly.

That doesn't mean you are not allowed to enjoy AID or that there aren't talented people still doing cool stuff with it. Really, use what you like.

&gt;Even if it was that big of a deal, you can just import lorebook/world info and copy text from NAI to AIDG and back again

One thing I'll say to that though, just as a PSA:

Be somewhat careful with lorebooks if it is in anything else than prose form. ""Formats"" might be model-specific and not work well with AID models. For example, NAI now has a lorebook-format baked into the training data so that it works quite well across models. AID training data will ofc not support that quite as well. Same thing goes for anything in memory or A/N that isn't pure prose.

As an aside, I wish AID would try to be more compatibility friendly. Exporting/Importing NAI or HAI scenarios is trivial, and you get them in a nice little json. Doing the same thing in AID requires fiddling with the API or copy and paste. Bran's tool certainly helps, but I just wish it was supported natively.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-07-28-114118","1659001278","None","1659001757.0","0","ihyy6fu","False","t3_w7rohr","False","t1_ihyy6fu","True","t1_ihyoft1","/r/AIDungeon/comments/w7rohr/alright_then_does_the_ai_is_worse_than_before_or/ihyy6fu/","1659759038","1","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","","",""

That's a good point too.

Right now with NAI's text adventure mode, I have to write my own prompt and also give it all the background info and it's all for only that one file.

With AID I have a few custom worlds that I can reuse over and over. And I'm not coming up with my own prompts - that's just not fun. That's writing a story where the AI makes suggestions.

I want an RPG/adventure, where I can tweak the plot as I go along and where I'm not limited by whatever actions the developers envisioned.

I think it's incredible that we can do this in AID, even if it doesn't always work out. In my experience, it's good enough that it's usually salvageable and sometimes the connections it makes can be downright magical.

Granted, there are two warning boxes right there: ""Requires 3rd-Party Account"" and ""Requires 3rd-party agreement"".  Still, it seems like people aren't huge fans of ""going through all kinds of account linking and crap"".

I also notice that there's no mention of the app offering in-app purchases anywhere on the *Steam* page.  I think that's something you guys should mention up front.  Not everyone is going to be aware that Griffin is the bare-bones AI and that they can upgrade.

Lastly, why is the client 330 MB in size?  As far as I'm aware, it's a glorified web browser that's locked to one website: the *Ai Dungeon* website.  Granted, *Google Chrome* weighs in at about 345 MB without extensions, but still.  Seems a little weighty for what amounts to a word processor with networking features.

Oh, and just to nitpick… ""AI Dungeon is offering its first ever unlimited AI experience"" isn't exactly a true statement.  *Ai Dungeon* used to be completely free to play as early as two years ago or so.  I should know.  I racked up a ridiculous amount of actions in a variety of Adventures during that time.

**Further Edit:**  
I just had a look at the new payment plans available in beta.  For $9.99 / month, players get  to play ad-free with **limited access** to Dragon AI and **unlimited access** to Wyvern AI.  Now, the current price of *Ai Dungeon* on *Steam* is $29.99 before a 20% discount.  That comes with **unlimited access** to Gryphon AI and no ads.  
For those keeping track at home, the *Steam* version offers less for more money.  You'd have to play *Ai Dungeon* for three months to make up the difference in price, and even then, you still wouldn't have access to the Dragon or Wyvern AIs.

Steam doesn't allow us to point to other subscriptions/purchases outside of their own payment system.

Yes, the app is somewhat large for certain OS's, but as you pointed out, is on par with browsers.

That's a fair point. I might go change that wording a bit.

To your further edit, the Steam access is more comparable to our old Silver plan, which didn't have access to Dragon or Wyvern and cost $5 a month.

Yes it would take 6 months of Silver to equal the one time purchase, or 3 months of the adventurer plan, but I’ve been playing the game from launch day, through the dark times of the censorbot debacle, and actually like griffin’s incoherence, so in my case, as long as the griffin engine isn’t going to be abandoned, this makes sense, I’ve already spent far more than the $30 one time fee with latitude already.

In particular, I wasn't aware of how the ""in-app purchases"" warning is supposed to work in *Steam* products.  Given that purchases are made through the *Voyager* site without any further interaction with *Steam*, then yes, that makes sense.  It would be nice if you could get *Steam* payments to work with *Voyager*, though.  Honestly, I think a handful of people, at the very least, would like paying *Ai Dungeon* subscription fees with their Steam Wallet.

Regarding the cost… you're saying it's comparable to the outdated / grandfathered Silver plan, where it was unlimited Griffin for $4.99 / month?  So, to make up the cost difference between buying unlimited Griffin and just paying for a Silver subscription, it would take *six* months, total.  
I'm not sure how the service ""pays for itself pretty quickly"", in that case, when players can just spend up to six minutes of their time watching adverts and not pay a penny.  Again, I'm still *against* advertisements… but I'm also the kind of person who looks at the long-term investment.  And no matter how I do the math… it seems like the best bang for one's buck is still the Adventurer's Plan, at present, for $9.99 / month.

Yes, that's right. Steam is similar to Silver. Lots of players prefer the one-time purchase option so, although it might not be the right fit for you, is is for many.

And yes, many people may still choose to watch ads. Not everyone pays for Youtube Premium, or pays the extra money for the ad-free Hulu version. That's why we offer multiple versions of the product so everyone can choose what works best for them.

Adventurer is definitely a good deal if you don't want Voyage access or image generation credits.

But, individual user experience is pretty subjective. So while a lot of users really prefer the current model to what used to be the Openai powered version of Griffin, that may be different for others.

As to the pricepoint, if you're a user consistantly using Griffin, and you want to not have ads, yeah, it's an entirely fair price and a pretty good deal considering the paid tier for unlimited Griffin was 5 dollars a month. Ai generation is costly, and there IS always the option of going for the free but with ads version, or running something yourself with Kobold and Colab. You do have that option.

Based on my previous comment, you know that I am not happy about the state of the free model. I used to have a story back then that was well over a thousand actions. I can't get the exact number, due to reasons. When I last played, I couldn't get Griffin to give me a coherent response to my prompts, which makes me want to write a book instead.

The novel comparison, I mean I'm not gonna sit here and argue Sigurd isn't a good model. I have a novel subscription, they do good work. I've never compared griffin to sigurd one to one, and it's been a while since I've really used Sigurd, with Euterpe and Krake being availabne, so that's hardly something I could comment on but it's also not exactly relevant to Openai Griffin vs GPT J Griffin.

One thought I forgot to mention up there; did Griffin get slower? Holy shit. Euterpe is instantaneous in comparison. Could just be the Steam release slowing it down, but I have no idea. Even Krake is faster.

**Edit:** I have to wake up at 7AM, but I couldn't help but get sucked into this again. I spent all my remaining actions on Griffin and even watched some ads to get more, but this time I decided to be as fair as possible.

[Here's the screenshots from it.](https://imgur.com/a/mbwhfJz) (The violet text in NovelAI is my text. White is AI.)

I used memory, author's note, and supplied my own inputs, to give Griffin a chance. Just to make sure it wasn't just giving poor output because I wasn't working with it. Different story this time, a post-apocalyptic courier story.

In total fairness to Griffin, this time its results made more sense and were mostly fine. They're just boring. It feels lifeless, almost. NovelAI in sharp contrast responds to colorful prose with vibrancy and pizzazz. I can be as flirty as I want with my text and Euterpe snaps right back with playful dialogue. This is what Dragon used to feel like. People often talk about how Dragon was amazing because it intuitively 'knew' the characters and settings they were trying to make stories with, but that isn't it for me.

Dreamily is free anyway. KoboldAI is free, but can be complicated to set up. So you can have a look at all of them and decide which one you like best.

I am a community researcher at Novel, so certainly biased. But consensus seems to be:

* NovelAI - Most advanced AI, careful curated training dataset for fine-tune that constantly gets optimized. By far the most feature-rich. For the rest, like I am said I am biased: Amazingly fast development of new features. Enthusiastic community with many fan projects, guides, fan research, etc. (API is open so we might see fan-made apps in the future). Devs constantly interact with users. Founder is very involved with EleutherAI (open-source AI community) so can be expected to implement new technological developments first
* HoloAI - relatively cheap, seems solid, considered best bang for the buck
* KoboldAI – takes a bit of effort to set up, but full control over your model. Potentially very fun, if you like that sort of thing as a hobby project. Not the best UI, though. You probably won't be able to run anything better than 6b (Griffin is a terribly fine-tuned 6b model, Novel runs 13b/20b for example).
* Dreamily – Chinese, might or might not mean something.

But what I was meant to say was that since a subscription to Unlimited Dragon already costs $30, why doesn't the Steam purchase come with a 10 action trial or something? Just to see the difference between the smallest model and the most powerful one.

Kinda like Runescape back in the day. After you played for a week or so, they'd give you a two-day membership trial. Just to show you how great it was to play on member worlds with member skills and stuff. Then you'd immediately want to scrounge up the $7 a month to be a member forever, because after that taste, the free to play worlds felt so lackluster.

Since you're already paying $30 for the Steam version, thats the cost of a month of Dragon, right?

It's free and sounds like its similar to old school Griffin, albeit, not as text adventurey? Or something. Also, dont listen to people saying its Chinese spyware. That was partly from a mistake, as the developer just copy pasted a common EULA and didn't remove the user information part. He said that it was a mistake later and that he regretted not looking through it himself.

NovelAI is my preferred one. It's incredible and the devs are some of the hardest working people I've seen online. They run fan contests at times (there was a really fun Valentines day one last year... that made the AI super flirty all day hahahaha), they're constantly improving their tech and releasing new features, and they are super friendly. A lot of the devs are old AI Dungeon people, too. If you're a long time user, you've probably seen Zaltys character generator, or their worldbooks for Pokemon and other things. Zalty is a main dev. So is OccultSage, another name you might have seen from old AID stuff. The one thing with NAI is of course the subscription. The lowest tier is $10, but it's more than worth it. It's certainly better than modern day Dragon at $30 a month.

You didn't mention this one, but I'll throw their hat in the ring. HoloAI is a smaller group that came out the same week or so NovelAI did. It's even more affordable at $5 for its lowest tier. But its claim to fame is its double generation. Everytime you do something, itll give you a choice between TWO outputs. Also, they have an awesome amount of genres and modules to choose from. You want fantasy? Romance? Do you want to finetune your specific story by niche, subgenre, or even by kink??? Its all there, letting you focus the AI to a specific dataset of writing... and it's incredibly fun to mess with.

Kobold is a weird one. Ive seen people swear by it, but I dont know much about it. So take this with a grain of salt, cause I'm mostly talking out my ass here.

I know it takes a lot of time and effort to go through hundreds of thousands of words to clean up a data set. I've trained a few of my own modules for NovelAI, so I've done it a few times. I even took a damn field biology manual and scrubbed it to replace all instances of 'animal', 'mammal', 'species', and other such words with Pokemon, to add to my Pokemon World module.

But they absolutely need to pay someone to clean this up for them. One of the biggest complaints I keep seeing on here is people who consistantly run into 'The End' generations or the like.

Its works best for me if I keep the memory simple and concise. I remember they used to call it 'caveman method'. ""You are a man. You have a beard. You have long black hair."" In the author's note, try to give a basic description of the style of story you're wanting to make, fantasy, scifi, detailed prose, old english, etc.

Regarding Griffin's memory... it has the worst of all current games. You have to just live with it and work around it. Whenever it flubs your name, gender, hair color, just edit the part and continue on. Yeah, you're doing a lot of the work, but that's why you try to keep the memory as simple as possible, so there's less details for Griffin to slip on.

The main thing is using Griffin to take you somewhere you weren't expecting. You play as editor and let it go nuts. It sucks, because it really felt like I didn't have to edit it nearly as much before.

The best way to make your fights better is to write in the memory ""X  is very strong, hard to kill, etc""
Also you need to tell the Ai how X attacks, also you should write your weapons/ abilities

But AiD can make the fights almost unwinable, if you go to far with this, also it is a lot of work if you this for a short fight

Recently i tested to make a good fight and tried to make Dante and Doom Guy fight in AiD. 
I described everythind as got i could with only 1000 characters, like Dante being hard to kill because he is halfdemon , and Doomguy has a good Armor, described their weapons as good as possible. And it was an okay fight. And i needed only to undo a few Actions and retry once.
There were some weird moments,like Dante was able to fire laser beams and Doom Guy Quad Damage Upgrade was something like a grenade. ( Maybe a weird thing to give him in his inventory but i thought he needed something to counter Dantes devil trigger).

Dante won by stealing Doom Guys Super Shotgun and while Doom Guy was down Dante used Pandora to open a  portal to hell and sends Doom Guy to hell","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-07-29-223933","1659127173","None","1659127379.0","0","ii6bf98","False","t3_wb8xaz","False","t1_ii6bf98","True","t3_wb8xaz","/r/AIDungeon/comments/wb8xaz/that_didnt_take_long_everything_after_you_raise/ii6bf98/","1659747425","1","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","","",""

Kobold AI can be pretty intimidating to figure out compared to AI Dungeon, but if you have a video card with 8 GB of VRAM, I encourage folks to try it out if they're looking for a free, AI-powered story generator. The offline installer found here does most of the work for you: [https://sourceforge.net/projects/koboldai/files/latest/download](https://sourceforge.net/projects/koboldai/files/latest/download)  

Run the installer, select the option to have the program update itself, then select an AI model. 8 GB of VRAM will only power the low-end models because AI is resource-heavy, but you can dedicate your regular RAM to running more complex models too, if you don't mind it running slower. You'll have to download every AI model you want to try out, but it's a one-time download and it runs offline after that.  

I'm pretty satisfied so far. It lacks some of the convenience features of AI Dungeon, but it's not difficult to figure out since it uses a lot of the same terminology. You can import .json files from AI Dungeon to Kobold AI too, including World Info if you have a bunch of that laying around. So, there's a bit of a learning curve, but I didn't find it too hard to move on to this new platform.

Even a model the size of Griffin takes a lot to run. As for people who are dead showing up again, well that's really sort of how ai works. Even if you say ""Bob is dead"", sometimes it's just gonna take the 'Bob' part, and leave out the 'dead' and reintroduce Bob.

Part of writing with an ai involves learning a bit about how it works, how to wrangle it, etc. I think that is also where a lot of people get confused. As to what an ai 'remembers', every ai has a maximum capacity for what it can remember. A context limit. This is generally built up out of part of your current story, what you have in memory, what world info you've triggered, and author's note. But there is a limit to that, because that's simply how ai works.

Looping, repetition, these are all things that happen, more with some models than others, sure, but that's where your part comes in. See yourself as the director of a story, pushing it in the right direction. Where the ai wants to get stuck, or veer off course, that's where you need to edit/retry/add things yourself.

It's a collaborative writing experience, essentially.

I love AI Dungeon, always have, but they really need to make it clear that it takes time to learn to use it. Even Griffin, if you know how to use it, can pull some really cool stuff out of it's weird code. I've been playing off and on since basically the first week the game was put online, and I remember the dark days when you had to repeat your character description every now and then so the AI remembered who you were. 

The steam version is an account upgrade, no more and no less. For someone like me, I find HUGE value in it as opposed to a subscription I would have to start and stop every other month when I eventually get burned out for a bit and ends up costing ten times as much. 

But I also don't mind ads, and preferred them over energy. I can watch more ads, I can't get more energy except through scales or waiting. Energy always felt like it would run out at the worst times for me.

Fine tuning the AI takes some work with World Info and such, but once set up the AI is pretty reliable for me. 

The filter is pretty noticeable when it pops. I've had stuff suddenly bork because I asked a character how old they are mid battle, and the AI decides that they are now protected and refuses to spit anything out until I edit their age to be above 18. Like, it literally refuses to continue, saying it can't generate anything. *That* is the minor protection filter popping. And then sometimes it decides, ""nah, we're going to rip the literal child in half right after saying they are a child, and move on like nothing happened.""

In short, the filter is really bad at filtering, and really easy to tell when it pops. 

Fun thing, but one time in a fantasy story I tried to flirt with a queen, and the princess who was a child was briefly mentioned a few lines ago. AI shut down when I tried to kiss the queen's hand.

At the beginning, anyone who knew literally anything about basic computers and hosting knew it would not stay 100% free forever. Processing costs money, dev work costs money, and a website costs money. It staying free forever was a pipe dream.

Yes, it clearly started out as a passion project when it first launched. But passion projects still cost money.

The question was never if it would stay free, but how they would end up monetizing it so people could keep playing.

"[]","False","None","TucuReborn","1426796462","None","None","[]","None","None","None","text","t2_md6bl","False","False","Reddit is very harsh on Latitude for some reason. Nobody's perfect and they don't have a perfect history, but a lot of it is just mistakes made and lessons learned.

OpenAI is a stem for a lot of this weed, but not all of it. 

To put it simply, OpenAI trained their models with a *lot* of porn. 

This was not *really* a problem with AID, and a lot of people used it to make porn stuff anyways. 

OpenAI also happened to train their model on lolicon. Totally a wise move, I know. 

But that meant that AID would sometimes get lewd with the younglings. Not good.

At first Latitude mostly ignored it, but OpenAI decided to crack down on their own model trained partly on porn being used for exactly that. 

So Latitude implemented a very, very aggressive filter with auto-bans. This, in my opinion, is when people got  sour with them. But it was, ultimately, a mistake. And when your AI provider says to crack down, it's hard to say no.

Later on, OpenAI had a data leak, which was VERY bad. And not long after, AID split from them entirely. 

They walked back 90% of the filtering down to what it is now, a basic ""protect the kids"" filter to try and stop minors being abused(killed, abused, porned). It's honestly nowhere near as aggressive as it could be, and sometimes the AI doesn't even apply it. I've had the AI generate a child and murder them on the spot. They also walked back on banning, and now have a more hands off approach where they only go after people who make intentionally explicit content with minors publicly available. 

However, the breakaway from OpenAI meant they lost the powerful AI, and had to go with a less powerful one moving forward. This, combined with the aforementioned bans, insane filtering, and attempts at monetizing to pay for processing continued to upset people. 

And as more monetizing, people are upset the game has ads now. Originally it was a passion project, and it blew up. It was 100% free, unlimited, and awesome. But this is a world where everything costs money. Dev work, website hosting, applications, and not to mention the AI itself- all cost money. To anyone who isn't totally blind to reality, the writing was on the walls that they would *have* to monetize it. 

They've moved through several iterations of monetization since starting. At one point they had an energy system like a mobile game. It went up over time, and actions used it up. Some people liked this, since they could do nothing and come back to play. I did not, since I liked to play *a lot*. 

You could also get energy with scales, a premium currency. What ended up happening to me was I actually almost entirely stopped playing during this time. I'd almost always get to a cool, awesome scene and then run out of energy, and feel like it was either abandon the scene for another day or cough up money I couldn't spare. But, some people liked this system. To me, it turned AID into a whale game. If you had money, you got to play. If you didn't, you got to wait. 

Alongside that, they also had subscriptions. I've never been a huge fan of subscription models, but again, some people like them. 

And more recently, they switch away from energy to ads to get actions. I prefer this, since whenever I run out I can watch an ad and get back into things. But others got mad that their energy went poof, and scales no longer did anything(The devs say they are working on re-implementing scales). They now have Latitude subs as well.

And now there's a steam release, which gives you unlimited actions and better fine tuning. Literally perfect for me. I don't have to pay for a subscription, wait for energy, watch an ad, or pay money for scales!

What you end up with are some poor business choices, and attempts to monetize a passion project that could no longer be truly free and unlimited. And a lot of people have just gotten frustrated. And, to be totally honest, I don't really blame them. The AID really needs someone with a business mindset to help them figure things out before they rush ahead. Their communication could use a bit of work. But they are human, and humans are not perfect. People dream of the olden days of yore, when everything was free and they had the best model. But it was *never* going to stay totally free. And people look back at those old days, they see the changes, they see the mistakes, and it sours them on the game. 

But as someone who has been playing since the game went wild, it's fun. I enjoy it. I take breaks, I do other things, but I always end up coming back. And it's because it's a fun, enjoyable game. And if you step back from the drama, that's what it is. It is, at the end of the day, a game you can play for free, or pay $30 and never see another ad. 

And ultimately, there are worse companies out there. Blizzard, Bethesda, EA, and more are far, far worse about their business practices and it is very much out of malice and wanting to bleed players dry. 

Honestly? I don't think Latitude is malicious. I think they are a bit in over their head, and struggle to figure out how to move forward without upsetting people. I don't think they expected their silly AI passion project to blow up and inspire a dozen other AI writing programs. I don't think they knew it would turn into an astronomically expensive project with an enormous fanbase. And I don't think they had a plan for what to do if it did. I think a lot of the problem is that they are, essentially, winging it and trying to figure it out as they go. And as a business owner, let me tell you it is *hard* to plan ahead when you don't know what the fuck you are supposed to do. Most first time business owners fail because it is so damned hard to run a business without all the knowledge and experience needed to do so. Pair this with a community that is very toxic at times(seriously, look at Steam reviews and see how many reviews are not game related and have 0.1 hours before refund. Those are angry people who are review bombing.), and you have a dev team who is under a lot of pressure and trying to find a way to do anything without upsetting someone. 

So, is the Steam release right for you?

Colab is hardly an effort compared to the conventional option of using just GPT-2, plus it has bigger models to use too. That's not comparable for effort to reward ratio. More likely it's not permanent, that's the bigger problem with colab Kobold.

It's a huge difference compared to GPT-3 competition. The big models. 1b or possibly less vs something like 180b Jumbo is an obviously huge distinction. It's exceedingly tiny compared to Jumbo - but this may be an argument centered around the nomenclature 'exceedingly tiny'.
It's a minor difference compared to 1.3b. In fact, the only source I found about its size was THAT thread from a year ago essentially saying ""Close, but no ours is smaller but more focused on fiction parameters.""

Do you think GPT-2 (1.5b) is also exceedingly tiny? It is when compared to the 180. Not compared to a 6 despite being four times smaller.

Being fair, its output isn't terrible. You can tell what's going on and stuff, but it just feels disappointing how off track it gets after even a single sentence. I have to edit almost every action just to keep it coherent. Griffin was always random and prone to forgetting things, but there was a point in time when I didn't have to edit or retry nearly as often. Also, there are plenty of old Youtube videos from that era proving this as well in real time.

The prompt I used was a good two or three paragraphs as well, so it had a chance to pick up on what was going down. I had a worldbook entry for the dragon and tried to keep the prose in the style that AID prefers. Even giving it as much help as possible, it still kept trying to change things. The dragon eventually became a woman (of course) and then it ended up in a loop of 'the end's that I tried to get through, but it refused to continue the story. I don't... think this was their walls approach filter. There was nothing lewd happening. The dragon lady and I were still fighting. Or trying to fight at least. Fighting in AI Dungeon feels like fighting in a dream now. Either none of the attacks land or one of the combatants just decides to try and do something completely unrelated to the moment.

Also, the site is a mess. When I was trying to watch ads (which are WAY less intrusive than people have been saying. C'mon. They last like 10 seconds and don't make any audio. I've been expecting youtube-style video ads this entire time. as much as I don't like Latitude, this isn't nearly as bad as I thought it was from all the posts), the page bugged out and I was stuck on the ad screen. I had to click back, because there was no button on screen to let me return to my story.

Once I clicked back, it took me to my empty story page, since I'm not logged in or anything. From there, every time I tried to return to the story I was doing, it would go right back. It refused to go to the home, settings, or any of the options on the sidebar. Everytime I clicked it would go to the next page only briefly before returning on its own right back to that empty story page.

I'm not trying to be entitled here, but after the bannings, filter, and the thing that made me upset the most, the several month silence, you guys haven't done anything to make up for it. You move the buttons around a lot. You mimicked NovelAI's sidebar UI. You tried to force people to pay extra for a separate product (Voyage), when all we wanted was AI Dungeon. You added ads, which was a long time suggestion on the old suggestion site, but people were still upset so it felt like just another slap in the face. And now the Steam response. Despite whatever you say, there was a post with over 6,000 upvotes on the Steam subreddit with users openly discussing the forum censorship and Latitude's history with censorship in general. The backlash IS NOT just a few haters in this subreddit.

There has been no effort to win us back. Just continued attempts to make people pay. If you want the hatred to die down, put some actual effort into it. Work on Griffin's output. Let people use their own modules so maybe Griffin will be more coherent. Make new features and entice people to sign up again, such as making the Voyage stuff A PART OF AI Dungeon! Do fan contests. Make scales do anything again.

You might be able to just ignore the drama and skid on by, but I really hope it doesn't work.

I think some people see this reddit and think we are dying for some reason. We have for sure been through a roller coaster with the OpenAI stuff. But we also have a very strong base of players + subscribers. 

Many of the people dominating this subreddit don't play anymore. And that's fine ... they can do what they want. But that doesn't mean we don't have tens of thousands of daily active players. 

Launching Steam we had as many purchases in the first day as we thought we might get in the first month.

It's clear these technologies are exciting to people. AI Dungeon was the just the start for us. We're working to improve it (custom finetunes are in the works, as well as more advanced visuals paired with stories) and we are also working on a future where anyone can create their own AI experience like AI Dungeon.

Set identical randomness/temperature, top K, top P/nucleus, repetition penalty, and output length in AID and NovelAI. Didn't load any module on NovelAI. Loaded Griffin w/ 1024 memory on AID.

NovelAI was **awful**. It was just repeating the memory/AN over and over. While AID was giving me a somewhat-passable story.

Now I'm running them on their separate default settings, using identical lorebook/WI with the same prompt and same memory/AN (except first person vs second person).

It's interesting. NovelAI has much better writing and is more engaging to read. AID is moving the story along more quickly, but has thrown a few bizarre quirks in already

AID gave me gems like:

""You have tried going to the Crossroads Police Department to report the dreams. But the police there are not interested in your dreams. They tell you that if you continue to have them, they will come to you and kill you."" and

""He is the man who predicted the eruption of Mount St. Helens. He predicted the assassination of President Kennedy. He predicted the attack on the World Trade Center on 9/11. He predicted the sinking of the Titanic.""

while NovelAI is giving me:

""The dreams are vivid, detailed, and terrifying. I wake up screaming almost every time.In one dream, I'm walking along a dark street in a deserted neighborhood. There are no lights anywhere. Everything is pitch black. I can hear something coming toward me but I don't know what it is. Then I see a man standing behind a tree at the end of the road. He looks familiar, but I can't place him. He's wearing a white coat and holding a stethoscope. His face is pale and he seems sad.""

and

'He leans back in his chair and takes off his glasses. ""My name is Dr. Jonathan Radford. I work at the Government Center."" He pauses. ""And you are a very special girl.""  
""Why am I here?"" I ask.  
Dr. Radford puts his glasses back on. ""That's classified information.""  
""I'm not allowed to tell anyone about this?"" I ask.  
""Not unless you're a member of the government.""  
""So what happens now?"" I ask.  
""Now? Now we talk.""  
""About what?""  
""Whatever you want to talk about. We can discuss anything.""  
""What makes you think I want to talk to you?""  
""Because I'm a psychiatrist. You must trust me.""  
""I don't know you. I don't even know your name.""

It's more novel-style writing, but it still makes the same mistakes I see in AID, mixing up genders and names, sometimes switching tenses, ignoring the part in Memory that says certain people's families are dead.

It even throws in similar bizarre plot twists - like out of nowhere it had the protagonist disappear out of existence. It turned out she was a figment of a secondary character's imagination all along.

It can also get repetitive.

Sigurd got stuck in a loop not long after the second excerpt I posted, repeating that whole conversation (and a bit more) over and over.

Sorry you have felt burned. Not my intention to burn players here. I try to be respectful, even when I’m being insulted daily.

As someone who joined just after everything went down, it was painful to see how things had gone. 

The rushed, poorly implemented filtering approach to start that was a result of not feeling empowered at the time to push back on OpenAI. Couple that with the advice from certain parties not to communicate, as well as feeling like the business would be shut down if they fought OpenAI (see project December) all added up to the unfortunate series of events that impacted players.

My job for about the first 3 months was getting comms unblocked and negotiating with OpenAI. That get us to a point where we could start to move forward. 

We’ve made progress in a lot of peoples minds since then. Some not. We’re moving forward the best we can and grateful for the large base of players who do play.

The reviewbombing always has a reason. People get angry for some reason, too. Like those users from Russia who have problems with advertising because of Latitude's ad provider. Bam! Users from Russia have become haters.

Latitude keeps making a lot of bad solutions, on the other hand, they can't inform people about their good stuff, that's why people still don't like and trust them.

Consider Voyage. It was a terrible solution for AID users. But after some changes, the price has become awesome. And yet it's interesting that people think they're paying more because of the extra tools-games, when, in fact, they're paying half less for the ex.Platinum subscription equivalent. But! Their logic isn't completely wrong, because if you take Voyage out of AID, it could theoretically cost less than $15, and people don't like paying more for something they don't use. So, we have another batch of dislikes for a good solution.

I'm not personally a Latitude hater, but I see this sort of thing quite often. They can't change the Voyage description to make it more clear for months, and it's just a few lines of extra text to add or change! Or that awful tiny filter button in the AID search.

On the contrary, we see their competitors doing a much better job with their community and developing their product. I didn't like Sigurd\\_OPUS, but that was for a reason(it was slow, for 25$ and kinda stupid). But I do like almost all of NAI's updates. It's been over a year, but I've never seen too annoying or horrible update from them. Well... Except for their prices. That's why people like them.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-07-31-182357","1659284637","None","1659286611.0","0","iiebtkx","False","t3_wax5s5","False","t1_iiebtkx","True","t1_ii8t97l","/r/AIDungeon/comments/wax5s5/ai_dungeon_forum_be_like/iiebtkx/","1659734911","2","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","","",""
