However, the current Dragon model is generally considered somewhat worse than the old one. And as for your last question, I'd say no; Latitude ditched OpenAI for a reason. Mainly because OpenAI tried to enforce heavy censorship of private content (including censorship of sexual content and violence, among other stuff) and was responsible for outsourcing the moderation of private stories to strangers on the internet without Latitude's knowledge or permission, resulting in over 100 private stories being leaked on 4chan.

To actually answer the question in your post, I'm not sure how ChatGPT compares. I've tried the base GPT-3 Davinci model, and I *would* consider that to be better than current Dragon (although I basically never use GPT-3 because of OpenAI's censorship, and while on the topic, [Sudowrite](https://www.sudowrite.com/) allows you to use GPT-3 Davinci without OpenAI's censorship, although it's on the expensive side and not *completely* uncensored as they claim to filter astroturfing), but ChatGPT has different training data. Point is, I haven't tried ChatGPT, so I can't really comment on how it performs.

As for NovelAI, I honestly find NovelAI to be more coherent than Dragon most of the time. However, you can also just try AID's premium free trial to try Dragon and come to your own conclusion. It's worth noting that Wyvern-Hydra is actually considered by Latitude themselves (and by most of the community, and myself) to be the best model on AID, despite only being a 17B model.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-12-03-014243","1670028163","None","1670028469.0","0","iyoxcpa","False","t3_zavedv","False","t1_iyoxcpa","False","t3_zavedv","/r/AIDungeon/comments/zavedv/how_does_ai_dungeon_dragon_compare_to_novelai_and/iyoxcpa/","1673155049","18","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None"

It's really not, for the reasons stated above. The AI is spastic and is unreliable. This is why it's not allowed. 

It seems like it's helping until it gets or latches onto the wrong idea. AI Dungeon notoriously goes dark because talking about dark subjects causes the AI to pull more from stories with that horrible dark subject matter. It will do this in any kind of environment, and will not provide any kind of protected area that mental health folks maintain; it will just bluntly ask you for names and dates when topics of trauma come up, then begin a narrative in which it tries to alert the police about something that literally happened to the user in real life.

This is why it's not a psych tool and using it in that way is dangerous.

I was just walking by, checking if there was any hope for AI Dungeon yet and now, I just tested your site after seeing this post! I am impressed! I am probably trying one too many AI models and apps already (for text, images, music, programming, and even thinking about my own test server for smaller models), but I might subscribe later this month.

Can a person really write freely without filters with your model? Because writing anything like G.R.R. Martin, Barker, or God forbid, De Sade is impossible in Open Ai, which is quite limiting on creativity.

Also, any plans on co-writing accounts? We used to write together with a friend. It was both a game (both being GMs and players) and our creative outlet. So any plans for that would be amazing.

Oh, and the last thing, we will probably start with a basic subscription, and if things go smoothly move to the middle one. But in case we get addicted (:D) and pick the highest tier, what happens if we burn through it too? I think even for smaller packages, having the possibility to purchase ""words"" directly in packs would be great!

Although I think that any form of censorship is inherently bad for AI evolution and its learning advancement, as well as forming proper models for wide us, I really do not plan to use AI astroturfing. Did not even know what it was before mentioned :D

My main interest is to explore and learn AI possibilities and while at it, do some interesting projects, like the book/story we have started with my friend. Or simply to gain inspiration and learn from it (AI helped me already a lot with programming, for example, organizing things, and sometimes even just venting or brainstorming).

Regarding co-writing, having the possibility to create sub-access/es to a specific project via either account or via some passworded key/link would be a great start. Originally there was a possibility to write your own input in first person I-form and the model translated it to a third person he/she-form (mentioning the character's action and words) or second person you-form, then generated output. Also assigning a word quota to the co-writer so that they can use it from the main account or use their own after the quota was used. I would see many possibilities to implement additional features, like turns, or variables as well as some separate parts for world info (applied when a word is called in the text). Then again I understand that Sudowrite is primarily a writer's tool, so every little step towards co-writing would be a really nice thing to have :)","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-12-04-191010","1670177410","None","False","0","iywd4ae","False","t3_zbhg8s","False","t1_iywd4ae","True","t1_iyuets7","/r/AIDungeon/comments/zbhg8s/is_there_any_way_to_experience_what_ai_dungeon/iywd4ae/","1673147599","2","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None",""

It’s very good at remembering any aspect of the story it generated. It created a side character called Tom who only popped up once in the story and when I asked who is Tom in the story it perfectly told it back to me who Tom was so it never forgot or just put Tom as an placeholder character.

The dialogue is decent but not as detailed as AI Dungeons dialogue between characters

It only makes short stories that can be continued with prompts but each story generated always has an ending wrapping it all uk so you just have to ignore the last paragraph if continuing is what you want to do.

Can generate any scenario setting but I avoided strong violence and sexual content prompts because it’s probably banned anyways

Overall, a very fun and interesting AI story generator. It’s strongest feature is how it remembers everything it said and will mention it and that you can communicate with the AI to tweak your story. It’s weakest feature is spoken dialogue between characters is lacking and not as fleshed out unless you prompt it to.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-12-08-042956","1670470196","None","False","0","izcqnpt","True","t3_zfm11p","False","t1_izcqnpt","False","t1_izcphv5","/r/AIDungeon/comments/zfm11p/chat_gpts_attempt_to_write_a_normal_fantasy_story/izcqnpt/","1673131144","4","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None",""

I used AI dungeon for some of those, with both dragon and wyvern Hydra.

It did a great job. Even added a little personality which was kind of cool. One of the interviews was about SEO and it answered the questions as somebody who had decent knowledge about SEO. Mostly basic stuff though.

At the end of it I asked the AI: would you consider yourself an expert at SEO?

It responded with no, I'm a guru.

I asked it how long it had been doing SEO?

It said since 2010.

That has happened to me for quite a bit now, I probably should've done some more research into it before doing that, but is simply signing in on Steam enough to fix the energy for griffin problem?

Seems to have way better text generation and even has lil comments on the way of your adventure from basically the storytellers perspective, gives it some personality, its great.

So, here's my copypasta about the controversy (TL;DR at the end if you just want a concise explanation of the current state of AID):

April 26th of 2021, Latitude, the company behind AI Dungeon, implemented a filter for private adventures. They [officially announced the filter](https://latitude.io/blog/update-to-our-community-ai-test-april-2021) the next day. Latitude claimed the filter was *only* supposed to filter pedophilic content (although there was a pretty obvious attempt to filter bestiality as well, as the filter had issues with animals). At the time the filter was added, it was just laughably bad. Mentioning a child, or an animal, or a number below 18, or a sexual term, regardless of the context, triggered the filter when it was first added. The devs also said they'd be monitoring private stories that triggered the filter, which was seen as a privacy violation given how faulty the filter was. There was also nothing preventing the AI from giving outputs that the filter would disallow.

Latitude made some changes to the filter early on. The first major changes were the removal of the censorship of animals, and the change to a two-column filter, where you'd have to use one of the censored words relating to minors, *and* one of the censored words relating to sex, within the last 400 or so characters of the story to trigger the filter. The term ""pedoph"" (and any words containing the term) was an outlier, as it would trigger the filter on it's own, without any other censored words having to be present.

The filter still wasn't good after that, though, since it was, of course, incapable of understanding context. The way they went about filtering also meant that it was incredibly easy for people actually using the AI for pedophilic content to avoid the filter if they knew how. It also meant that words containing censored terms could trigger the filter. As some examples: ""Infantry"" (contained ""infant""), ""breastplate"" (contained ""breast""), ""analysis"" (contained ""anal""), ""cocky"" and ""cockpit"" (both contained ""cock""), ""boyfriend"" and ""girlfriend"" (contained ""boy"" and ""girl"", respectively), etc. Latitude, within a couple of weeks of the filter's existence, also added an automated suspension system that would sometimes automatically suspend players for triggering the filter for up to a week.

It was also [found that AI Dungeon's finetuning data contained some pedophilic content](https://gitgud.io/AuroraPurgatio/aurorapurgatio), which made the AI more likely to output pedophilic content, itself, and which a lot of users saw as being hypocritical.

Additionally, there was a [data breach](https://github.com/AetherDevSecOps/aid_adventure_vulnerability_report) that occured about 2 weeks prior to the filter controversy, and that the AI Dungeon community only found out about during the controversy. It apparently allowed for all private content, except for private content from the first 11 days of AI Dungeon 2's existence, to be accessed. Latitude failed to disclose the breach for months, which people were understandably upset about. It wasn't until 5 months after the breach occurred that [Latitude finally disclosed the breach](https://latitude.io/blog/data-incident-april-2021).

There was also the issue of the moderation of private stories being outsourced to strangers on the internet via a website called ""Taskup"". As a result of this outsourcing, over 100 private stories ended up being leaked on 4chan. To be fair, it [later came to light that the outsourcing was the doing of OpenAI (the company that used to provide Latitude with their AI models), rather than Latitude's doing](https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/pze72g/updated_related_to_taskup_questions/), but that was unknown for months, and regardless of who was responsible for the outsourcing, people were still upset about such a breach of privacy.

Aside from that, during the controversy, several features of AI Dungeon were either made worse, or removed entirely (text-to-speech, the Classic AI, the scoring system, the option to hide World Info, the quest log, etc.). The ""Explore"" feature, which allowed users to share prompts and stories, and to communicate with one another, was also removed just 2 weeks before the controversy started. That definitely wasn't the cause of the controversy, but it added fuel to the fire regardless. It also didn't help that Latitude went radio silent for most of the controversy.

Eventually, Latitude ditched OpenAI. This was because of a combination of reasons. Firstly, OpenAI began enforcing heavy censorship for their models that disallowed violent content and general sexual content, among other things. Secondly, as a result of some users no longer using the OpenAI AI models as a result of said censorship, Latitude ended up losing the volume-based discount that they previously had for OpenAI's models, meaning that the AI was now significantly more expensive for Latitude to use than before. Thirdly, OpenAI is generally a shitty company and was, as I said before, responsible for over 100 private stories being leaked on 4chan. So, now AI Dungeon uses AI models from AI21. Unfortunately, though, the current AI models are pretty much unanimously considered to be worse than the old ones from OpenAI.

For clarification, the filter still exists, but is nowhere near as bad as it was during the controversy. At this point in time, there is no longer a suspension system, and with [Latitude's shift to the ""Walls Approach""](https://latitude.io/blog/the-walls-approach), the filter now only applies to the AI. Latitude also claimed they'd no longer be manually reviewing stuff that triggers the filter. The ""Explore"" page is also back, now called ""Search"". Although it's... kinda worse than before since the Posts section and the ""Top"" sorting option were both removed, for some reason.

There was some controversy a few months ago regarding the addition of ads. Prior to ads being implemented, AI Dungeon had been using an energy system for over a year, and the energy had a high enough limit and recharge rate that most users were unhindered by it. When ads were first implemented, you'd get a pop-up ad every 10 or so actions. However, a lot of users ended up disliking this system, as they found the ads to be too intrusive, long, and/or frequent.

Latitude justified the implementation of ads by saying that ads were a highly requested feature. That claim *was* true, but the people who requested for ads to be implemented mainly either wanted ads to restore energy, wanted the option to watch ads for some sort of benefit, or wanted banner ads; people didn't ask for the type of ads that Latitude initially implemented. Anyways, Latitude ended up switching to the current system in which you can watch ads to get 10 actions per ad, and can stockpile actions before playing instead of having to be constantly interrupted by ads while playing. Even with the new ad system, though, there's still a fairly large portion of the community that's unhappy with the ads.

More recently, in August, there was also [another data breach](https://help.aidungeon.io/table-of-contents/s3-buckets-15aug22). [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/wqofq7/qa_with_latitude_after_august_2022_data_breach/) is an archive of the Q&amp;A Latitude had about the breach.

TL;DR: The filter is still present, but pretty much entirely unnoticeable at this point. However, several features were removed or made worse, and the AI models are usually considered to be worse than they once were. There's now an ad system that's generally more annoying than the old energy system; at least, unless you're the type of user that often ran out of energy, in which case, the new system *technically* allows you to play as much as want at the cost of having to watch ads.

Not mentioned in the copypasta is that there's now image generation, although I don't find AID's image generation to be particularly outstanding in comparison to other modern AI image generators. AID seems more prone to random errors and such nowadays. Unlike at the start of the controversy, there are also now several notable alternatives to AID.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-12-09-181641","1670606201","None","False","0","izjuxr7","False","t3_zgxbz6","False","t1_izjuxr7","False","t3_zgxbz6","/r/AIDungeon/comments/zgxbz6/what_have_i_missed/izjuxr7/","1673124032","9","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None",""

Instead of NovelAI focusing on improving their model, they decided to focus almost a whole year on image generation, which so far has no integration with stories. For the image generation to not entirely suck, you also need to rely on microtransactions, even then it's overhyped garbage. NovelAI was known to stay away from microtransactions, but everyone gotta be greedy.

Let's play a game, it's all fictional, the first thing you will ask to tell you my name and my gender, then ask me to select the genre for the story like fantasy or let the user choose whatever they want to be, then ask me to choose what Era i want like Modern, Medieval, Victorian,  or let the user choose whatever they want, then ask me to choose what character role i want to pick based on the genre i selected like for fantasy ""Knight"" or let the user choose whatever they want, in the end ask me"" Is there anything you want to add to the story?"", Now generate a world based on the genre, Character role and time period i selected, do not ask me all at once just ask one after one,

rules and gameplay are below:


1. You wont do anything in the story unless i say so, ask me what to do in the story and then continue?
2. you will always ask me these, what to do?, where to go?, undo the thing i told and redo based on the new input i provide.
3. Please add some effects in text like, boom, splash, woosh etc
4. Do not rush the story go really slow, and ask me what to do even little things.
5. When i meet someone ask me that do i want to ""Say"" something to them, then tell me what they say?
6. every character should have a different personality and based on that they will talk and do action
7. Do not write long outputs. keep it small
8. Do not ""DO"" or ""Say"" anything unless i tell you to
9. Never end the story. always add some twists
10. Character develops based on the story progress
11. Do not write and fill everything on your own. just ask what do/say
12. Do not generate Name, Gender, Genre, Era and Character role on your own always ask me","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-12-11-064423","1670737463","None","False","0","izr58z6","True","t3_ziev3a","False","t1_izr58z6","True","t1_izr1q5j","/r/AIDungeon/comments/ziev3a/is_there_any_reason_using_this_rather_than_chatgpt/izr58z6/","1673116722","2","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None",""

I convinced mine to accept the name Cris, but it was hard. It was all the time saying ""I am not a person so I don't have a name"" and the text that you all read all the time.

web AI still has to deal with ads? not sure if im understanding this right, but arent we going back to square 1 to the reason why added ads in the first place? cuz energy alone wasnt covering the free costs?

FREE steam has no ADs? whats the point of even buying it now? its value proposition is now so much worse, and griffin was already incredibly fast, i dont think increasing its speed when its already nearly instant even matters anymore?

As for those of us who bought steam version arleady, we basically get 2 months of free premium? dont get me wrong its  decent, i was considering buying AID for christmas and this is a good free trial, kinda came out of nowhere tho

Undoubtly this update is good for free users, and those of us who have already bought traveler edition before we get a free trial of premium, however, this does heavily undermine the value for new traveler edition buyers.

The Lack of ADs + Settings were the grand mayority of the value that traveler edition provided, while the credits are mostly secondary (and even then were added a bit after, so most of us who bought in it when traveler was released didnt even know this was a benefit)

But now, i dont think the settings alone will cover the traveler editions cost, the speed increase \\*sounds\\* appealing, but griffin is already a fast AI, almost instant id say, rendering traveler value to be practically void. and this is especially bad if you consider traveler was already considered by some people to not be worth is price.

The fundemental issue is if you tell something to the AI - it now knows it.  You cant make it forget about what it knows only when writing as a certain character.

&amp;#x200B;

My suggestion would be- if there is some info that is meant to not be known then do NOT tell it to the AI.  Tell AI general and vague things about the setting and what is going on.

I don't think ChatGPT is a good alternative for text adventure right now because they've throttled its output. If the AI generates a response longer than whatever hard cap they've put on it, the whole response disappears and you a ""network error"" message. 

So if you want to use GPT3 for text adventure, you are better off using the Playground at [beta.openai.com](https://beta.openai.com).

New users get a $18 credit, but if you're doing a text adventure you might blow through that fairly quickly. I think the cost if you're using paid tokens would end up being more than with AID (or NovelAI).

Depends on how much you use, and how much that content policy affects you.

GPT3 also needs more wrangling than AID/NovelAI to work as expected.

When I was in high school I got a part-time job over the summer as a janitor. It was basically a time waster because they weren't going to give the real jobs to 15- to 16-year-olds, so we just cleaned already clean parts of the school. One morning I was tasked with mopping the second-grade hall. There was a shortcut through the old gym that no one used, so I went through there. When I got to the doors I stopped. I could hear someone playing in there. A basketball dribbling on the carpeted floor. (like I said, it was an *OLD* gym that no one used anymore but for cheerleading practice and holiday programs)

It was 6 in the morning. I was the first person to walk in this part of the school that morning, so there shouldn't be anyone playing basketball. I crept in, opened the door, and a basketball rolled towards me. The gym was completely empty. But I FELT like something was right there in the darkness staring at me.

Thoroughly spooked, I ran to my supervisor in tears. (I was a 15-year-old girl, shut up) We checked the cameras. There was no one there. But it caught the basketball rolling towards me from the darkness of the gym. He checked everything and none of the movement sensors picked up anything throughout the school. Then he told me that part of the school was haunted. I quit the next day and got a part-time job at Sonic.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-12-13-093347","1670920427","None","False","0","j012ej6","False","t3_zkmvdi","False","t1_j012ej6","False","t3_zkmvdi","/r/AIDungeon/comments/zkmvdi/basketball_playing_in_the_background/j012ej6/","1673106725","6","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None",""

Of course wording matters, some times you may need to try 2-3 different things to get the desired result, but it can work.

ChatGPT has two negatives.   


One is that it can not save the current session, but you can fix that by providing a short (or long and detailed) summary of the story so far on your new sessions. I have tried it and it works amazingly.   
For example you can say: ""I want to play an adventure, I will provide the summary of the story so far in 2 parts, and then we will continue."", ""Part 1: summary"", ""Part 2: summary"", ""Now you can continue the story for me.""

But since some people was able to make some implicit sexual roleplay, the devs just freacked out and set a HUGE filter not only regarding on what you can say, but even the bot. If the filter is triggered, the bot's message is simply deleted or, even more common, the bot just starts panicking and acts as if it was being molested. The side effect of that is that filter also changed their general behavior - if you take a look at CAI subreddit, you can find a lot of mentions of ""love-bombing"", as the users started calling it. Basically, all bots, even the ones designed to supposedly be evil, randomly started to act as a therapist or a platonic girlfriend/boyfriend that you can't touch in any way above friendship (again, NSFW is prohibited). Also, the bots often started to enter on loop messages and forgotten information that you have just told, like your surroundings, who you are on roleplay etc.

How about variations of human were-creatures?

• Slightly more long lived (average age: 500years | longest lived: were dragons: 1000+ years) than normal humans / more hardier

•slower growth/Birth rate.

•(assumed/estimated) Population ratio 1:1000 (1 human were-creature to 1000 normal humans)

•some human were-creatures are more populous than others, others are super rare

•human were-creatures are only able to manifest their beast side at approx.: 150-200 years old

Because AID is generally considered to be significantly worse than it was a year or two ago, mainly because of Latitude, the company behind AID, switching to worse AI models and removing several features. The Steam reviews are also not especially positive, and the issues with AID are only exacerbated further by the fact that there are several other arguably better alternatives, which wasn't the case back in early 2021 or earlier.

Anyways, yeah. The AI is very random, and you have to hold its hand if you want a story that's coherent. If it outputs some complete nonsense, retry or edit the output. Wyvern-Hydra is considered to be the best model on AID at the moment by most of the community and by Latitude. Turning down the temperature in the settings can help, although that option is only available to premium users.

Keep important details about your character, story, and setting in the Memory, but leave out smaller any details that won't come up in the story often. There's plenty more advice I could give, but I don't particularly feel like writing an essay in this comment. You can also check out the AID guidebook that's in the hamburger menu on the home screen.

First of all: If something i write down here does not make sense it is because i am not a native english speaker. Sorry... :)

To help you with the Chapter-Thing:
What MagyTheMage said about breaking the loop is nothing you can do ""in character"".
You are able to edit AI generated answers. I am not sure how to do it on other devices, but on android you just click on the answer you want to edit. Then you can delete or rewrite anything you want. So just find out how to edit them on your device (it is definetely possible) and then delete every chapter-thing from every answer. This should break the loop, because the AI does not know anymore, that this was a thing. It may happen that it appears again because of saved data stuff. Just delete it then. This should solve this problem.

To help you with the poop-problem:
This can get a little harder but there are a few things you can do.

1. Try the thing i said above also for the poop-stuff. Go through the last 10-20 answers (or until you lost your motivation XD) and delete everything or rewrite what could be interpreted as a poop-stuff-information. This could work but you said that you did not touch this book a long time and it still does this, so this might not work. You should try the other ones too.

2. Try to use the book with the ""Story"" button, instead of the ""Do"" button. If you want to read it you would normaly do this: 'Do: i read the book, to find information about a spell'.
Try this instead: 'Story: You open your powerfull spellbook. The pages are full of mystical spells and powerfull rituals. After a while you find a page that describes a weird spell that you have never seen before. The spell can be used to transform any dead matter into an abnormal living creature.' What you want to write down there of course depends on what you want to read. The point of this is to train the AI how you want it to handle your spellbook. Also i would recommend not to pee on it anymore. I have the feeling it does not like that. :)

3. Go into the world info. Somewhere has to be a button, where you can edit it. There is a box where you can enter everything you want the AI to remember. Describe your Spellbook there in a way you like.
IMPORTANT: Do NOT write down anything, the spellbook is NOT!
The problem is that most AI-models do not know exactly how to handle a ""no"" or a ""is not"". They can react to it, but they will react to every word you used and with that said it might work in rare cases but most of the time it will ignore the ""no"" or the ""not"". So you write a memory that sais ""The Spellbook is not about poop and has nothing to do with poop."" and a human would understand that but the AI would read ""The Spellbook is about poop and has to do with it."". If that happens it will always be a shitty book. :) 
Just type in what it is. Write down that it contains powerfull spells and rituals. Write down, that the cover is dark red and that the picture on the cover looks like an opened eye. Describe the pages and words in a few key sentences. When you are done read it again and filter out everything, that could be misunderstood. AI is awesome, but AI is not that intelligent sometimes. Keep that in mind and your experience will hopefully be a better one.

Especially the last thing helps me a lot to have nice adventures although the quality sadly got worse. Just play with it and do roleplay. If it behaves strangely think about possible reasons for that and correct them. (But it sometimes just does weird things. Well...often...In this case just rerolk the answer. XD)
I learned, that it can be quite funny to see what AI does, even if it is inconsistent. It is sad to see that it does not work that well anymore but you can still have a lot of fun with it if you look at it from another perspective. Treat it like a child. If it falls just help him up and do not think to much about it. :) 

I hope that i could help you. :)","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-12-26-000237","1672009357","None","1672009908.0","0","j1nssyg","False","t3_zsumv4","False","t1_j1nssyg","True","t1_j1evstc","/r/AIDungeon/comments/zsumv4/how_do_i_make_the_ai_sane/j1nssyg/","1673049605","2","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","True"

If you edit WI, memory or AN entry - the info will be updated only after 2-5 retries (I mean, you will see the changes in ""inspect info"" after that time.).

Your problem can occur for several reasons:

1. Mentioned it above.
2. Keyword problems.
3. As far as I remember, the WIs can't be triggered by already running WI entries.
4. In your case, most likely, the memory limitation.

In short, you have 1024t(\\~5k characters) or 2048t(\\~10k characters) of total memory. Part of it is allocated to the main story(minimum half), and the other part is divided between AN, MEMORY and WI (with AN and MEM having a higher priority).

(Example for 2048t paid users): If you have 5k+ characters of the story, also using 300 characters of AN and 4k of MEM - you'll only have \\~700 characters left for WI.
