To answer your questions in a word: 
What type of actions? - Mostly on Retry, Continue too but not as consistently for me, Scrolling up messes up too.
How frequently? - If happens once, it'll happen again until I exit the story.
Other clues? - Maybe story length? My shorter stories don't bug, or I haven't seen it yet at least.

Beyond this point it's basically more details and observations I've made. I made it separate in case you only need answers to your specific questions.

I'm not sure if this has something to do with specific actions, because pretty much any action makes the bug happen for me. It seems to happen a lot if the game loads too little entries at first and then thinks I'm scrolling up for more. The first few times are okay-ish, but the more it happens, the more ""old"" text gets loaded it seems.

Take a turn behaves a bit differently, it ""erases"" everything except the 2 or 3 last entries. It sort of ""solves"" the text loading in until the beginning, because the game seems to consider everything prior as non existant. If I erase the few entries left, it even gives me the basic prompt about how to start the story when nothing is written yet.

I can try to seek for more clues, but I've already reported a bug in the past, and the reason it existed was far from what I expected. I'm wondering if it has something to do with the story's length since a few other shorter stories work fine, while my old and long ones bug easily. Might simply be an option too, I've changed some as soon as Phoenix update came out.","False","False","False","None","None","None","None","0","1701401809.0","2023-12-01-043649","1701401809.0","None","0","False","0","kbi26kl","False","None","t3_185lj2o","False","None","None","None","[]","t1_kbi26kl","True","0","t1_kbhftul","/r/AIDungeon/comments/185lj2o/gamebreaking_bug_makes_the_app_scroll_all_the_way/kbi26kl/","None","","[]","1701401827","False","2","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","1701401840","2","[]"

Most of our data was shrareable between Phoenix and Legacy which is why, during most of the beta period, players could move back and forth between them. Worlds was the one section that couldn’t work that way. Originally, we were going to wait to migrate the data until after Legacy retired, but we were getting a LOT of feedback from players that prompted us to move it sooner. At this point, about 95% of players are using Phoenix, so it makes sense to have it working there. Migrating back at this point doesn’t seem like the best option.

It’s fair to be skeptical of data. Personally, when I’m questioning data I look at the incentives people have behind the data. As an extreme example, tobacco companies used to publish data that smoking was good for health. Obviously, for them, that would bolster sales. In our case, if we released a product that the majority of our players hated, it would flop and our business would fold. What’s good for players is good for us. We issued the survey so we could see how players felt about the changes and gauge our progress. If the results had been different, we likely would have delayed the shutting down of Legacy until we were comfortable with the results. Sharing this data isn’t intended to sway anyone’s opinion.

My issue is only with the UI and the removal of worlds which I ended up having to create in scenarios now. Now I am on mobile for reference. My issued with the UI is.

1. My stuff/profile. Now this is just lazy. In order to filter/search for my adventures I have to 1a. Click on profile. 1b. Click on my stuff. 1c. Click on search at the top right. 1d. Now you can finally search and use filters for your adventures scenarios etc.

This would've easily been fixed by just keeping it the old way. Which was having a My Stuff button which takes you straight to 1d. Removing all of the other unnecessary pathways just to be able to search for an adventure when in the Legacy model it was just as simple as 2a. clicking the box on the top left. 2b clicking on my stuff. And that's it.

2. Too clunky. Everything is too big and the addition of pictures to the side of every scenario and adventure does nothing. The old My Stuff tab was a good size, filters worked properly and were easy to use. And the boxes for adventures, scenarios, worlds, trash etc were simple and effective. For reference on mobile you have to swipe left to see trash, whereas in Legacy they all sat neatly in a row.

3. I've noticed this quite a bit now. Whenever you leave an adventure or scenario. It will occasionally take you straight back to the home. Example using 1.

You are in an adventure, you wish to leave the adventure. Instead of being taken to 1d. You are taken to home instead. Requiring you to go through the whole process again of 1a. 1b. 1c. Etc. I also don't like the fact I can't view the adventure, occasionally I go back to old adventures, reading through for ideas or if I liked a story element I would just copy and paste it instead of playing the adventure and scrolling for it.

4. I don't know if this is an AI issue or just the result of the new design but even playing the game feels slower. And I hate the text. Also the edit, revert, take a turn. All those buttons are again too clunky, again noticing a theme.

1. I hear you on this one. I may share this with the team. We combined the My Stuff and Profile because, repeatedly, in user testing players were confused which things belonged in which area. We also got feedback from players that they should be combined, especially since your profile has social significance. That said, I can see how it’s less efficient to get to profile search currently. If I may ask, do you use the profile search every time you play? What we’ve heard from most players is the things they access most is recently played adventures, and those are on the home page. What are you searching for generally?
2. We’ve been iterating on the content card design, and there are more condensed views now in all areas. We’re still working on other versions. We agree it’s not quite right and we’re working on it. For the buttons, we added text labels because players didn’t know what they meant. There’s now a setting in the game screen to disable text labels, making the buttons icons only and condensing the view. We could explore making this a global, app-wide setting as well. 
3. I like the feedback about exiting returning you to your previous location, and not the home page. I’ll share this with the team also. There IS a read view for adventures. You can get to it both from the content card (tap on “…” then “read”, or from the adventure detail page (tap on “…” top right, then Read).
4. We have metrics in place to evaluate speed, and Phoenix is certainly faster now than Legacy. That hasn’t always been the case, so if you haven’t tried Phoenix in a while, you’ll likely see improvements there. For the game-screen buttons, as I mentioned earlier there’s a setting now that you can make those icons only. It’s under the Appearance settings on the game screen.

On the simplicity side, it was confusing to players (new players especially) what the differences were between a world and a scenario. There were more similarities than differences. On top of that, players would often wish features from one would be nice on the other. 

Then, as we started thinking of features we could add to improve them, we realized it wasn't clear which of the two should get the feature. If we added the new features to both, then over time they just become even more similar, making the differences between them even more nuanced. 

It just became clear that they would be better combined, both for the current experience and for future enhancements we're exploring.

The creating worlds version was a straight to the point with what I can do. And even though at a time I didn't know what factions were all about, I still was able to play around with it and have a semi level grasp on it. Not to mention how simple it is to use and not confusing.

But with the scenarios version,everything has changed. Everything. So much so that I was more frustrated then happy. Needless to say,I'm not a fan of the scenario version. At all. Like,I don't even know what ""attribute level "" does. It also feels so unorganized too. Not to mention that the ""create a character"" option anyone would get from worlds has change somewhere else. 

Again, I wouldn't complain as much about the scenario version if it was an option in the settings menu. But it isn't,it's in the place of the world version that's more comfortable to me.

Are their users who enjoy the scenario version? Of course their are. But their are just as many people like myself who enjoy the creating worlds in the world version.

And....when stuff like this happens. It just feels a tad bit dejecting that this happening at all.

Anyways,wanted to get that off my chest.","False","False","False","None","None","None","None","0","1701592935.0","2023-12-03-094215","1701592935.0","None","0","False","0","kbskte7","False","None","t3_18835sk","False","None","None","None","[]","t1_kbskte7","True","0","t1_kbpsvqk","/r/AIDungeon/comments/18835sk/dang/kbskte7/","None","","[]","1701592953","False","1","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","1701592966","1","[]","","",""

And your overall sentiment is understandable. We made some big changes, and it’s forced people to relearn things that had become second nature in Legacy. We knew this would be frustrating, so we tried to minimize the number of changes like this, but some were necessary. 

Yes, there are players who like the new setup. Phoenix in general is preferred over Legacy, but I think on this specific feature there’s been more frustration because the flow changes. Other features were just a UI change, so those are more welcomed.

It was fine yesterday so it just started happening to me today. I did notice that the Memory box got bigger/took up more space on the right and the AI model list is in a different order (I'm using the browser version of AI Dungeon, btw). So I'm guessing the AI Dungeon team is updating the code/site or something. But I do hope it gets fixed soon because...yeah, even as a free user, the responses are super short. And sometimes, they don't always make sense?

Like, I feel like after almost every entry, it expects you to take an action or write a personalized response. Before, when I hit Continue, it'll continue the story more or less coherently and I'd only have to edit it every now and then. But now, if I hit Continue, it'll often give me a reply to something I never said or change the ""subject"" to a totally different plotline unless I write my character's response very definitively.

Now, this is just my guess so I could be wrong...but I'm thinking they might be trying to implement:

1) **Spaces between paragraphs.** Because when I hit Continue, the next response occasionally ends up in a new paragraph, which it has rarely done before. But many times for the AI, new paragraph = new plotline.

2)  **Making the AI talk for your player character less.** Like, with shorter responses, it's less likely to write what your player character says so you have more control over how to respond to things. In fact, there are a few times I hit Continue and it generates absolutely nothing! Almost like it's stuck! But it'll keep going if I write a reply. And then, there are times when I hit Continue and the characters will respond to me as if I responded in a certain way, except I didn't. I was trying to get them to continue their last dialogue because it looked like they had more to say but they end up carrying on the conversation after my imaginary response that the AI didn't even bother to write out. So like you said, yes! The answers are jacked up and giving such a weird stopping point. And it's been struggling to keep the plot/current conversation on track. 

Again, I'm only guessing that's what they might be trying to do. It's possible this is just one big glitch that came out of them updating the code/site and/or it's something they're experimenting with.

But I really do hope it gets fixed soon! I normally love AI Dungeon and I'm maybe one of the few who Phoenix grew on over Legacy (again, as a browser user - I have no idea what the mobile version is like). But it's hard to play a scenario when the story and its conversations can't stay on track as well as it used to! 

If they are trying to put spaces between paragraphs and make the AI talk for your character less, those are all fine perks. But if it's going to give odd responses like this, then I can do without them. Either way, I like to think that the team behind AI Dungeon is working to get it fixed and I'll be looking forward to that! For now, I may need to put it down for a bit until it hopefully gets corrected.

1) I generally oppose the Phoenix UI, but here @latitude_official is specific feedback: The Phoenix character creation screen walks me through character choices one step at a time (i.e. Name is one screen, then Gender is the next screen, etc.). This contrasts with the Legacy character creation process in Worlds: I could see all my choices for gender, race, class, faction, etc. all at the same time.

Latitude, please switch over to a single screen character creation process, like in Legacy. This was important to me, because I could see what constraints the creator of the World had in mind, so I could better plan my character, or choose not to play that World. In Phoenix, since I don't know what classes or races, or whatever, I'll get to choose from, I don't want to commit to playing that scenario at all. Playing any new AI Dungeon World or Scenario is a massive time investment and usually involves a lot of alterations to the original prompts.

.

2) I am playing in a browser on a mobile device. Phoenix is very visually frustrating. When I open an adventure to continue it, the text spacing, size, color, and even font changes rapidly. If I scroll back to reread and edit past paragraphs in the adventure, the fonts, line spacing, and text color keep shifting unexpectedly. That alone is unacceptable, but it's not even the most annoying thing about the text. The most annoying thing is that when I click to edit past paragraphs, all the other paragraphs on the screen become dark. This is deeply infuriating. When I'm editing a sentence, I for sure want to be able to see the sentences that precede it and follow it. This is a central reason why I cannot stand playing Phoenix.

Elsewhere on this subreddit, Latitude has said that using beta might relieve some issues of the new UI. A long-standing issue I've had with Latitude's approach to Beta testing is that A) it's almost impossible to find any info on what suite of features is being tested, and B) one has to agree to have their story data potentially read by devs and others. So in order to potentially make the new UI a tad less unusable in obscure ways, I may have to sacrifice privacy?

.

3) In order to offer feedback or request help, Latitude is requiring me to join Discord or Reddit. That customer service decision is off-putting.

.

4) The basis for Latitude's decision to retire legacy seems insufficient.

According to that second graph, 65% of users responded negatively to the idea of retiring Legacy. That's the majority. Only 5% responded positively. 30% were neutral. So the decision is based on 5%?

Latitude wrote that this whole survey included a thousand responses over two days. That's it? I'm surprised that Latitude thinks that two days is a reasonable amount of time. I didn't log on in that time, so I didn't see or respond to that survey.

What percentage of AID's total user base is 1000? Is a two-day survey a reasonable practice among companies like Latitude for audience feedback about massive decisions?

This of course matters to me. I've been committed since 2020. I've stuck with AI Dungeon through the ups and downs. But right now, the pricing is rising faster than the context memory is increasing, Latitude's decision-making is baffling, and my enjoyment is barely salvageable. So I'm sad to say that I'm on the verge of finally leaving AI Dungeon with the retirement of Legacy.","False","False","False","None","None","None","None","0","1701733452.0","2023-12-05-004412","1701733452.0","None","0","False","0","kc0wa9g","False","None","t3_186bijd","False","None","None","None","[]","t1_kc0wa9g","True","0","t3_186bijd","/r/AIDungeon/comments/186bijd/plans_for_retiring_the_legacy_version_of_ai/kc0wa9g/","None","","[]","1701733467","False","1","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","1701733483","1","[]","","","True"

1. That’s an interesting point. I think many players like the immersive “one step at a time” version, but I can see the merits of more of an overview-type approach where you can see everything at once, and jump back and forth between the different items you’re setting up. I can share that with the team.
2. You may be seeing the results of a really annoying set of bugs that have been plaguing us this week. Some fixes are coming. Agree this has been a big pain, but hasn’t generally been an issue. 

To the point of not knowing what is being tested…agree. We discussed last week that we need to start posting patch notes to Reddit in addition to Discord. We also have a project lined up to improve in-app notifications, which would include a simple way to display changes with different versions. So, agree 100% with your point there, and it’s one we’re aware of and have been working on.

Choosing to play using the Beta version doesn’t mean we read your data. The data privacy is the same as in Production, so no worries there. We do ask players, at times, to turn on the “Improve the AI” setting, which creates anonymous AI logs we can use to diagnose AI issues. In those cases, players can send us a short snippet from their adventure that we can go reference in the logs to see if there are AI issues, but these logs aren’t associated with identifiable player information. And, as always, this is an opt-in setting so if privacy is a concern, you can leave it off. 

3. In addition to Reddit or Discord, we have email support at support@aidungeon.com. Is there another option you were expecting for support? 

4. The first graph shows that 65% prefer Phoenix over Legacy. In the second graph, 85% are either in favor of retiring, or accept it’s necessary. It’s fair to read the majority (80%) as neutral, but given the context of the first, the overall picture is pretty good. 

On the number of responses and days, we waited until it was statistically significant. After the first several hundred responses came in, the percentages of players responding in each category stabilized and didn’t change. It’s our experience that, generally, once this happens, we have a representative sample of player sentiment. 

I wouldn’t say we’re relying exclusively on the results of this survey to gauge readiness to retire Legacy. We’ve also been looking at feedback through Reddit, Discord, support email, user interviews, user testing, engagement metrics, revenue data, and more to see what the impact has been. We’ve been gathering feedback about Phoenix for months, and this survey mirrors what we’ve been seeing generally across the board. 

Not sure what you mean about the pricing changes? Those have been the same for quite a while now. We haven’t increased prices. Can you help me understand where you’re seeing a price increase? 

If you do decide to leave, we’ll be sad to see you go. I hope a player like you with thoughtful feedback will see we’re doing our best to listen to player feedback and improve. Already, with Phoenix, we’ve added dozens of changes and improvements that players have asked for. And we’re always looking for more input.

1) Edits being a pop up that obscures everything surrounding what you're editing is actually awful. Genuinely who thought this was a good idea?

2) Home page and Discovery (especially in tile view) are resource hogs. I've checked how much resources it was using on a Chrome tab once and Discovery had 1 GB of memory at one point. Not sure if that's still the case but Tile View in discovery is still horrendously resource intensive

3) No page system for Discovery. This means if you click on something you found in Discovery, then hit the back button to go back to the search.....it sends you right back to the top of the results :V

4) No scrollbar for Discovery....Genuinely why? This just makes it harder to go back to something that interested you. Search settings also can't be accessed after you scroll so it'd take longer to get back to search settings.

5) Inspect Input being tucked away behind the ""Testing & Feedback"" menu that is itself in the Gameplay menu. Should be it's own button next to Erase

6) Making GPT energy invisible if you aren't viewing the Story Generator menu

7) Stable Diffusion is itself locked behind subscription access now despite costing credits

3. Yeah, we have looking at the back button on our list of things.
4. We’re not completely sure because this is typically an OS/Browser setting, but it’s clearly not working as expected. A fix wasn’t quickly found, so we think it might be a deeper issue, possibly related to the front end framework we’re using and we haven’t dug into that further yet, but it’s also on our list.
5. We’ve heard that setting should be moved from others as well. We’re thinking it should probably go by memory/authors note since it’s related to those features. I need to check but it might already be moved in the next version?
6. Not sure what you mean here? Do you mean when you’re making story cards? Or from the game screen?
7. That’s always been the case, but we have some model changes coming that will likely mean we make it available to free players
8. What do you mean by update? Like auto save? So you’re saying that when you type or delete quickly, you see performance issues? How do those manifest? Lag in the type changing or something else?

Windows 10

Before, you could see your GPT energy as part of the game screens UI, which is no longer the case. You can only see it when viewing the models, so if you're on the tab that lets you see Memory and Author's Note you won't be able to see how many uses of ChatGPT you have left. I haven't checked if they're visible on Story Cards as I usually manually create all my Story Cards

> 8. What do you mean by update? Like auto save? So you’re saying that when you type or delete quickly, you see performance issues? How do those manifest? Lag in the type changing or something else?

I likely mean the auto save, just used ""update"" in place of it since the auto save indicator doesn't show up anymore. It's most easily noticed if you hold a key or backspace. Things end up getting deleted in chunks instead of at a consistent rate. Since tags don't get auto-saved until they actually get added, they aren't effected. This can actually cause issues if you type fast enough, as I learned the hard way during the beta. If someone ends up typing faster than it updates, it can end up causing key inputs to get ignored.","False","False","False","None","None","None","None","0","1701758000.0","2023-12-05-073320","1701758000.0","None","0","False","0","kc2dkpw","False","None","t3_18ayxr8","False","None","None","None","[]","t1_kc2dkpw","True","0","t1_kc22676","/r/AIDungeon/comments/18ayxr8/phoenix_update/kc2dkpw/","None","","[]","1701758015","False","2","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","1701758032","2","[]","","","True"

We haven’t had a lot of feedback on this latest design yet so appreciate you sharing with us. I think we probably need to do another pass on that.

I used Griffin 2.1. on the browser. It seems more or less back to what it used to be, which is awesome. The only two things that might need some tweaking are:

1) Sometimes, when I hit Continue, it shows *nothing*. If I refresh the page, it will then show the output (and if you hit Continue multiple times while it was showing nothing before....well! Expect to see multiple outputs in a row). Not sure why it's doing that. To be fair, this occasionally happened even before the update to fix scrolling issues but it's doing it more often now.

2) Sometimes, when I hit the Retry button, I get...pretty much the same identical thing back. Again, that was a thing that happened occasionally before the scrolling update but it's happening more often now.

First and foremost, thank you for your thoughtful response. It matters to me! I've seen this good kind of response from Latitude through the years, and I believe your, and Latitude's, intentionality. In the past I've emailed support@aidungeon.com and received swift, helpful, and non-judgmental responses.

For what it's worth, when I go to the support section of the menu, the ""why isn't the app working"" info doesn't mention the email, and says this: ""If the issue persists, please check our Discord to see if other users are experiencing the same problem. If you don’t see anything, then post to the bugs-feature-request channel with details about the issue."" I can think of many reasons why Latitude would invite crowdsourcing for bugs and support. Latitude used to have a separate site where one could describe a bug and also request features. I thought I had it bookmarked but can't find it anymore. I've used that multiple times in the past. 

About Beta testing, thank you for agreeing! Over a year ago I reported a bug on that site, a bug that I saw many others complaining about too (it severely altered how scrolling worked). The response from Latitude was that it wasn't a bug but a Beta feature being tested. I was very... let's say surprised... that Latitude preferred rolling out a UI feature within the Beta package that players thought was unintentional, in order to see if it bothered people enough to complain, rather than offering the info up in advance so that players could make an informed response to the Beta testing. That explicit choice to invite complaint rather than offer information baffled me. So I never opted in to Beta features again. If I turn on ""improve the AI"" now, the warning notification led me to believe that story data might be shared ""with AI providers,"" and does not specify that I will subsequently have the chance to approve of sharing story data on a case-by-case basis.

But I'll try it out and see what happens.

As I mentioned, I invest a lot of effort into editing the scenarios / worlds I play in order to make them work well enough. You wrote that the Phoenix UI and editing problems are ""generally not an issue,"" and yet for me they are paramount. A key feature of AID that places it above every other AI ""writing assistant"" I've tried is that I can go back in any AID adventure and edit anything, whether it was my input or the AI's response. If I can't do that well, which is currently the case in Phoenix, then I must reconsider cost and ask whether to pay for AID or use ChatGPT for free.","False","False","False","None","None","None","None","0","1701834730.0","2023-12-06-045210","1701834730.0","None","0","False","0","kc6ns6r","False","None","t3_186bijd","False","None","None","None","[]","t1_kc6ns6r","True","0","t1_kc1bgkp","/r/AIDungeon/comments/186bijd/plans_for_retiring_the_legacy_version_of_ai/kc6ns6r/","None","","[]","1701834744","False","1","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","1701834761","1","[]","","","True"

You’re right, we used to have a dedicated bugs/feedback website. It became a beast to manage, and we found that we were getting much better reporting from Reddit and Discord anyway, which is where we spent more of our time. Plus, after a report, it was easier to start a conversation and get more details. Other players could share if they have the same issue. In short, it’s our preferred way to discuss bugs and feedback with players now. We direct people to the support email if they’d rather not join either platform, but that’s the reason for the change. Using these social platforms is a far more interactive and collaborative way to get feedback.

In terms of beta testing, we’re trying to better communicate what is being tested. We’ve been posting the patch notes in Discord, and we plan to post them here. It really wasn’t an intentional decision to NOT share what we’re testing. We’ve always had a small team, and we’ve been getting better and better at adding things like this to our process. That’s why we are planning to add those patch notes to Reddit as well. We’re planning to organize posts like that to make them easier to find here. So, that feature you were testing…we’re not intentionally doing things we think will annoy users. I think in our current process, we’d send features like that our Alpha testers first for feedback, rather than putting in front of our entire Beta audience. At this point, by the time things are in Beta, we’ve already had features vetted by a bunch of players. And we’re also better at sharing what we’re testing. The next step is implementing those testing notes into the product itself, and that is something on our roadmap.

For the “Improve the AI”, it’s completely optional. You’re right, the warning share’s all the ways we COULD use that data, but so far we really only use it for diagnosing AI issues. It is possible, at some point, we could use that data for other things. For instance, a while back we used samples of the anonymized AI logs to contribute to an open source research project advancing AI. So, if players are uncomfortable with that, they should leave that setting off. 

> Yet for me they are paramount

I hear you. And I certainly don’t mean my comment about it being “generally not an issue” to be dismissive of anyone’s experience or feedback. Our challenge as a dev team is to collect all the feedback and figure out what the right path forward is. In many instances, we can’t please everyone, since different players want different things. It’s not always an easy balance. But, we want to hear from as many players as possible so we can make the product great for as many as we can.

Hope that response helps clarify some of those points.

I think the scrolling bug might be there still, but it behaves a bit differently for me. Instead of scrolling as soon as I open a story, it only happens when I scroll up myself. Then, it scrolls up a lot (I'm not waiting on a 6k actions story to see if the beginning shows up before my phone burns.).

All cutoffs are marked in red.

***Most important thing I should note is that I'm using the Steam version.***

I also opened up my longest existing adventure to test and yes, that one is also cut off. Cutoff here is at roughly 5800 words out of 11200. A lot more was preserved in this adventure compared to the original cutoff for the shorter one.

The cutoff is is definitely happening between 'actions' instead of between words, as it's mid-sentence in the shorter adventure and between full sentences in the long one.

***Uhhh total bug reports:***

1. Sometimes when loading into a new adventure, all text is temporarily invisible. Doesn't always happen, but always fixes itself when I open/close the settings sidebar. Probably caused by having left the sidebar open on the last adventure you were playing, causing it to be open when you enter another one.

2. Clicking/opening the edit menu on an existing action while a new one is generating dims all text AND makes the take turn/continue/retry/undo buttons invisible but still interactive. The dimming/invisibility is SOMETIMES fixed by opening/closing the sidebar, but sometimes you have to quit the adventure and reopen it.

This also SEEMS (from my limited testing) to cause the original no generation issue, which unfortunately is semi-permanent. Restarting the app didn't seem to help, but once I opened it in Legacy and then reopened it in Steam, it was fine again.

3. BONUS BUG: Accidentally created a scenario while on the Discover page while I was generating a new adventure to test the original bug on. Canceled out of that and when I hit yes to the trash notification... the L on the PLAY button changed colour? The L, and ONLY the L.

I've been testing random things out, trying to see if I can replicate the bug on purpose. So, during a 1 hour session, I can get the bug to trigger maybe 2-3 times. I am indeed using purely the Story function (i.e. clicking on the text and editing my response in before hitting Continue).

So Continue is pretty much the only button I'm using. I rarely use Retry and I use Erase even less since I can just edit the story myself if I want to fix it.

Now, so far, the bug does not trigger as long as I type or edit something into the field and it's the last thing there. But if I don't write anything into the field and just click Continue, then on the second Continue, it gets stuck. Then I will refresh the page and then it'll work okay if I hit Continue (uh, 90% of the time, at least). And then for a while, even if I keep hitting Continue, it won't run into any trouble...until maybe 10 minutes later or so?

I can't quite figure out what's a consistent trigger for the bug. If I had to describe it...it's like the AI gets writer's block more easily than before. So if I put in Memory something like ""\\[You are in the woods.\\]"" and then my character starts trying to walk out of said woods, it gets its brain short-circuited and can't figure out how to process the fact you're no longer in the woods despite Memory saying so until you hit Refresh.

If I don't have anything particular in Memory that the story is contradicting, then it's like, when the ""scene"" ends, it gets stuck figuring out how to go from Scene A (i.e. you are finishing up an argument with a character) to Scene B (i.e. what happens after you are done arguing). But refreshing the page will usually work to get it out of this weird hump. Or, if it's being really stubborn, writing something in to prompt it on where to go, even though it used to be able to figure out what to do before.

In a similar line, it'll get stuck if, when a character's talking, the output happened to end without a quotation mark. So I hit Continue and expect the character to keep talking (or have the scene continue in another way if not), but there's a chance it will get ""stumped"" and freeze. But if the conversation happens to have a very clear and easy subject/plotline, it'll usually be okay. So it acts like it struggles when things are a little more ""complicated"" and will need a Refresh during those times.

Hope that helped!

I completely appreciate the limitations on capacity, and hope Latitude and its employees are able to avoid overworking! (I'd rather not play any game at the expense of anyone's well being, where I can avoid it.)

About the graphs: I'm not trying to be pedantic, but trying to read them right. The first graph ""which version of AI Dungeon do you prefer"" does indeed show that 65% of 1416 responses selected Phoenix (946 players), and 35% selected Legacy (489 players). Of course there's no way from these two options to know the strength of people's preference.

But in the second graph, ""how will you feel when legacy retires,"" 5% (70 players) responded positively to that. 31% are neutral (439 responses selected ""whatever""). The rest of the responses (64%, 906 players) were negative: either ""sad"" (49%, 694 players) or ""will stop playing"" AID (15%, 212 players).

That second graph is what I was referring to. I read the responses that selected ""sad"" as NOT neutral, but in fact as negative. And of course 212 players explicitly said they'd leave AID when legacy retires, three times as many as selected ""yay."" If additional input stops being statistically significant, then it is already clear that getting rid of Legacy entails a real risk.

Meanwhile I'm trying out Phoenix with ""improve the AI"" switched on. The text editing experience is the same so far (including that the sounding lines become invisible when I try to edit anything). I've also discovered that I cannot copy and paste anything from memory or world info.

I appreciate you being empathetic to our team's challenges. We want to do right by players, and we have some tricky circumstances we're working within. 

I think that's a perfectly reasonable way to read those two graphs. If we were to run the survey again (and maybe we should) we could likely try wording it differently or have additional questions to get a better sense of the strength of preference. Our neutral interpretation was likely influenced by other feedback sources we see, for better or worse. I can't remember if I already shared what I mean by that in this thread, but I'm referring to qualitative feedback from support emails, Discord, Reddit, and user testing. Then we also have other quantitative metrics like play data, retention data, and revenue. We aren't putting absolute trust in any one of the feedback sources, but looking at the overall picture.

Ultimately, though, the underlying question you (and others) are asking is whether this is the right time to retire Legacy. One of the considerations (and probably the most important one) for answering that question is what players want. Our sense is players want things like new models, model improvements, RPG features like inventory, character creator tools, etc. The UI preference between Legacy and Phoenix matters, but it's dropped significantly in priority as we've incorporated feedback into Phoenix. I think it would be fair to say we're taking a more aggressive timeline for when we are retiring Legacy, but doing so accelerates how quickly we can work on those other requests. Model improvements are first on the list. Perhaps an interesting question we could ask in a survey is, ""Would you be in favor of having Legacy stick around for another month if it meant delaying AI improvements by a month?"" I'd be fascinated to see what the response to that would be. I have a stong sense from our other feedback sources, but it would be interesting to see some survey data on that.

\\- There is no scroll bar to show up on the far right to tell you how far you are looking down on the page, or ease of moving up/down without having to use mouse scroll.

With the Phoenix update, you can choose the scenario type and enable character creation. That automatically includes a name and gender. It gives you standard categories for race, class, and faction, but these are optional. If you don't add entries for them, they'll be skipped.

You can also add custom categories that link to any story card you want. I use them for things like starting equipment and starting missions.

>2. How can I make that when the user writes their name/age/gender/X, their card automatically updates? For example, if they say that the name is 'Daniel', the card I have for them says 'Daniel is a student from...'? I want to connect the prompt to their card.

A script could probably do this, though I've never tried it. I usually just type my character's info into Memory. A script could probably do that automatically too. I'd avoid adding player info to Story Cards. They are harder to change and need to be triggered.

So couple of comparisons, Griffin 6B should be very similar to the open source clone of it called Adventure 6B. Those used the same architecture and possibly even the same dataset since AI Dungeon's original dataset was public for anyone to use. So back then it was questionable which one was better. Then Skein 6B came out, and it was a dataset that contained 3 times the adventure data compared to the original AI Dungeon dataset. But it was also mixed in with light novels for an even deeper understanding. That one should have beaten Griffin at the time. Eventually we released a 20B version of that which was aimed to compete with Wyvern.

But thats all old stuff, these days 7B Llama2 models perform similarly to 20B models did back then, so imagine the performance of Wyvern crammed into a 7B. But it gets better, Tiefighter is a 13B so its also twice the size of Griffin. But it gets even better, not only is that expanded adventure dataset in there. There is a LOT in there. From multiple stories it can draw inspiration from, chatbot knowledge, instruction knowledge, etc.

So want to write stories on demand? It can. Want to use it as a chatbot? It can. But most importantly want to use it as AI Dungeon? It absolutely can and I don't think AI Dungeon's dataset compares at this point.

The only one I am uncertain about is the ChatGPT based one, since its likely going to have a similar effect where their dataset is enhanced by the high quality of ChatGPT. But at the same time I read people complain about it here so perhaps it beats that to?

If you do decide to give it a try clicking the play button on Colab should be enough to get your own private instance, once you have the trycloudflare link open it and go to the settings. Crank the max context all the way up to 4K for the best memory in your story. Then go to the scenarios and pick one of the premade adventure scenarios (The ones with the sword), or use the New Adventure (Alpaca) if you prefer submitting your own introduction like you also can in AI Dungeon.

Its been a while since we had feedback on the model from current AI Dungeon players so I'd love to know how it actually compares.","False","False","False","None","None","None","None","0","1702080022.0","2023-12-09-010022","1702080022.0","None","0","False","0","kckj0ea","False","None","t3_18dzsai","False","None","None","None","[]","t1_kckj0ea","True","0","t3_18dzsai","/r/AIDungeon/comments/18dzsai/how_is_ai_dungeon_nowadays_compared_to_3_years/kckj0ea/","None","","[]","1702080039","False","4","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","1702080053","4","[]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This app lets you create stories of any kind of any style.

You can find and choose characters from shows and real life or even Make Your Own!

Have steamy texts with one character or have An Entire Adventure with a bunch of characters, add them all to a room and talk to them all!

Talk like you would to another person!
Or use ""quotations"" to speak like in a story and *Type like this when you're doing something*

Don't want to subscribe to the monthly/yearly fee?

Don't pay! Watch one and and you can keep having conversations, over and over again, no wait time unless you want to!

It's dumb to compare AiD to any local setup, because a local Ai setup costs a lot of time and money to set up. Yes, you can get the best of everything, but that's you have to build it all yourself. Most people playing Ai Dungeon can't run models locally.

I think your observations line up with what we’re seeing. We wrote about it a bit here. In short, Griffin 2.0 was a big leap forward in coherence that was immediately noticed by players, but over time, it’s felt like it lacks some of its endearing creativity.  https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/186sm1k/i_can_tell_the_ai_is_worse_why_is_latitude/

Banned words is likely going to be deprecated. It’s really not very useful, because it works through logit bias. Essentially, it lowers the likelihood of certain tokens being used, but because we support multiple models, and multiple tokenizers, it’s extremely difficult for players to effectively enter all tokens they’d like to be banned. For instance, the word “Bike” might be a different token from “bike” but also “bicycle”.

Ruby sits across from him at the table. ""I know it's strange but mom isn't coming back. She is just a normal person in another universe and wishes to only know that universe. You've been through worse."" She tells him.


He looks at her. ""Yeah well it's not like before in other incarnations. This... Is from God."" He says holding up a glowing pure white envelope. 


He pulls out a golden paper that glows softly, it's light filling the room with an atmosphere of Love and Patience. It's contents. ""You are to find what's truly important and not idolize.""


Blaze places the paper back inside it's envelope and lays it to the table where it floats without touching.



""I can't believe you've been through so much and cause of something I'm being tested on. You're an amazing person Ruby."" Blaze says feeling lost.


Ruby smiles back at him, her eyes shining with pride. ""Thanks, dad. I'm just doing what I can to keep you safe and protect the ones I love. Things will be ok in the end."" She says optimistically...


...


...


1500 miles away in the throne room within the castle surrounded by Redemption in ruins, a sleek Obsidian dragon stares in the direction a burst of subtle yet infuriating Divine energy came from.


""Seems to be about in the deserts.... If it's him then I'll handle it myself."" It says raising a large bear sized head as it's long black obsidian neck bursts through the overhead walkway. 


It stretches it's long figure and then bursts through what remains of the castle's ceiling.


 As the dragon emerges, it unleashes a deafening roar that shakes the very mountain foundation of the castle. The knights that were still standing scramble to their feet, weapons drawn and shields raised. The dragon's scales shimmer with a faint deep blue light as it lands gracefully on the floor, its massive wings folding behind it with a beautiful crinkle of it's somehow flexible skin.


He looks at his obsidian knights. ""Remain standing guard here at the castle while I handle our former king."" He says.


Taking flight he breaks the sound barrier upon flapping his large demonic wings... Flapping again as he reaches high above the castle the force obliterates a mile of a nearby mountain peak as he rockets away at 10 times the speed of sound.
 



As he soars through the sky, he notices a small group of humanoid dragons flying towards him. ""All dressed in black, perfect for their dinner funeral."" He says amused. 



 He raises his head and lets out a deafening roar, causing the ground to shake beneath them. Changing course he gets serious and closes the 10 miles in the blink of an eye as he devours the head of the lead dragon as his sharp ultra durable obsidian blade tail cuts the other 3 to pieces. A diamond sword soft as butter compared to its edge as the final of the group tries to defend but is split into two as the obsidian dragon finishes his series of attacks and gracefully flies away. 

 


The knights look on in awe at the sheer power and skill of the dragon.

In terms of model degradation, what we’ve noticed is new models usually don’t have the same issues that existing models do, so the initial reception is positive. We had that recently with Dragon J2 and Griffin 2.0, and now Mistral. Over time, players start to discover quirks and flaws in the new models that, I think, makes it feel like the models are worsening over time.

I am very curious to hear more experienced users specific preferences/experiences/observations about Mixtral vs Dragon.

What I usually do is write a plot resembling the game's opening. Also I introduce the player, their objectives, and key characters. Then it's all about using story cards, mapping out locations, characters, and game mechanics, which some people don’t do depending on how simple the scenario is. Once that's set, I start playing out the story, tweaking and adding story cards as needed based on how the narrative unfolds.

For instance, in my FNAF scenario, I'd start it with something like, 'You are ${What is your name?}, a normal ${Are you a man/girl?}, just got hired at the new and improved Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria.' I’ll write about what I need from the game’s story and lore, introducing relevant characters along the way. With a simple ending like 'Looks like it's going to be an interesting night.’

Then, as I play through, I keep an eye out for inaccuracies or areas I'd like to tweak. If something feels off, I’ll use the story cards mechanic, making edits or creating new ones to fine-tune the experience.

Only use it if you fully understand what it does and you are sure that is what you want. By that I don't mean ""you read what other people said you should use it for"". I mean ""you understand where it is instead in context, have thought about what that means what and that does to the flow of your input text"". If after that you decide Author's Note is what you want go ahead. 

Exception to this rule: Putting style instructions into Author's Note is fine. Like this:

As for general quality, image generation seems more or less the same, but novel has more options. Text generation, not sure, which is better for now.

Despite the latitude team's assurance that this is the direction that AID is going,I still think that it shouldn't have been rushed out to users. 

Regardless of users outside of reddit and on social media platforms,first impressions are everything.

And if you make it a bad first impression on other users who aren't a fan of the Phoenix version because of how poorly it performed,then why on earth would you release it out THAT early when they should know to leave it in the oven longer. 

Not going to say here whether or not they have other reasons for benching the Legacy version cause I don't have proof that being the case.

But nevertheless,I do hope they prove my skepticism wrong here despite some users first of it not be a great introduction.

However,if it doesn't and my skepticism/concerns about the Phoenix version are correct,then I call into question about both the team's and ""users"" from other platforms intentions here.

The “Delete to Here” function was removed, but you can still access it by tapping on any text as far up in your story as you’d like, clearing the text, and then typing “/cleartohere” or “/cth” before pressing enter/return. This will clear the story to that spot.

I used Google docs and it took about a half hour as everything under 1000 plays has one page to copy. 1.1k had 2 pages and my 3.5 k had like 4 maybe 5 pages if I recall.

You can also just click the title and whatever AID named the run will be at the top. For very old ""Custom"" and ""Knight"" titled runs I'd just sift through story and add in my characters name to make it more clear which run it was. So ""Knight James"" for example. 

I just made a new Google email just for the stories and copied them into docs (unnecessary personal preference) but if you have office or any other writing program (hell you can use notes) you can get them off the site though desktop no problem. 

It may take longer with those programs because with Google docs I was able to mouse click about 20 open tabs at a time versus having to open one at a time. 

Control+A then Control+Shift+V (to get rid of Ai dungeon format) and wallah. Story that you can save for later and delete your account if you'd like.

There are still about 5 days until legacy is up. I'm sure the new format has an option to collect stories but I haven't used it since they released it and it looks like it would be harder. Someone can correct me on that if you'd like.

I hope this helps.

I've found I can get it to generate a character or a background, but a genuine *scene* is beyond what I can get it to do.

You can get it to use actors/actresses to get a consistent look, although it has some odd biases - if I reference Gal Gadot, I am getting some variation of Wonder Woman no matter what I describe, and it will not reward my crush on Jameela Jamil with a image that actually looks like her, but for a lot of names it does pretty well.

Now, if I was more visual, maybe I would care more and 'git gud', but as it stands I think using credits and playing with it is just about the best use for it. I do have an adventure that is nothing but that, and I like generating images in that for the scenario image so I don't use the generic ones provided.

Some of that was on us (we missed an important part of the mobile build that caused a bunch of bugs for the early rollout), some of that was external factors (like server issues unrelated to Phoenix right when we launched 🤦‍♂️). We're as frustrated as you and other players that this didn't go as smoothly as we wanted it to. And, you're right, we may have lost the faith of some players in the process. 

This probably sounds cliche, but our best path forward is making Phoenix the best version of AI Dungeon ever. The new improvements have made AI Dungeon more compelling to new players, and we're already starting to see old players returning. Phoenix is already letting us make improvements we've never been able to before, and we know that over time AI Dungeon is going to get better and better. 

And, yes, there are still (and probably always will be) players who prefer Legacy, but those numbers are quite low and going down over time. 

I'm not sharing this to try and convince anyone to change their opinion of Legacy or Phoenix. I'm just hoping it provides context for why we're moving forward and how we hope to repair any damaged first impression that was made, which is through listening to feedback and improving the product as fast as we can.","False","False","False","None","None","None","None","0","1703696301.0","2023-12-27-175821","1703696301.0","None","0","False","0","kf55qor","False","None","t3_18pdyv2","False","None","None","None","[]","t1_kf55qor","True","0","t1_kevzhmm","/r/AIDungeon/comments/18pdyv2/will_miss_the_legacy_version/kf55qor/","None","","[]","1703696331","False","2","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","1703713410","2","[]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Would be cool if you add an art to the left signifying you use the ""Story"" command when using it. Or even add a toggle option if you want to see the symbols on the left.

Anyways happy holidays and have a wonderful vacation. Also if you want recommendations you should ask your fellow developers or yourself what you would add to make it better. Also something I've learned from other games (like COC) they make quality of life updates if they're not ready to add something big and new yet.

The story can only really build on what you give it, and then milk that until it's dry. Each scenario will have its own point at which it's too much, depending on the complexity of the tale.

(Have you ever seen Bungo stray dogs? If not thats okay, theres this guy named Kunikida with an interesting ability that might spark your inspiration. Plus a bunch of other abilities that might give you some ideas.)

The Matchless Poet: allows Kunikida to make objects written on the papers of his notebook come into existence. However, it does not work on objects larger than the notebook. Such objects include wire guns, handguns, grenades, and flashbangs.

He is shown to be able to use pre-written notes as a means for his object summons, which can be especially convenient if one of his hands is bound and incapacitated. Also, he is able to remotely activate his ability, transforming pre-written notes into objects, which come in handy when supporting other members from afar.

Here's a bunch of abilities from Bungo Stray Dogs that I think fit pretty well into Jjk:

""The ability to create an alternate dimension called Anne's Room. Anyone who loses a game of tag against the monstrous Anne, who dwells inside, is locked in the dimension forever.""

""The ability to summon Demon Snow, an otherworldly figure resembling an imperial japanese woman that wields a mighty Katana. It does not listen to the users orders, instead doing the bidding of any voice heard over a cell phone.""

""An ability which is able to inflict a virus that targets two hosts. The virus will eat the host's internal organs, if one of the hosts die then the virus will stop infecting the other host. If one of the hosts is not killed then both will die.""

""Nullifies the Ability of anyone he touches.""

""Boosts his physical strength in proportion to the amount of financial assets he consumes. Imagine your power level is dictated by the amount of money you spend.""

Reverse probability: inspired in medaka box. If something or someone is extremely resistant u got a higher chance to hurt or break it, if something is too soft and weak u have a lower chance to hurt or break it. If a Powerful attack hits u, u have a high chance to survive, if a weak attack hits u, u got a low change to survive. I only used combat examples, but this CT also works for day to day situations

The cards currently function very simply: when the keyword appears in the text, the program flashes the relevant cards in the context window. This is the same context which includes your story text, memory, etc.

Cards with common keywords will be prompted very frequently and will affect the balance of the AI's understanding of the weight of your various story elements.

My first few drafts were very card heavy but I have found that short, specific cards make up primarily of keywords and only called up when necessary function much better.

This is a very thoughtful set of suggestions and feedback. Feedback like this is very helpful as we try to improve the game. Would you be interested in joining our Alpha testing program? 

I'll try to respond to some of the high level points.

1. Agree. We made significant progress here (we used to have a third concept called ""Worlds"" that made the situation even more confusing, but helpful to know we still have more work to do. This was something I personally struggled with when I first started playing as well. The memory cards being tied back to the scenario...it used to work that way and it was a mess for a lot of reasons. I'll share more on that. On converting to a Scenario, that's an interesting idea and I can share it with the team. 
2. I think that could work for players who have created their own scenarios.
3. As you've heard, we're working on a UI button that's more discoverable than the ""Erase to Here"" command. It's already been designed and built and will be released soon. 
4. I think this is somewhat of a newer phenomenon. In the past, players have rarely (if ever) changed their model during an adventure. We actually surveyed players (and compared to our analytics) and most players either used the same model all the time, or changed only once per adventure. The proximity of that control was placed accordingly. I do think with the new set of models we have, each with their own advantages, players are changing more frequently than they have in the past and it's something we're keeping an eye on.
5. Yep. We used to have a shared library and it was a mess for both the UI and the architecture. Very few players understood how to use it, and it created confusion for the majority. When we removed this, we were surprised how many of our top creators and power users were actually happy about the change. It was  THAT bad. However, we DO agree there is a lot of value in having a library of Story Cards, and even the possibility of sharing sets with other players. Given the issues we've seen before, we're not planning to rush into this again until we've been able to do a comprehensive design process to make sure it's done in a way that adds the capabilities without bringing back the problems of before. In short, it's being considered, but given the time it will take to do it right, I wouldn't expect to see it in the short term.
6. We're working on something that may address this, although in a different way. We agree that learning to wisely manage your context can dramatically improve the experience.
7. We've been fighting some pesky scrolling and keyboard bugs. We're still working on a few. Sorry about those. I'll have to review the suggestion of highlighting continue and story actions. If I recall there's an architectural reason we can't do that (without doing a significant refactor of the game screen) but I'll have to double check. We do have plans for more theme and style options, so stay tuned. And the newest on top is interesting, but as you suggested, maybe not the right fit for a reading experience.

I think overall, players would describe Mixtral as a ChatGPT-like model without the content restrictions that come with ChatGPT. Players say Mixtral is better than Dragon far more often than they say Dragon beats Mixtral. For instance, they aren't seeing some of the repetitive phrases from Dragon in Mixtral stories. Players also appreciate the larger context length with Mixtral.

There have been a few bugs discovered with MythoMax. There are one or two showing up on Mixtral, which is expected for Early Release models. We're hoping to have most of those resolved after the holiday break. 

My own personal take on all of this is that I think Mixtral will likely be our most used model soon. I think the blend of content flexibility, coherence, and context length are clear advantages over both Dragon and ChatGPT. More and more, I think of models like ice cream flavors. Each model has its own flavor and is better suited for different situations. For instance, if I'm eating an ice cream cone I am going to praline pecan, but with my peach cobbler I want Vanilla Bean all the way. I'm just glad we have more models to choose from based on what you're looking for.

Over time, it wouldn't surprise me if some of the enthusiasm tempers a bit. I think we always see some early excitement around new models, and then over time their strengths and flaws become more clear. Players usually compare new models against the flaws of the older models, but it takes time for the flaws of the new models to show up. So, right now Mixtral is the darling, but I'm sure players will find some quirks for us to improve on (and we will). 

I hope that was somewhat helpful. If you do try it, let me know what you think so I have a better idea what I can share with anyone else who has your same question.

I've since discovered/logged into Legacy to do some quick side-by-side comparisons to Phoenix, just for fun (I like software, lol). To your point #1, right away in Legacy the topmost banner indicates ""Worlds are now Scenarios on Phoenix"", which, as I understand it now, Phoenix's simplified Scenario paradigm seems much easier to build around and to actually use.

The main takeaway for me over in Legacy before I moved back, was that I really enjoy the content-first design direction that things took in Phoenix. I feel like the new interface has more of an ""RPG tavern"" kind of vibe, which just feels like a better space to start telling stories from (to me, at least). 

Curiously though, I did find that the Legacy interface generally felt a bit more ""smooth"" and ""fluid"" during my interactions with it, particularly with animations/transitions like the slide-out menus (particularly the in-game settings menu), vs Phoenix where these updated transitions stutter a bit more. I suspect that this might just be a side effect of Phoenix being more media-heavy than Legacy appears to have been 🤔? It's a small nitpick considering, but it was a noticeable difference (especially on higher refresh rate/120hz screens).

Anyways, regarding the in-game settings menu, I found a little design change that was introduced in Phoenix that basically would neuter my point #4 about making switching AIs/game settings easier: 

I noticed that in Legacy, the in-game settings menu always opens to the last menu you were on (be it ""Story"", ""Art"" or ""Display""). In Phoenix, the in-game menu always opens to the ""Adventure"" tab. I think that, if a user were to flip their AI around as I described in #4, or otherwise be experimenting with their AI's ""Advanced Settings"" to see how they work with the current model/content, it would be very helpful to have the in-game menu always open to the last state it was in rather than always opening to ""Adventure"".

I uploaded a tiny video showcasing the in-game menu behavior side-by-side, to illustrate both of those points: [https://i.imgur.com/jTomEq0.mp4](https://i.imgur.com/jTomEq0.mp4)

Past all that I'm still casually tinkering with things and enjoying my playthroughs, though! This is a really cool space to be operating in. I've been reading about Heroes via the blog and am very excited to see that a lot of the low-level/core design suggestions that had bubbled up in my head as ways that could enrich the experience, are already being actively and creatively met head on with the new Heroes engine & its rethink of long term context/memory. Kudos to the team on all of that, as I think that new style of play will really enhance ""RPG"" playthroughs.

I'm very much in favor of harassing latitude until we get a storycard pool together, although I feel letting storycards in adventures be edited to replace the originals may be courting trouble - I've definitely edited adventure cards and forgotten that I wasn't actually in the scenario, so I get the appeal, but you also publish adventures and that adds another level of complexity to securing that.

You're never sure if you'll like a UI change until you actually use it, but 'Latest on top' as a concept seems horrible. Maybe in practice I'd find out otherwise but I'd definitely like 'Classic' as as option.

For example, I'd prefer using Legacy over Phoenix right now because the QoL options I like are not implemented and I dislike the buttons bar not being ""attached"" to the bottom of my screen when I scroll up.

But I still use Phoenix. Why? I'm lazy and the missing/disliked features are not as annoying as playing on the website version imo. I'm a mobile user, so just starting the app is much more convenient. If Legacy was accessible from the app, I'd use it.

Btw, I'm not a hater of Phoenix, I just don't understand why it's there when the QoL feels so low compared to Legacy atm.
