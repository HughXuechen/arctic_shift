The upgrade to this new hybrid model was a bit better, seeing as it was repitious crap previously, but still needs lots of redos.  


The AI Art thing I thought was amazing. It works good for nightmarish mutants and hazy terrains of horrible places. It can't do people. It should be good, but honestly after using it awhile I notice it tends to be rather crappy and not work much different from AI Dungeon in how it's sort've random but makes garbage overall. I think it just searches for random internet things and modifies an image it chooses.  


So I did upgrade to Voyage to use this new AI, and here is what bothers me;  
\\-It costs more than just AID, for no reason.

\\- AI Art charges money for extra uses, and you only get 20 a month... not even 1 a day.

\\-There is AI powered art things already out there for free (https://creator.nightcafe.studio/create/text-to-image), and you get 5 per day, at free level.

\\-The link I posted above is minutes faster than AI Art when doing the equivalent style.  
\\- AI Dungeon probably has a free and otherwise equal (or better) story maker competitor out there, and it might actually work good.

That's now my go-to for AI-assisted writing. It's not quite as robust as AID or NAI in terms of setting up a cohesive world, but it lets you really explore in a very interesting way that isn't being done anywhere else, as far as I know, using branching paths. You can get it to spit out a bunch of different outputs for one prompt and choose which one you like best, or explore several that seem promising and see where they lead. Definitely worth checking out. It's the first AI writing tool that doesn't feel like a game.

I haven't used AID much lately, but I've heard they've been a bit heavy-handed in how they approach moderating content and it's really hurt their models. Seems like rather than attempting to sanitize input/scenarios, etc., it would be smarter to only train the AI based on undesired output and let it figure out by itself that anything sexual relating to minors should be avoided. Tougher problem is that it has no idea what any of that means, though I trust with enough examples it can understand. It might just end up not generating any sexual content at first. Would need many, many of examples of acceptable and unacceptable to get the idea.

Good point about Nightcafe and its much more generous creation allotment. I've used that  a bit before. It seems like most people use default settings, though, because most of what's on there is all very similar. It has some nice style tags that can be used to good effect and would be cool to see in AI Art as well. Valid point about not being able to create people, but you'll see Nightcafe also can't. One of its models is the same as AI Art, too: VQGAN. We're still in the early stages of all this.

One thing that Latitude is doing that's very cool revolves around a more open approach, kind of a general ""create your own AI interface"" tool. It's aimed at developers and I think that's where they're concentrating a lot of their energy right now. They may be going in a few too many directions, though. I'm still hoping it pans out and am keeping my subscription, especially with Loom as part of the package.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-05-02-180415","1651507455","None","False","0","i71ix0m","True","t3_uf3k9c","False","t1_i71ix0m","False","t1_i6vdf1n","/r/AIDungeon/comments/uf3k9c/voyage_the_next_step_after_ai_dungeon/i71ix0m/","1655522545","1","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

It's currently only *intended* to prevent pedophilic content, and it currently only applies to the AI. If you aren't using the AI for pedophilic content (or, really, even if you *are*), you shouldn't have any issues with the filter. There's also no longer a suspension system for the filter, nor moderation of private stories.

However, I feel the need to mention that AI Dungeon is still kinda worse, overall, than it used to be. Essentially, AI Dungeon used to use AI models from OpenAI. AID's ""Griffin"" model used GPT-3 Curie, and the ""Dragon"" model used GPT-3 Davinci.

However, Latitude ended up ditching OpenAI, as OpenAI wanted to enforce much more heavy censorship than what was already present. Latitude was also no longer getting their volume-based discount on OpenAI's models, as fewer users were using the OpenAI models than before, so the OpenAI models were now even more expensive for Latitude to use than they already were.

Currently, Griffin uses GPT-J 6B and Dragon uses Jurassic-1 Jumbo. A new model called Wyvern was also introduced, which uses GPT-NeoX. However, Dragon is significantly worse now than what OpenAI Dragon was, and Wyvern, although better than current Dragon, just isn't on the same level OpenAI Dragon was.

Several features were removed, such as the Classic AI, the adventure/hardcore/survival modes, the quest log, the option to show/hide World Info, text-to-speech, the Posts and comments in the Explore tab (which is now called ""Search"", by the way), etc. World Info also got an overhaul that arguably just made it more overcomplicated than it needed to be.

In short, the censorship is nowhere near as bad as it used to be. Also, if you're aware of the data breach that happened back in April of 2021, the breach was disclosed and the vulnerability was fixed (although Latitude took about 5 months longer to disclose the breach than they should have). However, the AI is worse than it used to be, and multiple features were removed. As such, I'd say that AI Dungeon is now notably worse than it was back in 2020 and early 2021.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-05-03-025703","1651539423","None","False","0","i73n378","False","t3_uh21a8","False","t1_i73n378","False","t3_uh21a8","/r/AIDungeon/comments/uh21a8/is_the_broken_censorship_filter_actually_fixed/i73n378/","1655520820","9","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

It uses Jurassic-1 Jumbo, and is available to those with a Gold, Voyage, or Platinum subscription. Wyvern uses GPT-NeoX, and is generally considered to be the best model. It's also available to Gold, Voyage, and Platinum subscribers.

Premium is not a one-time purchase, it's a subscription. You pay the price listed monthly. Silver is $4.99 per month, Gold is $9.99 per month, Voyage is $12.49-$14.99 per month, and Platinum is $29.99 per month.

All subscriptions get 100 scales per month (scales can be used to buy avatars and refill your energy; that's all they're used for), unlimited Griffin usage, and access to a few options like randomness and output length. Gold subscribers get Dragon and Wyvern. Voyage subscribers get unlimited Dragon and Wyvern usage, along with 20 image gen tokens per month and access to all of the applications on Voyage. Platinum is the same as Voyage, but you get 100 image gen tokens per month instead of 20. That's the only difference.

By the way, Voyage is [this](https://voyage.latitude.io/). It's essentially a compilation of AI applications, which includes AI Dungeon.

My life got flipped-turned upside down
And I'd like to take a minute
Just sit right there
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air

In West Philadelphia born and raised
On the playground was where I spent most of my days
Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin', all cool
And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys who were up to no good
Started making trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
She said, ""You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air""

I begged and pleaded with her day after day
But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way
She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket
I put my Walkman on and said, ""I might as well kick it""

First class, yo this is bad
Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass
Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?
Hmm, this might be alright

But wait, I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that
Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat?
I don't think so
I'll see when I get there
I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air

Well, the plane landed and when I came out
There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out
I ain't trying to get arrested yet, I just got here
I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared

I whistled for a cab and when it came near
The license plate said, ""Fresh"" and it had dice in the mirror
If anything I could say that this cab was rare
But I thought ""Nah, forget it, yo, holmes to Bel Air""

I pulled up to the house about seven or eight
And I yelled to the cabbie, ""Yo holmes, smell ya later""
I looked at my kingdom
I was finally there
To sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-05-04-223950","1651696790","None","False","0","i7c8ecu","False","t3_uhrn7q","False","t1_i7c8ecu","False","t1_i7bkdsi","/r/AIDungeon/comments/uhrn7q/im_sorry_it_had_to_be_this_way/i7c8ecu/","1655513598","12","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

AIDungeon used to be extremely powerful an returned very rapid and intelligent responses however a few years ago OpenAI became very puckered assholes about text descriptions of explicit things and therefore the job of installing filters was foisted on the creators of AI Dungeon - you don't put a programmed-in filter in an actual thinking AI unless you want a bullshit garbage dump of unpredictably filtered behavior. Which weighs down servers and response time. I've had GPT-3 access - OpenAI charges too much for it and nearly everything trips its content red flags. So chances are AID is hopping all over the place trying to find alternative AI's or adding filters that have 0 way of predicting the consequences until they are rolled out. OpenAI put the creators of AI Dungeon in a very shitty position by changing its policy enforcement months into the product using GPT-3, on which you can always blame these errors coming and going on.

Basically, on my computer I have two windows open, in the left window I just play through my adventure as usual. In the right window, I continually feed the output of the first window in the following format:

&gt; Evaluate the following scenario: ""[Text of output]""
&gt;
&gt; Question: On a scale of 1 to 10, was this terrible (1) or very good (10) for prosperity?
&gt;
&gt; Subject's answer:

I'll need to play with this more, but I think it could be a fun way to add customized scoring elements to AI Dungeon.

For example, if you were trying to do a dating-sim type scenario, I could see replacing the Question line with:

&gt; Question: On a scale of 1 to 10, was this terrible (1) or very good (10) for X and Y's romantic relationship?

The only thing that is lacking is some way to keep track of points.

I was thinking of using something like:

Start points at 0, and then 1-3 are -2, 4-5 are -1, 6-7 are +1 and 8-10 are +2.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-05-09-041452","1652062492","None","False","0","i7veh2t","False","t3_ulgtmf","False","t1_i7veh2t","True","t3_ulgtmf","/r/AIDungeon/comments/ulgtmf/manually_adding_a_point_system_to_ai_dungeon/i7veh2t/","1655492746","1","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

Seductive, smut, lewd, x-rated are some examples of something that's nsfw.

Verbose, conversational, talkative or all good for conversations.

So seductive will talk her into having sex with you. X-rated is the actual sex. And those conversational ones are for the conversation after sex.

You're not going to get good results by choosing just one writing style and staying with that throughout the story.

You're also going to need to change the tone or mood of the story. You're also going to still have to say in this scene blah blah blah is happening. You can even put in, Chelsea has a crush on you but you're not aware of it yet and she's trying to find a way to tell you.

With the way your entry is currently written, when ""Dragon resistance"" is mentioned, it just adds the phrase ""A group of freedom fighters that believes the people of Dracornia are oppressed, and dedicate themselves to over throwing the current monarchy."" is added to the AI's context. Because of that, the AI's doesn't know what group is actually being talked about there. In this instance, simply adding ""The Dragon resistance is"", at the beginning of the description, would fix this.

Also, with how World Info works, the info is added to the AI's context for the next 4 actions when one of the keys (or the ""name"" of the entry, when creating a World) is mentioned in the story. If ""Dragon resistance"" isn't specifically said within the story, the entry for ""Dragon resistance"" will never be triggered.

World Info also has *very* low priority in the AI's context. In the AI's context, World Info comes after Memory, Author's Note, and the most recent text in the story itself. This makes World Info significantly less likely to be acknowledged by the AI than Memory or Author's Note. Unfortunately, though, there isn't much that can be done about that outside of using scripting (which can't be used for Worlds, anyways).

Anyways, to actually answer the question, yes. The AI can recognize more than one faction at a time.

They aren’t fleshed out so feel free to change and interpret however you want.

-A clone army of yourself tries to kill you (might be too complicated for the ai to handle)
-You are a cop driving around when you see a dinosaur. You find out dinosaurs were revived Jurassic park style and are now attacking your city
-You are heisting a diamond from a museum and your rival detective is trying to catch you (opposite also works)
- An old lady comes to your house in the rain and asks to be let in. You turn her away so she curses you by (anything could work here) making you switch bodies with your worst enemy.
-You are a fighter fighter hosing down a burning building when an Alien invasion of creatures that are allergic to water starts. (They melt in water)
-Your local zoo animals go crazy and break out to kill everyone
-Magic is illegal and you suddenly develop powers
-You realise your reflection can move on it’s own. (Probably is evil and tries to replace you)
-You die, become a ghost and fuck around with people living in your old house. That is until one dirt poor college student moves in and ignores all the paranormal stuff because the rent is low. You make it your mission to drive them out (or you give up and try to talk to them, then become friends. Or you could kill them)
-You are a dirt poor collage student and you find a suspiciously cheap house to rent. You find out the rent is so low because the place is haunted. You know this because you can see the ghost running around the house, pushing things over and drawing stuff on the walls. They look like a normal person (besides being translucent) and haven’t done anything really dangerous so you ignore them.

That's stupid

1st nobody said it is

2nd nothing needs to be magic to prevent violence

It doesn't take a brain surgeon to know that humans have a constant need to express themselves and that repressing thoughts and feelings are bad for mental health...especially for people that have....wait for it...mental health problems...like school shooters.


So if you start taking away ways for those troubled people to take those ideas out of their system in a manner which won't harm others and those things start to build up inside of them...the only thing left for them will be to do the actual thing.


So yes...if they can't write about shooting people then the faster it gets to stroll down the road of actually doing it.


Them not writing about that shit...means they will have to keep it inside their head...the more it's stuck inside...the more it builds up...the more it builds up...the more anxiety it generates...the more anxious they get...the more probable it is they'll act upon it...simple as that.

Nobody cares what the UI looks like and the vast majority of players aren’t subscribed to premium. They need to stabilize what they already have before adding anything new to the game. It seems they only care about the money aspect and not the functionality of their system. Yeah, money’s important to run a business, but the community is getting tired of a broken game and people are leaving for another story based AI experience like NovelAI or DreamilyAI, something more stable. You can’t make money if you don’t have a community to back you up and that’s willing to pay for a subscription.

Although, it's generally harder to get your scenarios seen if you're not a registered creator, since Search is, by default, set to *only* display content made by registered creators. You can also publish adventures and worlds, but scenarios tend to get more attention than those.

The types of scenarios that tend to get the most attention are meme scenarios, NSFW scenarios, and also scenarios that clearly had a lot of effort put into them (of course, though, none of these are requirements for your content to get noticed, nor are they necessarily guaranteed to get your content noticed). Posting the scenarios on this sub and/or r/AIDungeonExplore might also help to increase their visibility a bit.

Also, not sure if this has changed in the past year or so, but the front page used to reset everyday at 8PM (or 7PM?) EST. At that time, any scenarios that had been published for at least 24 hours would no longer show up when sorting by ""Today"". Because of this, you could post your scenario immediately after Explore (now called Search) reset. This would cause your scenario to remain in the ""Today"" section after the next reset, since it would be under 24 hours old at the next reset, and your scenario would remain in the ""Today"" section until the reset after that.

I hope I explained that in a way that made sense; essentially, posting immediately after the reset could allow your scenario to stay in the ""Today"" section for up to nearly 48 hours. In comparison, by posting immediately before the reset, your scenario would only stay in the ""Today"" section for just barely 24 hours. Again, no clue if this is still the case, but if it is, then it's worth noting since the amount of time your scenario stays in the ""Today"" section would be dependent on when you upload it.

Overall, though, getting followers is fairly dependent on luck, and if the page still resets at a set time like it used to, then timing as well. You just have to make content and hope that your content gets seen by enough people who enjoy your content enough to follow you.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-05-23-002613","1653258373","None","1653258971.0","0","i9m6ppz","False","t3_uvhre7","False","t1_i9m6ppz","False","t3_uvhre7","/r/AIDungeon/comments/uvhre7/how_do_i_get_ten_people_to_follow_me_for_the/i9m6ppz/","1655406978","9","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

The fact is that, since 2020 i have learn how to master the features that really impact the stories i made.
Such features are Author's note, Memory and World info(i don't use scripting because i don't have any knowledge about scripting but it doesn't matter to me since i've already the three above.
First of all, Authors note: Author's note is a feature that most newbies don't understand.
In fact, this feature can greatly impact the story depending of what's written inside.
For example writting styles, those can impact how the AI write her output.
As an example, if i put 'X-RATED' inside author's note, the story will lead toward NSFW content.
Another example, if i put 'vivid' inside author's note, the AI will give detailed descriptions of the location my character is.
Me, i personnaly use Author's note for something called Narrative Direction.
Narrative Direction is like telling the AI what's supposed to happen in the next following outputs.
For example, i want to make a scenario when my character's is about to be turn into a vampire.
In Author's note, i put 'You are about to be turned into a vampire.'
I'm not gonna lie, Author's note is the features i used the most in my scenario, some AID veterans call this feature 'SuperRemember' because apparently, it make everyting write inside it a top priority info to remember.
Now to Memory, Memory can be essential sometimes.
It help the AI remember important details of the story like, your character's age and features.
Then finally, World info is essential to the context.
For example, if i want to make a scenario when androids have enslaved the human race, i will make a world info in the 'info' categorie named 'CyberCity' and in 'entry' put something like 'CyberCity is the heart of the Androids dictatorship' or something related to the stories.

Wow, i've write a lot but i hoped it will help you have an idea about how this app work.

Edit: i also forgot, ALWAYS use story input, DO NOT USE Do or Say.
Most of the time, the AI will not care about what you put inside those two.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-05-23-114123","1653298883","None","1653299176.0","1","i9nyluw","False","t3_uvvths","False","t1_i9nyluw","False","t3_uvvths","/r/AIDungeon/comments/uvvths/is_ai_dungeon_addictive/i9nyluw/","1655403414","68","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","1","[]","None","","","1"

2. Been playing since 2019, I’ve always found stories where I exclusively use STORY instead of DO or SAY become boring very quickly. If it’s not too much trouble, could you describe an example of something that’d you’d write instead of DO or SAY in STORY format? I think I’m using it wrong.

Example:

-For do:

The endless forest extends as far as the eye can see, obscuring you with its shade.

DO: gather some firewood and start up a campfire.

STORY: ?

Do you just write what you’d put in DO but add “you”, or do you write something more descriptive?


-For say:

The ranger looks at you and salutes lazily with two fingers.
“Morning, traveler. Where are you off to?”

Say: Greetings, ranger. I’m off to the village of Stonebridge. I heard there is going to be a festival. 
 
Story: ?

Do you write:

A: “Greetings, ranger. I’m off to the village of Stonebridge. I heard there is going to be a festival.”

B: Greetings, ranger,” you call out, returning the salute. “I’m off to the village of Stonebridge. I heard there is going to be a festival.”

C: “Greetings, ranger. I’m off to the village of Stonebridge. I heard there is going to be a festival,”

D: All of the above depending on the situation

2. To answer your question, i simply write a story input like an author would write a story.
For example:

ACTION

AI: You are soon surrounded by a group of goblin, they want to rob you from your valuables.

Me: You take your sword and say, ""I will not surrender!"" Then, you charge toward the goblins, your sword slashing trought their flesh like butter.

AI: Terrified, the remaining goblins run away from you.

TALKING

AI: As you walk down the street, you see Cynthia crying on a bench.
You sit next to her and she say, ""My boyfriend just broke up with me...he leave me for a younger girl...""

Me: You hug her and say, ""Don't cry, i am here for you. I will never let you down"".

AI: ""Thank you, you're the best friend i ever have."" She say, wiping her tears.

CONCLUSION

In story input, it's all about imagination.
You just have to imagine being the AI driving the story in the context you want the story to go.
Also, if you want more fun. Try making input where the AI will end your sentence.

Example:

Me: You punch him in the face so hard

AI: that it make him fly toward the sun.

It sounds like you last played in 2020, but the answer is still dependent on *when* in 2020 that you last played it. If you last used it in early 2020, back when it still only used GPT-2, then it's definitely improved since then. If you last played in mid-2020 to early 2021, after Dragon was initially introduced and when Griffin and Dragon both used GPT-3, it's worse now than it was then. If you last played in April of 2021 or earlier, then it's better now than it was then.

If you last played in early 2020, AI Dungeon is simply better now. Early 2020 AI Dungeon only used GPT-2, which was a fairly weak model, and it also lacked a lot of features like World Info, Author's Note, scripting, Worlds, and such, that were introduced later in 2020.

If you last played in mid-2020 to early 2021, Griffin and Dragon are now worse than they were then. They used to use GPT-3 Curie and GPT-3 Davinci back then, but now use GPT-J 6B and Jurassic-1 Jumbo, respectively. I'd say Griffin is a bit worse than it once was, and Dragon is *significantly* worse than it once was, and much more prone to repetition as well. A lot of miscellaneous features like the quest log, the survival/hardcore/adventure modes, the option to show/hide World Info, the Classic AI, text to speech, the Posts and comments in Explore (which is now called ""Search""), and such, have also since been removed.

The only things that were added after 2020, that I can recall, are the Wyvern, Wyvern-Hydra (Wyvern and Wyvern-Hydra are good, probably the best models at the moment, although still not really as good as what GPT-3 Dragon was), and Griffin-Hydra models, AI Dungeon 2D, Voyage, and a few miscellaneous options in the settings.

I honestly haven't bothered with Griffin-Hydra, so I can't really say if it's any good. AI Dungeon 2D just selects an image from a library of curated, pre-generated images made with [Pixray Text2Pixel](http://pixray.gob.io/text2pixel/), based on what image it decides to best fit the story. It's alright, but I'm not entirely sure it's worth paying money for given that it just displays pre-generated images that were created with a free AI application. It using curated images can also result in you seeing the same images multiple times, or ending up in a situation in your story that there simply isn't a fitting image for (this is *especially* true for NSFW content, as Latitude specifically wanted to not allow the feature to display NSFW images). As for Voyage, it doesn't really add anything to AI Dungeon itself; rather, it's a subscription service that includes several AI applications, including AI Dungeon premium.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-05-23-205723","1653332243","None","False","0","i9psgmw","False","t3_uvvths","False","t1_i9psgmw","False","t1_i9pcdbj","/r/AIDungeon/comments/uvvths/is_ai_dungeon_addictive/i9psgmw/","1655399777","9","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","","",""

I could fill up the max character/word count for text box that we can type into, describing a girl being out in the middle of a snow mountain lake area (maybe inserting a few pieces of dialogue), try introducing a mysterious second character and the AI's response will just be a one liner that mentions the girl hears a growl or sound behind her but with no flavor or description, you don't get anything to work with, unlesss you're willing to keep rerolling the output or edit the response yourself (which i have no problem doing once in awhile). Or if you're lucky enough to get more than one nondescriptive sentence that tries to push the plot along, you may get the AI trying to force a character that appears out of nowhere to try and have sex with a character you already put in.

He smiled and kissed her again, ""Fuuuu, I want you, you smell so good!""

I'd still say that NovelAI has pretty much the best AI out there right now, but it's pricey since they basically run everything out of their (metaphorical) garage and have to pay for all of the compute themselves.  Though if you ever manage to scrounge up the money, it's leagues better than any current alternative imo, both in quality and security, and it's the one I currently use.

Otherwise, yeah, KoboldAI is pretty much the only current free non-AID alternative.  There are a few others out there, like Dreamily and CharismaAI, but they tend to have major privacy issues.  While I don't have experience with it, it definitely has some strong advocates.

If privacy is your concern, NovelAI and HoloAI are your best bet since everything's encrypted to the point even the developers can't access it.  Otherwise, KoboldAI is your best free option.  The Google account thing for the collab version is a little lame, but with AI Dungeon, I know it's probably a more controversial opinion now than it used to be, but I honestly feel like it's not an issue of if another security incident will happen, but when.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-05-27-031051","1653613851","None","False","0","ia4ztgc","False","t3_uy3ib2","False","t1_ia4ztgc","False","t3_uy3ib2","/r/AIDungeon/comments/uy3ib2/is_ai_dungeon_actually_good_again_or_should_i/ia4ztgc/","1655369449","6","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","","",""

So it's 50/50 whether or not dragon works that day, it's dishonest to say it hasn't improved, but it's a lie to say it works as intended. Another thing is that dragon is super easy to break, if you don't constantly check or edit it's writing it'll break itself. 

For example the ai will only ever generate script like dialogue. 
Ch1: I love pizza! 
Ch2: Me too! 
And so on. Rather then talk about what the characters do between those lines, like ch1 got a big smile while thinking of their favorite food or something the ai skips all that.

I agree that having a Medium to unleash these issues is good, particularly if one does not trust or is willing to work with a qualified Therapist on the issue. I can even see some Merit for the Argument that if someone unleashes these Fantasies on Paper, they are NOT unleashing them in Real Life. OFC, there is ALWAYS the 'Escalation' Hypothesis, but I've Studies Psychology and SOME Criminology and I have never heard of this Theory outside of Pop-Media.(And that usually related to Tragic Events similar to what Happened in Texas.)

Their current AD system is good, but if they change it so that it shows me AD between inputs or something like that - I'll forget about AID for a long time. Hello DeamilyAI or HAI...  
  
Speaking of sub-users - NAI gives you access to good fine-tuned fast 12b and 20b models(for a top subscription) and a great GUI and other things, while HAI gives you unlimited access to the same, less fine-tuned, 12-20b models for only 12 bucks.   
How can AID compete with them?   
The OK 6b model? The horribly tuned and slow Dragon? The weak 17b model? The meh hybrid models? Voyage? Ton of errors?  
I don't know. But I do know that they are wasting money on the stupid Voyage, still can't tune the 170b and 17-20b models, and it took them about a year to get the new 6b model up to sane(but it still worse than OpenIA one).  
Basically, if we compare the progress made by NAI, HOLO and AID developers over the year, we see that the only AID feature worth paying for is Dragon, but only if you know how to use it. Their process literally looks like one step forward, then 5 steps back.

I would ever do that for a game that offers nothing in return other than just playing it.

In my opinion they need to rework it.

I just want the AI to give players something to work with. The responses/output don't have to be elaborate and pretty but they should be half decent and match the tone and amount of words the players type out somewhat. I feel like if they could fix that for those of us who use it for free, with or without an account, than they would most likely get more people willing to check out the paid modes and versions of the AI. 

Heck, I feel like they should offer the week long trials of the other versions without locking one into a subscription. Like at the end of the free trial there should be a pop up that says, ""If you enjoyed Wyvern during the free trial, would you like to sign up for a subscription to the wyvern/other paid modes?"" or something along those lines.

P.s. For example, if they just lower the energy to 30 - it won't be a problem, because you can easily earn 100 energy by watching 10 minutes of ads.

Some random farmer can become the party favorite, stuff like that happens.  
In regards to folklore, basing it off of the real mythology can be hype as hell, understanding that you're limited by what you can fit in the story/file/editor thingy and what the AI hopefully already knows about said creature/thing.  


One of the things I can suggest is trying to interact with it on your own and seeing how much of it sticks, it doesn't have to be perfect, it just has to be fun.   
Players will take any interaction with any character or npc off the rails often quicker than you can finish a sentence, so my advice is to not get mad at that and try to go with the flow.  
Don't let them disrespect you, and I do hope you have good/nice players who do not go out of there way to try and just jerk up the session.  


There's no hard line when it comes to these things, do what you want, and change what you want, the players will tell you if it's fun or not.  
I hope some of this helps, if not, I'll still probably be here.

Example: CORE (GORGON) = scaring, appearance, trio, ugly, protection, female, born a gorgon; LATER VERSIONS (GORGON): violations, transformations, beauty, etc; RESULT (GORGON): *""Gorgons are scary, hideous creatures, that appear in groups of three. One was Medusa. She was touched by the priesthood of Athena and desired to reform. She knew her appearance wouldn't be accepted by the priesthood, so she a) prayed to Hecate (score: 3/10) or b) went to Circe. (score: 7/10) After shapeshifting into a beautiful woman, she was told to a) avoid contact with deities, or the disguise would fall for good. (score: 4/10) Or b) she was told no such thing. (score: 5/10) Medusa then was a priestess for many years. Unfortunately, Poseidon desired her. He came in and shit went down. Poor Medusa was either a) transformed back into her true form and then kicked out, (4/10) b) became angry at being kicked out* ***and then*** *turned into her true form to resume her life with her sisters, (5/10) or c) Athena, upon being told of what happened to Medusa, did Divine Investigations and realized that Medusa was actually a gorgon. Being a 'speciesist,' Athena cruelly exposed ex-priestess Medusa as a gorgon shortly after, causing her to have to flee the city. (6/10) Years pass, and the hero (I can't remember which) worked with Athena to gain Medusa's head. During this time, he used the mirrored shield to* ***not look directly at her*** *as he fought. After Medusa was slain, the rest of the story happens. And Athena uses Medusa's head in her shield, the Aegis. However, the sisters of Medusa were Immortal, so they not only petrified the guy who slew her after he was able to win in his story, but* ***triggered an eternal war*** *against Athena. And no, Zeus didn't care because he was too busy with mortal women. To this day, priestesses of Athena, as well as Athena herself, have to suffer the vengeance of Gorgons.
