No. Private adventures aren't moderated. They've added ChatGPT as an option in the beta and even that isn't moderated. Censorship is instead done in the training of the model. Only published content is moderated.

>Have there been any other controversies since I left?

No. Just complaints that the models suck, but they've improved over time. They're pretty good right now.

>Has the AI improved or gotten worse since then?

Griffin is ""better"" but a lot of people complain that isn't good enough. That said, it is 100% free to use with no limits so complaints are kinda mild most of the time.

Dragon is on a new model now. IMO it's better than the old OpenAi dragon because it uses World Info well. 2.1 is the best iteration of it. 2.0 is OK, but likes to wax poetic a lot lol.

And yeah, all this time they were making it less of a game - no judgebot, no points, no quests, no win conditions, no survival mode. That was unique.

NovelAI has great interface. I wrote a few things when I was subscribed for a month last year.

Astrodrake
Chapter 1: A Glimpse of Cosmic Shadows
Seeding the first chapter...

Setting the scene...

Narrator : You stand in the heart of Astrodrake, a sprawling city of gleaming towers that pierce the sky. Neon lights dance upon the horizon, painting the streets with vibrant hues. But as you gaze up, you catch a glimpse of a colossal shadow darting through the stars, filling you with both wonder and dread.

Snox :

Narrator : As you marvel at the sight of the cosmic dragon, Vera, a young engineer with a mischievous grin, approaches you. ""Snox, my friend! Have you seen the latest creation I've been working on?"" She gestures towards a sleek, metallic robot standing nearby. ""It's designed to explore the outer reaches of space. Care to join me on its maiden voyage?"" You can either accept Vera's offer and embark on a daring adventure or politely decline and continue your own pursuits in Astrodrake.

Preparing conversation with Vera...

Vera : Hey there, Snox! How's it going? I've got something amazing to share with you. I've just finished building a prototype for a new spacecraft that can explore the far reaches of space. Wanna join me on a daring adventure?

Snox : Drats Vera whacha goin to space fer? We got everythin we need down ere!

Vera : Oh, Snox, I understand that life on Earth is pretty great, but space is the final frontier! There's so much out there that we haven't even begun to discover. Just think of the possibilities! New planets, alien life, and who knows what else. It's all waiting for us to explore and uncover its secrets. Plus, think of the incredible technological advancements we could bring back to benefit life on Earth. It's an opportunity of a lifetime! So, what do you say? Ready to embark on this daring adventure with me?

Snox : Why I oughta. . . ! You kids with your information implants! Back in my day we'd be burn'n our brains study'n arcane physics but you young'ns just download what those up top want you to think right into yer brains! And now you think you can do anything! What are we gonna find out that no one else has? Just leave me to rott on this wretched planet.

Vera : Whoa, Snox, take it easy. I get that you might be skeptical about all this new technology, but hear me out. Yes, information is more accessible now, but that doesn't mean we can't still make our own discoveries. This project is about pushing the boundaries of what we know, venturing into the unknown, and seeing things for ourselves. It's not about what others want us to think, but about our own curiosity and desire to explore. And who knows, maybe we'll stumble upon something extraordinary, something that nobody has ever seen before. Isn't that worth taking a chance on? Come on, Snox, let's dare to dream together!

Snox : But. . .who'd repair the Repair Bots while were away? What if someone steals my Butter transport droid? I. . . I can't go out there, I'd break my ol bones.

Vera : Snox, I understand your concerns. But don't worry, I've got it all figured out. While we're away, I've made arrangements for a skilled team of engineers to take care of any repairs that may be needed. As for your Butter transport droid, I promise to keep it safe and secure. And don't worry about your bones, we'll take all the necessary precautions to ensure your safety. We'll have state-of-the-art medical equipment on board and a team of experts to take care of any health concerns. Trust me, Snox, we'll be in good hands. So, what do you say? Ready to embark on this daring adventure?

Snox : I. . . Ughh fine you whippersnapper! If you so badly want to see me get eaten by space slime then I guess I have no choice but to join you on your fancy floating coffin on tour to touch far away rocks. To the vast emptiness of the void, can't wait.

Vera : Yes, Snox! That's the spirit! I promise you, this won't be some boring tour. It'll be an exhilarating journey filled with excitement and discovery. We'll have the chance to witness things that most people can only dream of. And hey, who knows, maybe we'll even find a way to outsmart that space slime! So buckle up, Snox, because we're about to embark on the adventure of a lifetime. Get ready to explore the vastness of the cosmos and make history together! It's going to be epic!

Exiting conversation...

Narrator : I exit the conversation with Vera and scan my surroundings. The bustling streets of the utopian city of Astoria stretch out before me. A group of children playfully chase each other, their laughter echoing through the air. A majestic cosmic dragon soars overhead, its scales shimmering in the sunlight. The enchanting melodies of street musicians fill the air, mixing with the hum of futuristic technology. The city pulses with life, but beneath it all, a sense of impending cataclysm lingers.

Snox : I climb into Vera's spaceship

Narrator : I climb into Vera's spaceship, marveling at the advanced technology that surrounds me. The control panel hums with power, and the starry expanse beyond the window beckons with both wonder and trepidation. As we prepare for takeoff, I can't help but wonder what adventures and dangers await us in the vastness of space.

Preparing conversation with Vera...

Vera : Hey there, Snox! Ready for our grand adventure through the cosmos? Hold on tight, because we're about to embark on a journey that will take us to the farthest reaches of the universe! Just imagine the wonders we'll witness, the mysteries we'll uncover, and the excitement that awaits us. I can't wait to show you what lies beyond the stars! Are you as eager as I am?

Snox : Clearly not, anyways kiddo, where are we going?

Vera : Oh, come on, Snox! Don't tell me you're not excited! But no worries, I'll make sure to ignite that sense of wonder within you. As for our destination, well, the beauty of our journey is that it's open-ended. We'll be venturing into uncharted territories, exploring new star systems, and encountering fascinating celestial phenomena. The universe is vast, my friend, and there are countless wonders waiting to be discovered. So buckle up and get ready for a thrilling ride!

Snox : Fine, If you are so insistant on not filling me in with the specifics then I'd shut my ol trap but it better not be one o' those Slime Planets! Back in my day slime didn't even have two brain cells to put together but now they are an intelligent species? Worlds gone mad.

Welcome to Pizzaria, a world where every street corner is adorned with the greasy glory of pizza restaurants.

But fear not, for amidst the gluttony, suicide prevention hotlines stand ready to save the poor souls overwhelmed by the cheese-induced existential crises. And for those seeking a more liberating experience, the nudist camps offer a chance to embrace their natural selves while enjoying a slice of pepperoni. Truly, Pizzaria is a place where crust is king, and clothes are optional.

I mean, on the otherside by not censoring it, it might make it impossible to play as non-straight people since NPCs would show up calling the player a pedo when they are only attracted to adults around the same age as themselves.

I've been playing around the new saga feature, more precisely prompting it to roleplay as the world of attack on Titan and I must say that I'm pleasantly surprised by the overall coherence the ai is able to maintain through the whole experience ! I've had rather unpleasant experiences with character ai where I just had to teach him about the intricate details of each AOTs character but here, it seems like the ai knows how to fetch and retrieve data about whatever we ask him to search for. I was able to go through a quite immersive experience as a character within the world of titans, while also not having to impose any scenario on the RP since it even prompted by itself interesting and manga coherent events ! 

The only few downsides that I can recall about Saga is that few tweaks and optimisation on mobile devices may be needed, it is a bit on the slower side when used in a navigator on a phone but nothing too alarming. And also (I may ask a stupid question here), is it normal that, as I'm writing this comment, I can't seem to generate any more responses from free-form saga?

Between 2000 and 4000 characters, depending on the text box.

>2. What exactly do the circles in world info do? (the ones that become blue once you click them)

Blue is active, white is inactive. Only active info is read by the Ai.

>3. Are the NSFW options solely for corny stuff? Will the violence and maturity of the story be affected by them?

It affects sex, violence, and language.

>4. Does making a separate location that exists within another larger one work? Or does the AI mess it up?

It usually works fine. Using a single world entry for both is more consistent, but two separate entries also works OK.

>5. Is there a way to put something mysterious/hidden in the world, like a secret location, without spoiling it for players?

You can place it in World Info directly (not using the Worlds factions tab).

>6. There are ways to export/import characters and objects to an ongoing story?

View Adventure -> Options (three dots) -> Edit Adventure. Scroll to the bottom and click World Info. The Active tab will show all entries uses by the adventure (usually provided by the scenario or world). You can go into the other tabs to search for entries not included in the adventure and add them by clicking the Add button.



>7. Is there a simple way of making ""faction-less"" locations? I've created the ""Unaligned"" faction as a way to make locations that don't belong to any factions. Does this strategy work?

All locations are factionless unless otherwise stated in their description. The buttons in the Ui for factions are outdated as the feature was removed a long time ago. If you look at the world info for factions or locations, that data is not saved anywhere.

>8. What are some hints and tricks you can teach me?

- The Ai does not cross-reference World Entries in a single reply, but if an entry generates a key for another one, it can read that in the next generation. This can be exploited to ensure some topics do not appear at the same time by placing them in separate entries. Or you can increase the likelihood of them occurring simultaneously by having the entries share some info in common.

- you can create your character in the Memory box. It is read every generation. Use ""You"" instead of ""I"". You can describe anything about your character there, including your current quest or goal and any NPC's they should know.

- You can create a ""faction"" for players to belong to no faction.

- World Info remains even if the world is deleted so if you accidentally delete a world, you can rebuild it. Once you modify a world info entry, the tabs in World Editing/Creation only affect the description. You can add extra detail to World choices in World Info and have much more space. Content in the ""Entry"" box is not shown to the player, content in ""Description"" is. 

- You can (and should) include extra details in your World Info. Despite the tabs and categories, you can add anything you want: history, future events, minor factions, characters, locations, etc. These help the world become fleshed out.

- Your world name does not need to be the actual name of the world. It can be the title like a game or book. For example, a WW2 World can be named ""The Fall of the Axis"" and wntry/description can describe the setting and war. This can let you organize your Worlds more interestingly.

- Beware of using your world name in location names as they can get brought up too frequently. For example in my Cyberpunk World called ""Theta"", there is a ""Theta Docks"" location. Therefore, anytime I mentioned Theta, the city the world takes place in, the docks usually got referenced. This lead to most adventures taking me to the docks. To fix it, I had to remove ""Theta"" from the World Info Key.","True","False","False","None","None","None","None","0","1692560936.0","2023-08-20-214856","1692560936.0","None","0","False","0","jx1dw6l","False","None","t3_15wdoy4","False","None","None","None","[]","t1_jx1dw6l","True","0","t3_15wdoy4","/r/AIDungeon/comments/15wdoy4/im_a_noob_and_got_some_questions_about_how_to_use/jx1dw6l/","None","","[]","1692560941","False","1","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","1692560968","1","[]","",""

> You can create a ""faction"" for players to belong to no faction.
> 
> World Info remains even if the world is deleted so if you accidentally delete a world, you can rebuild it. Once you modify a world info entry, the tabs in World Editing/Creation only affect the description. You can add extra detail to World choices in World Info and have much more space. Content in the ""Entry"" box is not shown to the player, content in ""Description"" is.
> 
> You can (and should) include extra details in your World Info. Despite the tabs and categories, you can add anything you want: history, future events, minor factions, characters, locations, etc. These help the world become fleshed out.
> 
> Your world name does not need to be the actual name of the world. It can be the title like a game or book. For example, a WW2 World can be named ""The Fall of the Axis"" and wntry/description can describe the setting and war. This can let you organize your Worlds more interestingly.
> 
> Beware of using your world name in location names as they can get brought up too frequently. For example in my Cyberpunk World called ""Theta"", there is a ""Theta Docks"" location. Therefore, anytime I mentioned Theta, the city the world takes place in, the docks usually got referenced. This lead to most adventures taking me to the docks. To fix it, I had to remove ""Theta"" from the World Info Key.

I will tell you though in order to get the max out of your subscription use the authors note in your adventure prompt settings to change up the writing style or themes. For example I put in: 
Writing style: narrative, gritty, arousing, zany, strikingly elegant, talkative.

Themes: arcane, fantasy, adventure, romance.

Genre: cyberpunk, apocalypse. 

And this helps the AI produce better more descriptive responses. Use your memory to help the AI remember things throughout your adventure, for example relationships or even inventory, i.e ""You have a rope and a flashlight""

You can also change up the temperature so that the AI doesn't get stuck repeating lines, I have mine on temperature: 1.2

The primary difference between subscriptions is the amount of tokens for the image gen (Which personally is serviceable but I use midjourney for image gen, it only has anime and furry styles)

Pre-made worlds are a thing, just not built into the app/website. The current way to import things people have made is to download them and drag them into the Novel AI website. This can be specific modules (Which influence the writing style, e.g Fantasy, Dark fantasy etc.), Scenarios, and World Info. So join the discord for all this stuff. As for wanting to live in an existing world, using text adventure mode and letting Karya's imagination run wild is a pretty good way to feel like you're in a world and not having to create the world yourself.

The two main AI you'd find yourself between are Katya and Clio. Karya is incredible, it's descriptive, has this really unique style to it, and has this strange amount of personality to it, sometimes it felt like real people. Clio is good, not as good, but good. It's main appeal is that it has triple the amount of memory that any other AI has, even with the cheapest subscription, which is brilliant for using large amounts of world info. 

Every model for NAI is uncensored, it was made with that in mind when AID implemented very poor censorship, and it's great. For whatever reason, the AI are incredibly talented at generating NSFW

However, due to issues with the Play Store, quitting the beta might not immediately switch things over so that your device downloads the Legacy app for the reinstall. This can result in you still getting the beta installed even though you're out of the beta.

Latitude's help site has instructions for a workaround. Note: This requires you to have all other apps on your device updated already. Otherwise, you might just have to wait until your device decides to sync back to the Legacy version on its own.

Basically the AI has 'the same liberties as you' and you are together writing an ongoing story.

I don't think there is a way to prompt it in such a manner that it leaves your character completely alone. Luckily you can take the way it writes your character as a ""suggestion"" and just change it's entry to the way you would react instead. You can then delete parts that don't fit anymore contextually. I recommend to copy and delete the last sentence, or even mid sentence, so that you don't have to write anything more additional, but just use the copied sentence in your message box.","True","False","False","None","None","None","None","0","1692963210.0","2023-08-25-133330","1692963210.0","None","0","False","0","jxoi0c0","False","None","t3_160mt6q","False","None","None","None","[]","t1_jxoi0c0","True","0","t3_160mt6q","/r/AIDungeon/comments/160mt6q/the_one_thing_i_want_to_see/jxoi0c0/","None","","[]","1692963225","False","1","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","1692963240","1","[]","",""

An Abbreviated History.

OpenAi updated their policy for thwir model and didn't want it used for violence or NSFW. Latitude started working on a exemption for Ai Dungeon. Then OpenAi was caught using data from Ai Dungeon users. Latitude went silent for a couple months. Latitude announces a filtering system. It was rushed and blocked a ton of content. They scrambled to address all the concerns. Some social elements of the game like Explore Tab were removed. 

Not Ling after all that, Latitude broke ties with OpenAi and started making their own models using Ai21. They were atrocious for a LONG time, but filtering had been moved into model itself and unpublished content was not monitored. 

Today, they still use Ai21 but have upgraded a few times. The app is now totally free with no usage restrictions. Upgrading gets you Dragon and ChatGPT as models. They're also working on upgrading the Ui and it's in a public beta.

>I honestly don't see why its still a thing in its current state

Because it is 100% free and one of the few options like that. Most others cost money.

I think AID is better than it used to be, you can have Dragon-J2 now on the lowest premium tier, and it's much better than Wyvern was (honestly I arguably had a worse time with Wyvern than Griffin...), the censorship stuff still exists but I very rarely run into it compared to when it first dropped (where it has false positives constantly), and, overall, it still works well for me for the most part.   
I guess I never particularly cared about the controversies nearly as much as people seem to, so I'll stick to it.

I've tried and then avoided the new version. For my personal taste it was too bloaty, too unintuitive with its settings and layouts and performing much worse than legacy.

Of course, due to it being in Beta, it was also missing features that I use a lot, such as the 'undo to here' function and of course world info not being available.

I'm also gonna be THAT person, pointing out that all the images available for stories were very... straight and missing a bit diversity.

Personally, I also don't need all the animations and flashy designs, because I use AI Dungeon for text adventures - that's it. I want to write, read and prompt the AI to create text. Legacy worked just fine and was a clean UI.

Maybe I'll be surprised... but if the severe difference in performance can't be addressed and if it worsens my experience on my phone, it'll be hard justifying a re-sub. I just want a clean and uncomplicated way to use AID.

We agree that there’s still work to do on Phoenix, we’re definitely not saying it’s ready to cut over right now.

The performance issues you mentioned are very high on our priority list. We expect those to be resolved before the transition.

Our goal has been to make AI Dungeon more intuitive (ie easier to figure out without instruction) without changing things too dramatically, since it’s hard for existing players to adapt if it’s too different. Our user research and usability testing has suggested we’ve improved how intuitive it is, new players have a MUCH easier time picking up AI Dungeon now. But, as you said, we’ve interrupted some longstanding habits from our long-time players. Curious whether you feel there are any of these patterns that are essential to bring back? Or whether you’re feeling the pain of change, which is hard. Genuinely interested because you’re not alone there and we want to get this right. 

Performance is a top priority for us too. We’re getting there. We’re supporting a lot of new tech right now, and doing it on multiple platforms is tricky but we’re making progress. Our threshold is to meet or exceed the Legacy performance before switching. 

The “two clicks” to exit is part of our new play menu. It gives a home to important play features like credits, scales, actions, etc, profile details, etc. Multiplayer features will live there as well. It’s going to be an important part of the experience. We got feedback from players as well that it was a bit TOO easy to close an adventure before, and it could happen on accident. The extra step ensures exiting is an intentional choice. So, that’s a little glimpse into why we added that menu.","True","False","False","None","None","None","None","0","1693490098.0","2023-08-31-155458","1693490098.0","None","0","False","0","jyiqq7m","True","None","t3_165qkdm","False","None","None","None","[]","t1_jyiqq7m","True","0","t1_jyii2br","/r/AIDungeon/comments/165qkdm/new_blog_post_sharpening_our_focus_on_ai_dungeon/jyiqq7m/","None","","[]","1693490114","False","1","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","1693490130","1","[]","",""
