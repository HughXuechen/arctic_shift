20240601-021900,yummymario64,t2_ant8m,"Now that I start to think about it I can't think of a whole lot that character.ai has over AI Dungeon off the top of my head. As of writing this comment, the quality of the AI output is seemingly the same across both, though AI dungeon (in my personal experience) is more likely to remember important things for longer. This is with just the free ai models, and the free context length, by the way.  
  
Though if you are using it as a chatbot, CAI won't treat it like an RPG. Introducing new characters, plot points, et cetera, unless specifically provoked to with definition entries, so that is one thing CAI seems to have over AI dungeon.  
  
I say that AI dungeon is definitely better-structured for text adventures, since you have more options to determine how the world itself is structured, what, with story cards which can potentially interlink to give more cohesive-seeming world. All of this is not taking into account the new memory system, which I've heard is amazing, though I haven't tried it myself since I'm not a premium user.",l6kgu4r,t3_1d526mk,t1_l6kgu4r,t1_l6kf534,/r/AIDungeon/comments/1d526mk/has_ai_dungeon_redeemed_itself/l6kgu4r/,2,2,1717337951,[],,,False,,,,[],,,,text,False,False,False,[],,,False,False,False,,,,,0,1717208340,1717208340,,0,False,0,False,,False,,,,[],True,,,,,1717208355,False,False,True,False,AIDungeon,t5_29uaei,r/AIDungeon,public,,0,[],,[]
