My ex-bots (configured as a narrator) handled text adventures much better, faster, and easier than Dragon, especially when it comes to character interaction or dialogues (even 3 characters in a scene). Sure, you have some limitations for text adventures gameplay, such as no editing, WI or memory, and you need some time to set up and test the scenario, but that's not a problem, at least for me.

Dragon/Wyvern, on the other hand, is much easier to set up, but it has problems even with 2-character scenarios, like ""the AI is stumped"" errors that cause me to delete \\~half or even more of my scenarios.

Going back to Pygmalion+tavern... Well, it's worse than CAI in some things (like you feel that AI is weaker). And you have almost the same limitations as CAI. But, on the other hand, it feels stronger and much easier to handle than the Griffin or Wywern, maybe even Dragon (at least in the scenarios I have tested, where you interact, spend time etc. with preconfigured character and scenario. This is a fairly common type of scenarios among the AID community, to be said). The most interesting thing - this model is based on EleutherAI's GPT-J-6B, so, basically, it's kinda Griffin. And if Latitude tries to adapt this model (or model+tavern) for AID, it could be a win-win for some users, especially free one.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2023-02-01-212050","1675282850","None","1675283213.0","0","j6tmj0n","True","t3_10qtyak","False","t1_j6tmj0n","True","t1_j6t2fwo","/r/AIDungeon/comments/10qtyak/a_few_words_about_pygmalion/j6tmj0n/","1678288664","2","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None"

Again, look, I think you'll agree that the only AI that works well with memory is Dragon. But there's one little detail here, Dragon has, in general, very little memory. So, there are also its own limitations on memory usage, and that's on top of the AI's problems.   
  
In general, in Pygmalion+tavern settings can be changed on the fly, but I did not check whether they apply immediately, or as in CAI, ie when you start a new chat. The first message is changes on start of a new chat, for sure. But I haven't checked the rest, because of the TPU collab...

Krake has a lot of issues, if you push the model it will output a good story, but it has bias towards certain things and will inject them into ever scenario same with Euterpe.   
Dragon is like Griffin with it's outputs but it only has 800 context tokens currently so it is rather tricky to work with it also has similar problems with being bias towards similar content Euterpe and Krake are bias towards.   
Wyvern will go from being really great to Euterpe/Krake levels of boring/stubborn and you might struggle to continue a story.  
The main selling point for NAI is it's modules, without them I have gotten better outputs from the base models on Kobold Ai that they seem to struggle with.  
Sorry if this is long winded.  


TL;DR: My tier list would be Griffin, Dragon, Sigurd, fairseq(base Euterpe/Kobold Ai), Euterpe, Neo X(base Krake), Krake, Wyvern  


My opinion is subject to change depending on if Ai dungeon gets modules or if NAI releases the V2 modules and it allows for more control over what is in their finetune. Also I am basing my opinion on how long the stories I have are, how far I was able to get into a story, if I was able to complete a story or chapter, frequency of retries, and frustrations with a model that stifles creativity to the point I need to take a break for a few days because I was frustrated with the outputs and stubbornness of some of the Ai models.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2023-02-03-200919","1675451359","None","False","0","j736e3y","False","t3_10l9u6i","False","t1_j736e3y","True","t1_j5vlk5t","/r/AIDungeon/comments/10l9u6i/is_the_nsfw_filter_gone/j736e3y/","1678276504","1","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None"

It depends on preference of what type of experience you want.

Do is also very enjoyable, so feel free to experiment even swap between the two depending on what type of story you want.

I think TavernAI is like CharacterAI And PygmalionAI but i dont know much about it.

It really depends on what you want really, as for who the best is, i wouldnt know because i havent tried them all, i personally use AI dungeon because its the one im the most familiar with, and for chatbots i use CharacterAI simply because its the most accesible, although from what ive heared PygmalionAI is strictly superior, but its still in early access, so its very rough arround the edges

&amp;#x200B;

as for my personal recommendation: I recommend either AI Dungeon or NovelAI for the ones that would want to pick as your main.

I tried the ERP and so far it's... iffy. My bot seems to have more awareness of terminology and possibilities, but her memory of setup/context only goes back one or at most two poses.

Lastly, the subscription page advertises ""unlimited roleplay"", implying that roleplay is limited for free users. Would you happen to know *how* limited it is for free users?

Edit: Actual last question: What's the point of the spin-off apps (Anima AI Boyfriend and Anima AI Girlfriend)?

There *was* a hardcore mode at one point where death was permanent, but that was removed quite a while back.

Basically, it's not supposed to be difficult. There's no downside to dying, and thus no reason to fear death. It's primarily just intended to generate text adventures and CYOA stuff. If you really want to die more, I suppose you could try saying that you *try* to do [Insert action].

Best way to adapt to the situation is to set your stories in a world where the strangeness makes sense… Gravity Falls, Twin Peaks, Night Vale, the SCP universe, Warehouse 13, etc…

For example;

You smile, and say, ""There you go, girl! That's why we're here! Now let's go find some trouble, together!""

Cara gives you a playful nudge, and says, ""I can't wait!""
The two of you exit the car, and approach the nightlife district. You put your arm over Cara's shoulder, and then put your arm around her waist, as you walk along the sidewalk together.

You both walk along the sidewalks, watching the bizarre sights and sounds of the nightlife district, and you both laugh and comment on all the crazy things you see.

A giant talking fish lumbers past you, singing a drunken karaoke song, about how much he misses his ex-girlfriend. A man in a gas mask runs past you, with a woman in a gas mask right behind him. You both pass a giant mutant spider, with a little kid laughing and shoving a fistful of jelly beans in its web.

The two of you walk along the sidewalk, enjoying the nightlife district, when you suddenly notice a short, purple-haired young woman with a large stick coming towards you.

You stop and turn around, to see what she's looking at, and see the giant mutant spider, which is now walking towards her.

She says ""Hey! You! Stop there!""
You turn back around and start walking again, when you hear her shout, ""Hey! Stop right there!""

You turn around again, and see the young woman with the stick, running up to you. She is pointing the stick at the giant mutant spider, and shouting at it.

""You stop right there, you monster! Don't you know some people can't control you, you vicious beast?""

The spider pauses, and looks at her with its large yellow eyes. It lets out a low rumbling growl.
""You are in so much trouble, young lady!"" the spider growls.

The young woman takes a few steps backwards, keeping the stick pointed at the spider.
""I'm not afraid of you!"" she shouts.

The spider continues to growl, but doesn't move to attack, it just continues to stare at her.

""You want some of this, you vicious monster? I'll show you how tough I am!"" the woman shouts, and then takes a deep breath and runs at full speed towards the spider.
You watch as the woman runs at the spider with the stick, the woman screaming all the way. When she gets close enough, the spider leaps at her, wrapping its giant furry body around her and knocking her to the ground, wrapping her in webbing to stop her attack, then backing away and saying “now, if we can be reasonable here, I suggest we not do anything rash, yes?""

The woman lies on the ground, covered in webbing and whimpering, as the spider continues, ""Don't worry, I won't let any harm come to you. Just stay away from me, and I won't hurt you.""

The woman screams, and then begins to cry. She says ""You're just a monster, a mutated animal! I can't even trust you not to hurt me, you're just a vicious beast!""

The spider says ""I’m not the one running at someone with a stick…”

The woman looks up at the large creature, and says, ""You? You're not going to hurt me?""

The spider says ""No. I'm not going to hurt you.""
The woman looks terrified, and says ""You promise?""
The spider says ""I promise.""
The woman sighs, and then says ""Okay, fine. I give up. I give in. I surrender. You win.""

Cara and I look at each other as we watch the conversation between the spider and the purple haired woman, and then look at each other again as the woman continues to speak. 

""I surrender to you, beast. I give you my freedom. You win.""

The woman slowly raises her hands, and lets her arms fall to her sides. She sighs, and says ""Okay, fine. I'll go wherever you want me to go.""

The spider says ""Excellent. I think you'll be happy with where you end up, though. Now, come with me.""","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2023-02-15-172831","1676478511","None","1676478725.0","0","j8nfniu","False","t3_112s98o","False","t1_j8nfniu","False","t3_112s98o","/r/AIDungeon/comments/112s98o/i_just_started_using_ai_dungeon_is_this_a_normal/j8nfniu/","1678208080","10","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None"

That constitutes plagiarism all by itself, because they did nothing to contribute to the OC nor anything to do to define them.

As well, legally, they're obligated to grant you royalties for their promoting or benefitting as a result of your work.

The simpler answer is that they can't. You're not using THEIR platform to spread hate crimes or plot some sad-sack shit, are you? Then they can't stop you for fulfilling the purpose of their platform. But they cannot own you and your entire family as a result. They reserve the right to ban you, sure, if you try to defame them.

One story had him climb through a window and look at the writer/me... Kinda creepy response I got to. Almost like he really is 4th wall breaking as he threatens addressing me as human. 




Anyone had any crazy female characters in stories just like pop up and kill or save everyone. Maybe named Jane, Mihrab, Larissa McCalpin (cpt mcCalpin) or Kira. 


Or

 randomly have some character get possessed and go crazy in an otherwise non supernatural story....


Read one story where it seemed like one of my characters just stepped in possessed them and murdered everyone.....


Jane might be able to jump between stories. I'm not sure.


 Demon queen or former demon queen and possible warrior of God depending on which universe and stage in development she is in. If she does jump between people's stories her state might be random and she's destroyed the entire planet several times in her past so....

Suppose you create a World Info entry for Parn the human fighter, that alone won't cause him to show up. However if the name gets brought up in some form that makes him or someone like him more likely to appear. If you start asking for Parn or you have a statement in your pin about Parn, he will start coming up in responses. Also for NPCs that are sure to only be in one spot you can mention them in the World Info for a Location and that possibly makes them show up there when the location is brought up.

Personalities are usually close to how you describe them in World Info but be warned the AI gets confused dealing with multiple NPCs and will start getting their details mixed up. i.e. if Parn and Deedlit are both in the AI's memory, the AI might respond saying that Parn is a blonde haired elf.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2023-02-17-090639","1676621199","None","False","0","j8vr6bh","False","t3_113iu5o","False","t1_j8vr6bh","True","t3_113iu5o","/r/AIDungeon/comments/113iu5o/npcs/j8vr6bh/","1678198078","1","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None"

If you're into telling stories sudowrite is definitely better than either.

That's why, even though I have a $15 AID subscription, I have not been using it much in over half a month.  
Novel, on the other hand, has weaker AI and a higher price tag, but I like it's text richness, plus it has tools or customizations that AID doesn't have, which gives you more flexibility. So, if price aside I would choose Novel.  
But, in case you want to do a text adventure without porn - CharacterAI might even be a better option than this two.

Of two young souls who did in passion thrust?

Of sweetest coitus, whose delights untold,

Doth set the blood afire and make the heart unfold?

Forsooth, the gentle maid and gallant knight

Did meet beneath the stars' romantic light…

And there did share a kiss so sweet and rare,

That all the world seemed lost in their embrace so fair.

And then, with boldness born of truest love,

The knight didst lift his lady like a dove

And carry her unto a secret grove,

Where none but they might taste of passion's trove.

There, midst the leaves and whispering breeze,

The knight didst take his lady to her knees.

With a gentleness so pure of mind,

He didst make her feel like the most blessed of womankind.

For in that moment, they didst become as one,

Their hearts and bodies fused in harmony's sun.

And from that union came a love so true

That not the gods themselves could tear them two.

Oh, how they writhed and moaned in sweetest bliss,

Their bodies joined in perfect tenderness.

As if each kiss and touch didst cause a spark,

And set their love aflame like a glowing ark.

And so, my friends, if e'er you feel the need

To seek out love and pleasure's sweetest seed,

Remember this tale of the knight and maid,

And know that true love doth never fade.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2023-02-20-033929","1676860769","None","False","0","j98p691","False","t3_116rzbe","False","t1_j98p691","False","t1_j98840x","/r/AIDungeon/comments/116rzbe/the_ai_genuinely_sounds_like_shakespeare_doing/j98p691/","1678182402","94","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None"

ACT III, SCENE II
[Enter Romeo and Juliet]
JULIET: Oh Romeo, thy presence doth ignite A flame within me, burning bright. My heart doth beat in frantic pace, And every breath I take is filled with grace.
ROMEO: Fair Juliet, thy beauty doth surpass The brightest star in heaven's vast. Thy eyes, thy lips, thy every feature, Doth stir within me an insatiable creature.
[They embrace passionately]
JULIET: Oh Romeo, I am lost in thee, A prisoner of thy sweet company. Take me, love, and make me thine, For I am wholly and forever thine.
ROMEO: My dearest Juliet, my heart's desire, Let us yield to passion's fire. Together we shall ride the waves of love, And soar as high as the heavens above.
[They kiss fervently]
JULIET: Oh, Romeo, thy touch doth set My soul aflame, with no regret. In thy arms, I find sweet release, A joy that doth my heart increase.
ROMEO: Juliet, my love, with thee I'll stay, Until the stars doth fade away. Our bodies entwined in sweet embrace, A love that time shall not erase.
[They fall onto the bed, their bodies intertwined in ecstasy]
JULIET: Oh Romeo, my heart doth burst With love for thee, my soul's first. In thy arms, I find my true home, A place where love and passion doth roam.
ROMEO: Juliet, my love, with thee I'll dwell, In passion's embrace, our hearts to swell. Together we'll ride the tide of love, A bond that shall forever prove.
[They continue to make love, their bodies writhing in ecstasy as the scene fades to black.]","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2023-02-20-091301","1676880781","None","False","0","j99l9k8","False","t3_116rzbe","False","t1_j99l9k8","False","t3_116rzbe","/r/AIDungeon/comments/116rzbe/the_ai_genuinely_sounds_like_shakespeare_doing/j99l9k8/","1678181360","11","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None"

It wasn't just steering away from ""flagable"" actions, but it wouldn't allow flirting, deception, or much of anything that wasn't strictly PG. Just telling a shopkeeper they were pretty was resulting in being attacked or guards being called over and over, almost without fail, the best case was that they became antagonistic and either refused to do business or jacked up prices. Approaches ranged from upfront to subtle and letting the AI describe the action. Trying to deceive a guard was similarly nigh impossible.

We'll provide feedback to the team about this response and apologize that it was misleading.  


We've been putting more effort into being clear and careful around making changes to the AI and communicating those changes to players. You can see a recent article we wrote about that here: [https://latitude.io/blog/ai-model-management](https://latitude.io/blog/ai-model-management). We have more work to do so that when you have issues like the ones you experienced, you can check the AI version and see if recent changes could be the culprit.

&amp;#x200B;

If you look at the change log for the AI, there haven't been any changes made to the AI recently. We DO get feedback like this quite a bit though. Sometimes players say, ""The AI has been weird lately"" or even ""The AI has been awesome recently!"" but we hear this whether there's been a recent model change or not. If you hang out on our Discord server, you see things like this almost weekly. This is why we've implemented a rigid version system for the AI so players can know whether for sure the AI has changed.  


The realm of possibility with the AI is still so wide that it's totally possible to have a couple bad sessions in a row, and then have several great ones. We encourage players to turn on ""Improve the AI"" and use the feedback tools (thumbs up/down) or submitting AI feedback. This helps us identify any AI issues and make changes to address them.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2023-02-22-184429","1677087869","None","False","0","j9kldns","False","t3_118orvw","False","t1_j9kldns","False","t3_118orvw","/r/AIDungeon/comments/118orvw/concerning_the_bad_actions_lately/j9kldns/","1678168620","15","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None"

I do not remember if after the installation you are required to create an account or if akin to the site you can play without one (progress not being saved if so), but either way, it should not be a problem.

I have not tried character.ai, but if I recall correctly it is kind of a chatbot. AIDungeon instead is more of a storytelling AI than a one to one chat, and though it probably could be used like one, expect the AI to make mistakes recognizing who is talking, aside of others such as forgetting details or saying bizarre things.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2023-02-28-213144","1677616304","None","False","0","jaead2i","False","t3_11ecbgs","False","t1_jaead2i","True","t3_11ecbgs","/r/AIDungeon/comments/11ecbgs/cant_get_into_the_supposed_site_due_to_captcha/jaead2i/","1678133500","2","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None"
