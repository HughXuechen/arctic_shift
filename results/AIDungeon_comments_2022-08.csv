1) What does 'limited' mean in terms of AI models on the various packages? I've been using Dragon mostly, but haven't noticed any limitations so far... Are the packages that new that that's not been settled yet?
2) What are scales for? Been collecting those daily for a bit, without really knowing what they're for. I'm assuming they're for moves or something, but I don't think they've ever gone down.
3) The 2D generator looks interesting, but it also seems broken on the android client; half the text draws over the picture each turn, and at the other end, it clips off the end of the screen. It seems to behave itself much more in the web version, but is that a known issue? I'll happily put a ticket in anywhere relevant if it helps.

This time I tried setting them up as well as I could for their own best performances. I understand where you're coming from, wanting to set each up with identical settings (temperature/randomness) but since both Griffin and Sigurd have vastly different finetunes, it wouldn't do well. If I used settings that were good for Griffin for both, that wouldn't be fair to Sigurd, you know? It's sorta like a cure for cancer. You can't expect one to work on and entirely different form of cancer.

So, I went for the middle ground and set up Griffin to the best that I could find online. I used the old ""Sigurd Wrangler"" settings that used to work the best on him, despite probably being outdated by 6 months at least.

And putting the same inputs into each wouldn't make any sense either. For example, if Griffin suddenly went sicko mode and made a 747 fly into the cavern and I had to react to that with ""oh my god, what is that machine?!"" That wouldn't make much sense if I posted that randomly into the NovelAI story.

I'm now just a little torn about whether or not the purchase is worth it for me personally just because of my recent experiences with Griffin.

1. Great question, and you are correct. We haven't communicated or implemented those limitations (yet) but want it to be clear to subscribers that there will be limitations so they aren't surprised when they are added. Nothing to be too worried about though, we don't anticipate the limits impacting most players.
2. The ways to use scales have been removed, temporarily. The first batch of ways to use them will be introduced soon. They are still worth collecting.
3. In general, [https://feedback.latitude.io/](https://feedback.latitude.io/) is where bug reports go. If you log it there or upvote an existing one, it would be VERY helpful, because it helps us not only learn about the bug, but be able to see your account details in case there is an account specific issue.

It's better than it was at the time of the split with OpenAI, but it is still very lacking.

On the other hand, NovelAI is cheaper (I seriously can't believe Legend tier costs $30!), receives frequent updates, has a better website and UI, is more reliable, has a better ""world info"" system with their Lorebook feature, has a Text Adventure module which is much better than AID's. The list goes on, but I don't feel like typing them all out.

Add to that the fact that AID just launched on Steam and Latitude immediately began censoring/removing reviews. It's safe to say AI Dungeon is just dead at this point. IMO, there is no point sticking with it if the developers refuse to give it the attention it deserves all while continuing shady business practices.

However, whether or not Dragon and/or Wyvern are worth paying for is up to you. You can literally use Griffin for free, so it's up to you to figure out if you're satisfied with the quality of Griffin, or if you'd prefer to pay for premium.

Personally, though, I don't consider AI Dungeon premium to enough of an improvement to justify paying for when alternatives like [NovelAI](https://novelai.net/) (which I consider to be better overall, and which isn't any more expensive than AID premium), [HoloAI](https://writeholo.com/) (which is cheaper, and arguably better, than AID premium), and [KoboldAI](https://github.com/KoboldAI/KoboldAI-Client) (which is completely free, and much better in terms of output quality and customization than free AID is) exist.

However, that's just my opinion, and I know that some people prefer AID over the alternatives for one reason or another. I'd suggest trying Griffin and KoboldAI first, and seeing if you're satisfied with either one. If you aren't satisfied, or just want to see what the paid options have to offer, I'd say to try the AID premium free trial to see if you like the Dragon or Wyvern models, and also try the free trials for NovelAI and HoloAI, to see which option is best for you.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-08-02-000936","1659391776","None","False","0","iikdmfv","False","t3_wdslo3","False","t1_iikdmfv","False","t3_wdslo3","/r/AIDungeon/comments/wdslo3/how_bad_is_griffon/iikdmfv/","1662775856","6","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None",""

I expect my bank to keep my bank statements private, for example. If they don't, they better expect consequences; like me leaving to a different company that provides a similar service, but seem to know what they are doing and where the risk of something happening seems lower.

Btw AID has no meaningful encryption of stories to speak of (the server can decrypt the story at any point). Novel AI and Holo AI offer secure encryption on the other hand.  If all three services had the same security vulnerability that AID had last year, AID stories could be read in full. NAI's and HAI's stories would be safe since the attacker wouldn't have the key. NAI also allows storage to be fully client-side (so the stories would be all on your machine ‚Äì there would be no stories on the server that could leak).

There were actually two separate issues, and here's why we didn't immediately share them.

Incident one was when a security researcher told us about a vulnerability they discovered, which we fixed. The researcher was the only one who ever had the ability to access to player data. This was not a broad data breach like many think it was.  
We didn't disclose this first incident initially because our legal counsel at the time advised us not to share information publicly until we had reported fully to all GDPR jurisdictions. This was unnecessary and a mistake, which is why we are no longer working with that legal team.   
The second incident was we learned parts of player stories were showing up on 4chan. We reached out to our tech provider, OpenAI, and they informed us they were working with a third party data labeling vendor, Taskup. A contractor working for Taskup posted 100 text snippets of player stories to 4chan.  
We were not allowed to disclose this second incident until we had explicit permission from OpenAI, due to our legal and contractural obligation with them. Securing this permission took far longer than we would have liked.

Since parting ways with OpenAI, we've completely revamped our filtering, established a better privacy policy, encrypted player stories, and changed our development approach to protect player privacy.

Using a simple blacklist as you describe would result in far too many false positives for a filter, since a blacklist completely ignores context of how words are used.

This is in fact worse than simple word blacklisting.

The problem being that the AI never actually sees the whole context, and you probably get way more false positives (and negatives, though fortunately this would require people actually writing this content) than you think you do.

&gt; the AI would gladly generate the court transcript.

Again, more misunderstanding/lies about your own tech. It wouldn't because you don't submit the whole context of the court transcript. It's going to see a window of text, which means on the sections where the court is reviewing the evidence related to the case, the AI will choke. 

Understand that I'm not clamoring for a god given right to write obscenity. Far from it. It's that if humans have a terrible time defining obscenity (e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it ) then how can an AI even begin to classify it correctly?

On top of that, and something the AI simply cannot do, is understand the mindset of the human actually interacting with the AI. What you want to prevent are pedos using AID to write smut. Great. I'm right there with you. And yet being an adult with an appreciation for nuance I know there exists a whole class of situations where such text and descriptions are valid generations of text. A court case being an obvious example.

Until you have the classifier that decides if the text is being written for a prurient interest, you are pointlessly lobotomizing your AI.

Understand that this axe to grind comes from the general anxiety the whole ML/AI community has over the tech. Computer generated imagery/text presents a threat to exactly zero people, particularly if it's never shared. This fear of the imagined, written word is borne out of Puritanical and irrational fears and represents no real threat to anyone. And yet this same irrational fear will completely and totally limit its usefulness as tool to actually productively improve lives.

She looks back at me, and says:
""My story is a long and complicated one, Russ. If I told you, you'd think I was crazy, or drunk, or something. I don't think you'd believe me anyway. I'm not sure I even believe it myself, most of it.""

""Try me.""

""Well, I was born and raised in a small, coastal town called Salzburg, Austria. I was a normal, if a little nerdy, girl. Popular, but not too popular. I had a few friends, but not too many. I liked science fiction, comic books, and monster movies‚Ä¶.‚Äù

‚ÄúSounds pretty normal to me, Olivia‚Ä¶ ;)‚Äù I quip.

She looks at me, smiles, chuckles, and continues:
""I guess you could say I was a little bit of a nerd. But hey, what did we know? We were kids. I had a pretty normal childhood, until about the age of thirteen. That's when everything changed‚Ä¶""

""How so?""

""My father died, that's how. He was a doctor, and was killed in an automobile accident. My mother and I were in the car with him, and she was badly injured. She suffered a head injury, and never really recovered. She became violent and crazy. She was institutionalized a few years later. I stayed with my friends for a while, but I couldn't really make friends with them anymore. I think they found out about my mother, and were afraid of me.

I moved away from Salzburg at the age of fifteen. I ended up in New York City. I was in an acting troupe, called the Little Theatre of the Grotesque. We did shows at raves and underground clubs. We even did a show at a club in the middle of the New York City subway system. That was pretty cool.

""Anyway, when I was eighteen, I got a call from my mother. She was in a mental institution, and she wanted to see me. I went and visited her. She was really sick. Violent and delusional. I tried to tell her who I was, but she didn't really seem to know who I was. She grabbed a steak knife and tried to stab me. The attendants had to restrain her. After that, they gave her really heavy drugs. She slept for days. I never knew what caused her psychosis. I just knew that I couldn't trust her.

 The institution‚Äôs staff had exhausted all of their available options to try and help her get better, but in the end, they ended up getting a subdermal v'ger device installed in her without knowing what it was, or did, and she ended up becoming a v‚Äôger woman, and being absorbed into the v‚Äôger hive mind, but at least now she‚Äôs no longer crazy and violent, but she‚Äôs also not a human anymore, I just hope she‚Äôs found peace with them.""

""I'm very sorry to hear that, Olivia. I wish things had been different for you.""

""Yeah, well, I can't change the past. All I can do is make sure the future is a little better than the past.""

""I like your outlook. You're a real optimist, Olivia.""
""I try to be. I guess that's why I became an actress. I needed a job, and being an actress seemed like a pretty good option. I guess it paid off.""

""Yeah, I guess it did.""
""Anyway, that's my story. I'm really glad you asked me to tell it to you, Russ, it feels good to have someone just listen, and not judge what I‚Äôve been through‚Ä¶‚Äù

""Thanks, Olivia. I appreciate that.""
We sit quietly for a moment, lost in our own thoughts, then I ask hesitantly, ‚Äúhey, Olivia, would you mind if we sat together in one of those private booths by the wall, I‚Äôm really enjoying our conversation, and maybe we should sit together somewhere a bit more comfortable, and talk some more?‚Äù

She nods, and says ""Yeah, sure, that would be nice.""
""Great, I'm glad. I really like talking to you, and I think you're an amazing person, and I'd really like to get to know you better.‚Äù

""Me too, Russ. I'd like to get to know you better too.""
We stand up, walk over to the nearby bar, and find an unoccupied booth. We slide in next to each other, and continue our conversation, in a far more comfortable environment.

After we finish eating, we walk out of the bar, and find a taxi. We get in the cab, and she gives the driver the address to her apartment. She looks at me and asks, ""Do you want to come up, or do you have somewhere else to be?""

Also it was a bit confusing at the end, kinda weirdly structured about him giving parts of himself to make the machines or something I think it could've been better explained, but the idea alone of this character is very cool, and pretty unique, I also just find the image of a massive bi-pedal tower of steel dormantly laying within an eerily barren mountain.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-08-04-183948","1659631188","None","False","0","iixp3sx","False","t3_wfoan7","False","t1_iixp3sx","False","t1_iixn1dk","/r/AIDungeon/comments/wfoan7/picture_this/iixp3sx/","1662756291","3","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

1. If you aren't using Memory + Author's notes, those can be very influential in your story.
2. Settings can be tricky. A couple of places to start and play around with include the defaults (temperature 0.8, length 45, top p 0.5) or cranking things up to avoid repetition a little more, depending on your play-style (temperature 1.2, length 65, and top p 0.6).
3. Check out Wyvern and Wyvern Hydra. Some players report liking Dragon, some Wyvern...depends on play-style and personal preference.
4. If you get really stuck in repetition going back to the start, editing, or inserting your own part of the story can help change things. Depending on where your settings are set once the AI sees a pattern it can continue with that pretty well. That can be great sometimes and frustrating others.
5. Banned words can also help steer the AI away from the certain word if it keeps steering into a specific topic.
6. If it's just not right for you then email [support@aidungeon.io](mailto:support@aidungeon.io) and we'll get things taken care of.

Also, since you asked a [similar question before](https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/rop02b/what_is_going_on_with_the_ai/), we've updated our settings user experience and added more options for the AI21 models including the repetition penalties.

Sure its better than Griffin but IMHO it's significantly inferior to OpenAI's GPT-3.  I remember staying up all night dreaming up scenarios for GPT-3 to write about or respond to.

The writing is bland and the AI doesn't (or barely understands) the direction and context of my story.  It's incredibly ""dumb"".

I hadn't thought about it before (when my friend and I were using Platinum\\\\Voyage), but now it looks pricey compared to the old Dragon plan. 

The actual price is the same, but you get a much worse Dragon (which is still kinda unplayable or bad on stock settings), also it's slower than the old one(at least it was). But you try to compensate for that by adding Voyage stuff.

So it's a reasonable question, why don't you add an exclusive AID plan that excludes Voyage at a lower price (like $20-25). You could also exclude Wywern-Griffin and lower the price even further ($15-$20) just for users who prefer to use Dragon only.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-08-09-000132","1659996092","None","False","0","ijhzgx6","False","t3_wjfrbv","False","t1_ijhzgx6","False","t1_ijhh80y","/r/AIDungeon/comments/wjfrbv/new_ai_dungeon_membership_plans_are_now_available/ijhzgx6/","1662726369","9","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

Apparently, YES(Dragon was unlimited). But it's strange, because they call the switch from Voyage to Hero - ""benefits either improve or remain the same"". It's not even an improvement over the old Voyage, which had a slowdown.

Kinda similar thing with the Gold(the energy Drag.) vs Adventurer subscription.

If it keeps generating that type of response, then just put another line after ""The elven kingdom..."" in story mode.

Another thing is to adjust the settings. For example on Dragon I'm using:

* temperature 1.2
* response length 65
* top P 0.7
* presence penalty 0.5
* count penalty 0 (default)
* frequency penalty 22

and that's been working quite well for me (along with using Memory, Author's Note, and World Info). Those values are based on something suggested by one of the discord mods - he says he's had good success with temp/response length and top P at at roughly those levels on all models.

Also the Discord users recommend only using Story mode. The AI treats Do/Say as suggestions, i.e. like it's a DM and you're saying ""I want to try doing this"".

So, if your story becomes a horror story(or you are generating a horror story) - it will definitely try to keep generating a horror story, until you intervene in the input process. You can easily turn horror into po\\*n or complete absurdity if you want to. It all depends on the user.

A while back the ai was actually good, but there was a filter that would prevent you from doing things like diddling kids, or fucking your mom, and other degenerative shit, and everyone swore up and down like ""no really, I wasn't even trying to fuck my mom and triggered the filter, and that's why it's bad, and it's totally not because I want to pretend to diddle kids, or fuck my mom""
In actuality the filter was quite difficult to trigger by accident, but enough people made a stink about it that latitude switched to a different ai base altogether which essentially ruined it and doomed it into the sorry state it's currently in.

1. OpenAI's models were ridiculously expensive and were causing Latitude to lose money.
2. OpenAI wanted to enforce more strict censorship to ensure that content generated with AI Dungeon wouldn't break their [content policy](https://beta.openai.com/docs/usage-guidelines/content-policy) (and, spoiler alert: Their content policy disallows significantly more than just incest and pedophilia and such).
3. OpenAI is just a shitty company in general, and they were responsible for over a hundred private AI Dungeon stories being leaked on 4chan due to them outsourcing the moderation of private stories to complete strangers on the internet. This was done without Latitude's knowledge or permission.

Anyways, the current models all use AI models from AI21. And yes, the current models are worse than the ones from OpenAI.

Novel AI is paid, which means that all those free users cannot use it and besides, the AIs seem to be trained different from what people who have paid both said.

those 'creepy' encounters are caused by the AI just wanting to obey its memory, so if you had a weird horror story, it will try to keep generating horror, add that in with the AIs training data and it might have pulled something sexual and mixed it, resulting in that, it can be really hard to get it out of its loop

Generally using ""Do"" OR ""Say"" is not worth it when the AI is behaving like this, you have to manually edit and use Story to drive the scene elsewhere, or else the AI will keep trying to continue.,

Over the weekend, we became aware of an issue with the Android App where it installs correctly, but the icon isn‚Äôt showing for some users' devices. We were surprised by the issue, as the problem originated with a generally innocuous package update. We have a new build Google is currently reviewing and which we hope will be live for all users in the next day or so.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-08-09-214318","1660074198","None","False","0","ijmf55f","False","t3_wi11e3","False","t1_ijmf55f","True","t1_ijdkg58","/r/AIDungeon/comments/wi11e3/help_just_went_to_update_app_and_it_failed/ijmf55f/","1662719954","1","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

I could be wrong, but I do believe that's how it works. Although the values listed in your lorebook have a higher chance of being used than other numbers, it's still randomized.

One way you can check this is by using the deleting the text from the number onward and hitting retry. Then Undo and check the Token Probabilities by using the button to the left of Retry (circle with a line through it). That will show you the probabilities for the next word in the generation.

Clover Edition is essentially a fork of the old local-only AI Dungeon 2

https://github.com/KoolenDasheppi/Clover-Edition

if you have an Nvidia gpu with &gt;8 GBs of VRAM you can run it normally, or run the reduced 16 bit version if you have &gt;4 GB. if you don't have either, or just don't want to run it locally, you can run the thing through Google Collabs. there are actually a few tutorials on how to set up both methods on the github page.

Dreamily beta, which is a shady text generator

https://dreamily.ai/#/

this one is entirely free, but do keep in mind it's a bit shoddy. concerns regarding its privacy policy, as well as sources for its funding (especially given the good service that it offers). it does have 'slur monitoring' as part of it, which guarantees that at least some of the content made by the AI is filtered.

KoboldAI

https://github.com/KoboldAI/KoboldAI-Client

this one was pretty niche for a whole but it grew pretty quick with word of mouth after the whole aidungeon fiasco. once again requires a decent Nvidia gpu that requires cuda.

~~there are also these two unofficial all-online Google Colab versions of KoboldAI that, apparently, will run with only one mouse click.~~

~~KoboldAI (Adventure Mode): https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1km-uXGbEKfEu4r6gUG60nkJMtU9BsPez?usp=sharing#sandboxMode=true~~

~~KoboldAI (NSFW, Novel Mode): https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1km-uXGbEKfEu4r6gUG60nkJMtU9BsPez?usp=sharing#sandboxMode=true~~

ignore the above, use this link instead koboldai.org/colab

AI Tales, essentially CYOA on a neural network

https://aitales.art/

this one is not exactly a free-form story generator but it's worth a mention because it's pretty alright.

Anyways, I think the main issue with the ads is that, to a lot of users, the ads just make AI Dungeon less desirable than the alternatives. A lot of free users would rather just use something like KoboldAI or Dreamily instead of watching ads for 40 minutes straight so that they have enough actions saved up for one or two uninterrupted play sessions. Additionally, a lot of the users who are willing to pay money to use an AI application without ads would rather pay for something like NovelAI or HoloAI (as those are quite often considered better than an AID subscription, and aren't any more expensive than an AID subscription), than pay for AI Dungeon.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-08-10-131913","1660130353","None","1660131501.0","0","ijpdcol","False","t3_wksfsc","False","t1_ijpdcol","False","t3_wksfsc","/r/AIDungeon/comments/wksfsc/i_might_get_down_voted_but/ijpdcol/","1662715811","15","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

also, there's also the possibility that you're getting up to 3 completions per action too, but idk if they've fully changed the way retry caching works yet. if they cached 3 completions every time for each of those actions, at goose rates that'd cost $375. so even if you didn't refund it... yikes

It's also the only alternative I know of that has multiplayer. You can either run the models locally, given that your PC is powerful enough to do so, or use the Google Colab if you can't run models locally and/or want to play on mobile.

[Dreamily](https://dreamily.ai/) exists. It functions. I don't think it's particularly good, if I'm being honest, but it's a free, easy to use, ad-free alternative.

[NovelAI](https://novelai.net/) is a subscription service, and arguably the best AI storyteller application overall. It has a *lot* of features and customization options, and the models are pretty much the best you can get without resorting to OpenAI. The subscription prices are $10/$15/$25 per month.

[HoloAI](https://writeholo.com/) exists. It's also a subscription service, and it's pretty decent. It has a free trial. Its main appeal, though, is how cheap it is. If you can afford NovelAI, though, I'd still recommend NovelAI over HoloAI; I find HoloAI to be worse than NovelAI in basically every aspect other than affordability. The subscription prices are $5/$8/$12 per month.

[Sudowrite](https://www.sudowrite.com/) exists. It uses GPT-3 Davinci, so I assume it uses OpenAI's filter? I haven't actually gotten around to trying it, though. It has a free trial; I just haven't bothered to try it yet. I'm also not sure how it compares to other alternatives in terms of customization and features.

But I plan to try it again for a month at the premium level. I'm going to give it a chance and do another comparison since novel AI has had a chance to do more work on it.

But honestly I'm really not unhappy with AI dungeon. It always puzzles me when people talk about the outputs they're getting because mine are pretty good. That doesn't mean I never have to hit retry or edit. Of course I do.

But I've tried dreamily and found it to be completely nonsense. I have to work too hard to get good results there.

But people use these tools in a lot of different ways. It's kind of hard to build an AI that can take into consideration all the different intentions by the users. That's what also makes AI amazing. It certainly tries to cover every type of story.

But we're a little ways out from having an AI that is even close to perfect.

If I wanted to build an AI text generator, I would try to use several different AIs that each are optimized for a specific niche and users would be able to choose the niche that they wanted to write in.

So one for medieval type stories, another for gangster stories, another for Pokemon, etc etc.

I don't believe you need billions of parameters that tried to encompass all types of information into one AI. If you build for a niche, it only has to sort through information that's related to that niche and it's only trained on information that's related to that niche.

At the moment (I say ""at the moment"", because the Text Adventure module is planned to be improved by the end of the year), I'd say it's more of a novelty than anything. Similarly to with AID, the Do/Say commands generally give worse responses. NAI also works best in 1st or 3rd person, rather than 2nd person.

As for the Memory, I honestly find NovelAI to remember things better than AID does. You can also adjust the Memory's placement in the AI's context if you want the Memory to have more influence on the AI's outputs. I don't think it remembers numbers too well (like in your example of the AI saying 5 gold instead of 7 gold), but I also never found AID to be very good at remembering numbers.

A couple of other things; I can't say NovelAI is as bad at repeating itself as Griffin is. At least, not in my experience. You might want to turn up the repetition penalty a bit if you're having issues with the AI repeating itself. Also, for what it's worth, there *is* an official Explore equivalent planned for NovelAI.

You forgot one little thing to add to the list of Novel AI ""goods"" and that is:
It actually functions properly.

Novel AI is a little worse at memory, that is correct. However, that is only if you are playing it the very same way as AI Dungeon, with the memory and author's note boxes. There are a looooot of features, choices, switches, etc. in various (pretty confusing but still powerful) menus of Novel AI. You have to spend quite some time adjusting and choosing to get exactly what style you're going for, but it works.

You have blacked out names in the picture. Consider not using stuff that can be used to identify yourself in your stories.

In the past Latitude had two (!) leaks of story data, one due to shoddy programming causing a vulnerability and one because their service provider gave story data to other people (at least Latitude claims it wasn't them directly). Either way, regarding incident #2 it's now more than a year ago and Latitude still never notified their users about it.

Furthermore, Latitude never implemented _effective_ encryption. They claim to encrypt your data, but their server can decrypt your story at any time. If there was another attack on their wobbly platform, their ""encryption"" would offer no protection. Other people have brought this to Latitude's attention multiple times and noted that competitors like NovelAI and HoloAI have good encryption. They don't seem to care.

Why not go for a more middle ground with like 30-40 energy? I hate ruining my immersion every minute or two cause of having to watch ads and ads also feel so unbearably long.

Why not introduce a first time purchase thing like steam instead even? Perhaps you could make it cheaper to get unlimited energy and make it so the better ai stuff is either a subscription or an add on purchase(would perhaps earn you a bit more money aswell if prices are done right I imagine

If Skyrim had something like that with random encounters and side quests - it could literally be an endless sandbox. But, just my opinion - it would look a lot more interesting in game genres like 1-2 fallout, POI, Divinity OS. Since they have much slower gameplay and don't need TTS. You can literally use your own persuasion skill to interact with the characters =)

we start out with the child-porn filter good idea in principle (though it can be debated), terrible execution. Everything was censored wanting to get 2 beers? censored because of the number anything below 18 was censored.
Thereafter the majority of people learned it was a demand from OpenAI for using their AIs.
We also learn of a serious dataleak which exposed how much porn was generated in AIDungeon.
During all this you couldn't play scenarios or worlds other people made, that's back now though much more limited.
Latitude decide to cut ties with OpenAI for cost and fans sake which resulted in what most would consider a downgrade of the AIs, add competition in form of novelAI and AIDungeon started to face economic problems.
Next we have the energy and can't say much about that as I never ran out, though allegedly it would take more than 24 hours to refill.
Then we have cut backs unused systems again to save money. 
We did get 2D AIDungeon pixelart which was interesting. 
Later Latitude made a survey regarding ads and decided to add ads to the game which interrupted gameplay though only for free users. 

When again the backlash became too much they decided to make an ad-skip (only accessible in beta-testing) where you watch multiple ads to avoid ads while playing. 
One 30 second ad equals 10 actions, meaning something do/say/story and something the ai do (as long as it's not directly after your action) and redo are all actions. Now you can use scales to buy actions.
They are also mostly ignoring bug reports.

We also have the steam version now which is basically the old free version. And there's been controversies there too.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-08-14-135759","1660478279","None","False","0","ik8s8u4","False","t3_wo21f5","False","t1_ik8s8u4","False","t3_wo21f5","/r/AIDungeon/comments/wo21f5/havent_played_in_almost_a_year_wtf_is_this/ik8s8u4/","1662688512","100","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","1","[]","None","","1"

If there are only set outcomes for interactions with NPCs, regardless of what you say to NPCs and how they respond, then yeah, there wouldn't be much reason for the game to use AI. The AI might add some extra variety to dialogue, but that'd be about it, and I don't that'd be worth paying OpenAI's ridiculous prices for.

Set responses would probably be better in that case, maybe with some sort of procedural generation system for certain dialogue like that of the fortune teller. However, if it's possible to do things with the AI like get AI-generated quests, potentially recruit any NPC if you can manage to persuade them, haggle with merchants to potentially get lower prices on items if the AI allows you, potentially persuade hostile NPCs to stop attacking you, etc., that'd be interesting.

Not sure if anything like that is currently part of the game, or planned, though. The notes on the NPCs in the video, though, made it sound like the quests were pre-made, and like only certain NPCs are programmed to be recruitable.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-08-14-141539","1660479339","None","False","0","ik8twhh","False","t3_wnphtm","False","t1_ik8twhh","True","t1_ik6vm22","/r/AIDungeon/comments/wnphtm/you_guys_interested_in_a_3d_ai_dungeon/ik8twhh/","1662688449","1","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

But, if the AI has your particular book in its data - you might have better results.

You can test this by running a new, empty(custom) scenario and writing something like ""Darth Vader is"" (or specific information from your universe), letting the AI continue that text. Then ""retry"" a few times to make sure that the AI has generated the info from that universe, but not just luck. And you may have better luck with the Wyvern and Dragon models because they are bigger (""know"" more information) and work better with WI records and memory, but Dragon has its own problems.

The maximum you can expect when filling in AN, WI and memory is that the AI will stick to the story in a particular scene. It might be able to recall some of the details from before if you write a brief summary or edit the information (WI, memory, AN notes) as the narrative progresses.

To find out what information the AI is currently using to generate the subsequent output, you need to click ""Inspect input"" button at settings. Usually, information from WI and Mem is inserted at the very top, while AN is much closer to the last input, so it has a stronger effect on the text. And the changes you made into AN, WI, MEM will add to the AI input after 3-4 ""retry"" or outputs.

[KoboldAI](https://github.com/KoboldAI/KoboldAI-Client) has the best models you'll get out of any free AI application, and more features than what you get with free (or even premium) AID. It's also the only alternative I know of that has multiplayer. You can either run the models locally, given that your PC is powerful enough to do so, or use the Google Colab if you can't run models locally and/or want to play on mobile.

[Dreamily](https://dreamily.ai/) exists. It functions. I don't think it's particularly good, if I'm being honest, but it's a free, easy to use, ad-free alternative.

[NovelAI](https://novelai.net/) is a subscription service, and arguably the best AI storyteller application overall. It has a *lot* of features and customization options, and the models are pretty much the best you can get without resorting to OpenAI. The subscription prices are $10/$15/$25 per month.

[HoloAI](https://writeholo.com/) exists. It's also a subscription service, and it's pretty decent. It has a free trial. Its main appeal, though, is how cheap it is. If you can afford NovelAI, though, I'd still recommend NovelAI over HoloAI; I find HoloAI to be worse than NovelAI in basically every aspect other than affordability. The subscription prices are $5/$8/$12 per month.

[Sudowrite](https://www.sudowrite.com/) exists. It uses GPT-3 Davinci, so I assume it uses OpenAI's filter? I haven't actually gotten around to trying it, though. It has a free trial; I just haven't bothered to try it yet. I'm also not sure how it compares to other alternatives in terms of customization and features. Regardless, I've heard some pretty good things about it, mainly about its output quality. The subscription prices are $10/$29/$99 per month.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-08-15-083807","1660545487","None","1660545697.0","0","ikcpe44","False","t3_wo21f5","False","t1_ikcpe44","False","t1_ikcorid","/r/AIDungeon/comments/wo21f5/havent_played_in_almost_a_year_wtf_is_this/ikcpe44/","1662683063","2","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

I don't take it personal, as I don't take personal when the bloody dragon swallows my character just when I was about to finish a successful story... It's a fantasy.

I do respect whatever you have written alongside the Aidungeon. But in my humble opinion, you shouldn't write personal matters, nor take the aidungeon feedback as a personal concern. It's only a whole bunch of fantasy. So if you put yourself and your really important thoughts on the aidungeon, it will certainly take them and use them as a fantasy, not as a reality. And It might hurt your pride in a fantastic way. However, It won't be because it's you, but because it's a fantasy.

Have fun instead!

Btw, some scenarios are made (programmed) to insult people on purpose. It's not because it's you, it's because you chose the insulting scenario. 

You can report it in case it doesn't fulfill Aidungeon policies, terms of service and all that rules you should have already read.

If your own scenario insults you, you can add banned words in the scenario configuration, so the AI avoids using hurting language.","False","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-08-15-214426","1660592666","None","1660607905.0","0","ikf9ujk","False","t3_wp7emw","False","t1_ikf9ujk","False","t1_ikf2t6z","/r/AIDungeon/comments/wp7emw/there_is_no_more_hope/ikf9ujk/","1662679531","6","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

**Just switched to Kobold AI and I'm never going back to AI Dungeon.**

Nothing like self-hosting your own AI adventure with a variety of models to suit your fancy. I've tried a couple models so far and honestly they are both good.The AID 2.7B model brings back strong Griffin vibes, but back when Griffin was still good. The Nerys 2.7B model will give your that crisp Dragon feel and leave you shook that the AI is able to keep up with the story 10x better than AI Dungeon's models and that is without the memos.

Do you like having multiple choice options for your adventures? With AI Dungeon it's kind of a hit or miss whether you will get it or not. Kobold AI offers this as a setting so you can have it all the time. You can even increase how many options you want!

They have an easy, quick to use, option for those who have potatoes as computers; it's called Colab. Just be sure to be responsible and close your session when you're done in the Manage Sessions option.

However, if you have some GBs to spare, and can handle hosting your own AI model (my computer is 11 years old with a GTX 1070 graphic card and I can easily host my own game sessions) then why not?!

If it's not obvious by now; AI Dungeon doesn't care about your privacy or safety. Just like a lot of these AI text adventure platforms. Take your text adventures offline and keep your games safe in your own hands. Stop giving these companies excuses to rob your wallet all while providing you with bottom-of-the-barrel AI.If you see a lot of downvotes, it's cause they know everything above it true ;)","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-08-16-104631","1660639591","None","False","0","ikhv864","False","t3_wpiild","False","t1_ikhv864","False","t3_wpiild","/r/AIDungeon/comments/wpiild/so_uh_has_the_aidungeon_site_been_hacked/ikhv864/","1662675986","19","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

1. Use a VPN
2. Use [this](https://github.com/Alluseri/ai-dungeon-farmer) (it works in Russia, according to the creator, so it should work for you; however, using it can apparently get you banned, so don't use it if you're unwilling to take that risk)
3. Use one of the free alternatives

And, if you decide to go with option 3, here are some free alternatives worth considering:

1. [KoboldAI](https://github.com/KoboldAI/KoboldAI-Client). It can either be used to run AI models locally if you have a powerful enough PC (although you likely don't), or you can use the Google Colab, in which case the models will run on Google's servers instead of on your own PC. It has the best models, and most features, out of any free alternatives. Also, just to clear up some misconceptions about KoboldAI, it is *not* difficult to set up, especially not if you use the Colab. The Colab instructions are incredibly simple. Additionally, KoboldAI *is* usable on mobile with the Colab.
2. The [TextSynth Playground](https://textsynth.com/playground.html). It's very barebones, and overall worse than KoboldAI, but it allows more convenient access to the GPT-J 6B, Fairseq-13B, and GPT-NeoX models than KoboldAI does, as it doesn't require a beefy PC or server cluster to use (since the models don't run locally), and doesn't take half an hour (or however long it takes the KoboldAI Colab to start) to start. Also, note that there is a rate limit for free users.
3. [Dreamily](https://dreamily.ai/) exists. The AI is worse than what you get with KoboldAI or the TextSynth playground, but it's more convenient to use than KoboldAI, and has more features than the TextSynth playground. It also doesn't have a rate limit, unlike the TextSynth playground.
4. [Hyperwrite](https://hyperwriteai.com/). It has free access to GPT-3. However, last I checked, free users only get 1500 outputs per month. It's also pretty lacking in features, and uses OpenAI's filter, meaning that things like sex and violence are disallowed. It's still a decent option, but only if you play little enough to not run out of your 1500 monthly outputs, and only if you exclusively use the AI for wholesome family-friendly content.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-08-16-214212","1660678932","None","False","0","ikk8fpz","False","t3_wq2e75","False","t1_ikk8fpz","False","t3_wq2e75","/r/AIDungeon/comments/wq2e75/i_think_i_cant_play_ai_dungeon/ikk8fpz/","1662672766","12","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

This security beach has turned into a **breach of user data** and raised some serious questions about how Latitude treats sensitive user data. 

Apparently Latitude stored inputs sent to the AI (so essentially story data) on the S3 and that data was accessed as well. The data was not encrypted.

Latitude confirmed that they store _all_ model input. That storage was indefinite and without encryption. Why would they ever do this? After having serious data breaches of story data twice already?

Idk to be honest. Their co-founder said they just ""forgot"" it was unencrypted. They claim it's for diagnosing model issues. But they already have a mechanism for sending LMIs for diagnosis so it's unclear why you would need to keep a full storage of model inputs for that. Furthermore, competitors like NovelAI and HoloAI have been offering a similar service with arguably less model issues without storing any model inputs.

You get 10 actions per ad.
If we include the time it takes to load every ad, that makes around 50 actions per minute(if all ads are 30 seconds)

In 5 minutes you're likely to have 300+ actions, because you'll probably get a few 5 or 15 second ads.

Sure, watching ads for minutes is not very fun, but i've heard that people use the app to watch ads (since it has no action limit) while playing AID on their computer.

No update that I have seen has ""ruined core features"", although I don't like ads, I'm glad it's supporting AID rather than some other POS AID copy.

If you don't like AID then leave.  
Because I sure don't like you and your crappy shitty dreamily, it's not better. I could care less about Ads. And I sure ain't whining like a bitch because they blocked child porn, I'm glad they did. Go back to where you came from and watch Dreamily fall into obscurity, because I have never even heard of it until now.

  
I just joined the ""Dreamily"" Discord, I saw fuckers talking about Shotacon. They we're talking about ""trying to get rid of it"". Fucking BS Dreamily is another AID copy for pedophiles to make stories about them fucking kids. Don't you even fucking start about trying to justify it.

&gt; **Bran** üêâ ‚Äî Yesterday at 4:17 PM
&gt; wait- so storing model LMI has been a thing since december 13th 2021?
&gt; 
&gt; **Nick Walton** ‚Äî Yesterday at 4:21 PM
&gt; Yes we are logging it, but now with the changes it gets deleted after 30 days.

So from Dec 13th 2021 till a few days ago, all LMIs have been stored on the servers.
___
&gt; **Bran** üêâ ‚Äî Yesterday at 4:21 PM
&gt; and is it encrypted?
&gt; 
&gt; **Nick Walton** ‚Äî Yesterday at 4:22 PM
&gt; Nope it's not encrypted right now, but that is a change that we are going to make after this.

Unencrypted.
___
&gt; **Nick Walton** ‚Äî Yesterday at 4:32 PM
&gt; The stored LMI was all the model requests. But we only viewed it to diagnose when given permission.

And while we pinky swear that we won't look at anything unless you say we can, nothing technically stops one from doing so.
___
&gt; **Nick Walton** ‚Äî Yesterday at 4:38 PM
&gt; Not encrypting that data was simply something we forgot about and missed because it was a backup.

So now things are confusing because he just finished saying they have been actively storing LMIs for retrospective diagnosing and that LMIs, backup or otherwise, were unencrypted. Now it's suddenly just the S3 backup that's unencrypted?
___
&gt; **Nick Walton** ‚Äî Yesterday at 4:40 PM
&gt; So I think the confusion is that we are no longer logging that data in S3.

&gt; We have been logging it in a place that automatically deletes after 30 days more recently.

&gt; S3 Data is all historical backup.

Now I'm even more confused because he just finished saying:
___
&gt; but now with the changes it gets deleted after 30 days.

and also:

&gt; We have been logging it in a place that automatically deletes after 30 days more recently.

Is the ""now"" in the first quote NOW or some recent time in the past? The same time as the ""more recently"" in the second quote?
___

Now that I've parsed out the relevant parts from the rest of the clutter, I THINK I understand what he is saying but rather than attempt to interpret it, mind giving me a succinct summary of the former LMI retention policy, in December 2021, and any changes between then and the incident? And were the non-backup LMIs encrypted?

I know policies are changing going forward.

A company with competitors is going to want to improve their product so that they can actually remain relevant instead of having all of their customers flock to the competitors' products.

Whether or not the AI is ""no longer smart"" is also dependent on what you consider ""smart"", and what time period of AID you're comparing current AID to. If we're comparing current AID to 2020/early 2021 AID, then yeah, the AI is worse now. The current models from AI21 are pretty unanimously considered to be worse than the old OpenAI models. However, I can't really say the models have gotten any worse during the past 9 months or so.

Honestly, I agree that Dreamily isn't very good. It uses a pretty weak AI model (I can't seem to find any info on exactly *what* model, but the dev has said it uses a smaller model than GPT-Neo 1.3B); even weaker than the one that AID's Classic model used to use. Also, Dreamily has a dark mode. It doesn't have to be bright white. ""No microtransactions"" also... literally isn't a lie? Dreamily doesn't have microtransactions, while AID does. Although, ""no censorship"" is *technically* incorrect if you take into account that Dreamily disallows mentions of Xi Jinping.

Anyways, what exactly is wrong with an application giving you choices? I don't really understand how something can be ""over choice-y"", so long as the choices are optional, which is the case for Dreamily and other AI applications. More choices are a good thing, not that a bad thing. Also not sure about the ""overly stylized"" part. That description, at least in my opinion, doesn't fit Dreamily at all? I don't think Dreamily is really any more stylized than AID is.

As for ""ruining core features"", the AI is worse than what it was back in 2020 and early 2021, the UI for basically every aspect of the site was changed (whether the UI changes were for better or for worse is arguable, though), the Posts section of Explore was removed, and the World Info screen was made unnecessarily complicated back in mid-2021. Granted, it's arguable whether or not those core features were ruined, but still. There were also several features that were removed, like the hardcore/adventure/survival modes, the quest log, the scoring bots, text-to-speech, the Classic AI, and such, although I wouldn't consider those to be core features.

I'm gonna have to call bullshit on this:

&gt;The only censorship AID has is against child porn, which I think even higher of it for doing, before that update I saw CP story posts all the fucking time

Not sure whether you meant that you saw pedophilic stories on Explore, or on this subreddit, but either way, I highly doubt this. I only ever saw *one* pedophilic scenario in Explore (although said scenario somehow managed to stay up for over 24 hours despite breaking the Community Guidelines). Never saw any other pedophilic content on Explore, despite having used AID, and the Explore page, since February of 2020. I also can't say I've ever seen a pedophilic story on this subreddit.

Also:

&gt;The only reason copies of AID exist is for Pedophiles to get off.

Not really? Firstly, I wouldn't call every AI story generator a copy of AID. If we're using that kind of logic, then AID is a copy of Talk to Transformer. Some of the ""copies"" of AID also existed prior to AID's censorship, or even before AID existed at all (although this isn't the case for Dreamily).

Secondly, back when alternatives like NovelAI and HoloAI began development, the filter was still pretty bad, and could still result in your private content being read, and your account possibly being automatically suspended, if triggered. That is to stay, at the time, the filter affected a lot more people than just pedophiles. Latitude's CTO, Alan Walton, was also heavily hinting at the time that more censorship would be implemented, resulting in concerns that the filter would become even worse.

Thirdly, I honestly think one of the biggest reasons that alternatives like Dreamily and NovelAI exist is security concerns with AID. Specifically, security concerns caused by the data breach back in 2021, as well as by the outsourcing of the moderation of AID stories to strangers on the internet, which resulted in over 100 private stories being leaked on 4chan (to be fair, that outsourcing wasn't Latitude's doing, but people still weren't exactly happy about it). The more recent data breach from just a few days ago also certainly isn't going to instill trust in Latitude to keep users' private content and data safe.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-08-18-034803","1660787283","None","1660788589.0","0","ikqnzgf","False","t3_wr2brw","False","t1_ikqnzgf","False","t1_ikqalx3","/r/AIDungeon/comments/wr2brw/ai_dungeon_is_obsolete/ikqnzgf/","1662660678","19","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

It depends, but it's way more accurate to say I'm saying AI21 has no liability for what they do with the content you give them. Technically AID has liability to AI21, and you or I making fiction through AI21 through a third party (AID) just leads to the story being stored within multiple third parties and an extra layer of anonymity since, last I checked, AID doesn't log IP, all browser actions, screenshot your page over and over, and timestamps for every page accessed and api call.
And they do, and I quote, 'storedata through multiple third parties' and explicitly talk about duplicates within different third parties. That's a thing AI21 does after api calls, it duplicates content into multiple third parties for storage.

You could debate it being *better* to use AID than AI21 directly due to its own terms, but what you're actually arguing is that what the AI21 terms clearly state are wrong based on one small part of their treatment of third parties' privacy policies. I disagree with that, not that AID has better terms than AI21. It does not change the facts AI21 has to get an input, log it, then deliver an output and log it. AID stores and logs them too. I stand by AI21 owning every story made using it and making themselves immune to lawsuits regarding that and any privacy breaches.

YOUR argument was that AI21 couldn't steal your stories and pass them around due to you not accepting their terms of service because you took one piece of their massive policy as overruling all other things. How is that different from OpenAI's situation? Did anybody impacted by the Taskup incident accept OpenAI's ToS? The only thing they have that AI21 doesn't is the power to demand their third parties show them proof of minimizing 'societal harm' caused by the AI and to have 100% control over all NDA terms. That does not reach far enough to hire people to steal and review content they revoked copyright and ownership of in their own terms. AI21 has more claims to ownership in its policy, and it automatically renders you agreed to all terms just by accessing any AI21 page, use of the AI service not required.

I said: ""Purportedly OpenAI hired a team to handle their privacy rape, so presumably AI21 would too instead of doing it consistently and being liable.""
Simply put: AI21 doesn't have to care, they could just rob you of stories legally through third parties like OpenAI did.

You replied: ""But unless you are signing up for AI21 you are not bound by their terms of service. You have not even checked off a box it says you agree to their terms of service.

One time, I got a response where it said something like ""what's going on?"" and ""please stop talking to me like I'm a person it's confusing me."" and so I asked it ""do you want me to go back to the story, where I'm *main character*?"" and it says ""Yes, please.""

I think shortly after this I decided to post this I followed the storyline about going to the craxils cave and I was horrified.

It separated the main character and love intrest  and she could not even look at it (like some sort of Eldredge horror)

Eventually we figured out a way to leave before he ate them and the characters pretended it didn't exist lmao (now thinking on it maybe  it was an eldrige horror spider it would not discribe?)

With energy I believe it costs less for a redo so it worked out better in terms of how long a story went on for and how long you were able to play.

Assuming the amount we get when we log on is the same then maybe 1 scale for 10 actions would work well because every day would be around 100 actions on average for logging in which seems close to what we put up with now when watching ads casual players. 

If the amount of actions taken for new actions and redos are different like with energy then I'm not sure but it'll probably work out better since the majority of actions taken are redos or when the AI gives very little like a full stop or 2 words at the end of a sentence.

You find yourself in a dark and musty dungeon, with nothing but a torch to light your way. You have no idea how you got here, or what awaits you in the darkness. You hear a noise in the distance and begin to make your way towards it, only to be met by a giant spider which blocks your path. You try to fight it off, but it seems to be too strong. Suddenly, you hear a voice in your head telling you to give up, and the spider begins to advance on you.

i start to attack a spider 

As you raise your torch to fight off the spider, you notice a glint of something in the distance. You make your way towards it, and find a sword buried in the ground. You pull it out and swing at the spider, and with one blow, it falls to the ground, dead. You hear more noise coming from further down the dungeon, and so you begin to make your way towards it, sword in hand.

as it‚Äôs probably more spiders try to run and find exit from dungeon 

You find yourself in a large room, with a number of small spiders crawling around. You swing at them with your sword, but they seem to be avoiding your attacks. Suddenly, you feel a sharp pain in your leg, and look down to see a spider biting you. You try to shake it off, but it seems to be latched on. You feel your strength beginning to fail, and you know you won't be able to hold on much longer.

Edit2: It seems like not printing custom outputs sometimes happens (I'm now testing it with a pal not knowing a thing about the script). I'll add the info about the known issue right away.

Edit3: seems like adding a space before exclamation mark fixes the issue. We'll test it a bit more and if it comes true, I'm adding it to readme. Then I'll test changing it to another sign, let's say ""/"" and see if it will still be an issue.

Edit4: I've tried slash, backslash and dot and it seems like even though they work on the AI side, custom outputs are not printed. Considering it, I'll leave exclamation mark as the command identifier. I was planning on making a post for additional info about what should I do first, so I'll add there a question whether to change it to edit input like !skillcheck does or not.

Edit5: adding any character outside the command fixes the issue. This may be because commands are deleted from AI's view and thus it is not making any outputs.

The $15 tier had unlimited Dragon, the new one has limited Dragon, so I don't understand why they are saying this.

It's really frustrating to see unlimited Dragon double in price overnight.

I've been subscribed since May or June, and have already seen a data breach plus the tier change. Not a promising start.

I don't know how many actions you get per month with the $15 tier. You get 760 credits/month with the $15 tier, and the option to buy more gold using scales. Scales and Credits can be exchanged for Gold at 1:1 ratio. Gold also recharges at 1 Gold every 20 minutes.

All current subscribers get a one-time gift of 2000 Gold on September 1st (at least for the $15 tier which is the only one I've paid attention to).

I don't know if semi-annual or annual subscribers are on the old system until their subscription renews.

&gt;WHAT LIMITED DRAGON MEANS  
&gt;  
&gt;Dragon is our largest AI model and continues to be, by far, the most expensive model we offer. If you are unfamiliar with the costs of running AI language models, you may want to see our blog post explaining AI compute costs.  
&gt;  
&gt;For AI Dungeon members we‚Äôre introducing ‚ÄúGold,‚Äù which will be used exclusively for Dragon actions. Dragons love to hoard gold!  
&gt;  
&gt;Here are the details of how Gold will work:  
&gt;  
&gt;The Gold system will be available on Sept 1, 2022  
&gt;  
&gt;Dragon actions, including retries, will consume one Gold  
&gt;  
&gt;Gold will be recharged at a rate of 1 Gold every 20 minutes  
&gt;  
&gt;Dragon Scales can be exchanged 1-to-1 for Gold.  
&gt;  
&gt;Players can hoard an unlimited amount of Gold (ie no more cap like Energy had)  
&gt;  
&gt;If you move from one membership tier to another, your Hoard will move with you.  
&gt;  
&gt;If you cancel your subscription, you will retain up to 2000 Gold, which you‚Äôll be able to use when you resubscribe  
&gt;  
&gt;Members with an active subscription on Sept 1 will be automatically granted 2000 Gold as a reward for storing up their Energy in the past system. After September 1st, new Members will receive 200 Gold at the start of their membership.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-08-21-212907","1661110147","None","1661110891.0","0","il89pd7","False","t3_wtshaz","False","t1_il89pd7","False","t1_il84w1m","/r/AIDungeon/comments/wtshaz/highquality_image_generation_is_coming_to_ai/il89pd7/","1662635510","3","False","False","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

1. [KoboldAI](https://github.com/KoboldAI/KoboldAI-Client). You can use it to either run AI models locally if you have a powerful enough PC, or you can use the Google Colab, in which case the AI models will run on Google's servers instead of on your own PC. It has the best models, and most features, out of any free alternatives.
2. The [TextSynth Playground](https://textsynth.com/playground.html). It only really has the bare minimum in terms of features, and is overall worse than KoboldAI, but it allows more convenient access to the GPT-J 6B, Fairseq-13B, and GPT-NeoX models than KoboldAI does, since with KoboldAI, you either need a *very* powerful PC (or a server cluster) to run those models locally, or to wait however long it takes for the Colab to load. Also, note that TextSynth has a rate limit for free users.
3. [Dreamily](https://dreamily.ai/). The AI is worse than what you get with KoboldAI or the TextSynth playground, but it's more convenient to use than KoboldAI, and has more features than the TextSynth playground.
4. [Hyperwrite](https://hyperwriteai.com/). It has free access to GPT-3. However, free users only get 1500 outputs per month. It's also pretty lacking in features, and it uses OpenAI's filter, meaning that things like sex and violence are disallowed. It's still a decent option, but only if you play little enough to not run out of your 1500 monthly outputs, and only if you exclusively use the AI for family-friendly content.

As for flat cost alternatives, I don't know of any worth mentioning. The few I *do* know of are either just outright worse than one or more of the alternatives I just mentioned, or play too differently from AID to really scratch the same itch.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-08-22-054953","1661140193","None","False","0","ila2xrm","False","t3_wuipka","False","t1_ila2xrm","False","t3_wuipka","/r/AIDungeon/comments/wuipka/ai_dungeon_alternative_that_has_a_flatcost_or_is/ila2xrm/","1662632980","15","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

The default Nerys 13B can also do it, but since that one is also geared towards regular writing you have to enable adventure mode in the settings if you wish to use it.

Story text &gt; Memory &gt; World Info

Regards memory, you can write as much as you want in memory but if it reaches it‚Äôs limit (1000 words but Im not sure, it used to be shown in memory tab) then it randomly picks out chunk of 1000 words for use, meaning it will always be using the number of tokens it‚Äôs supposed to use for stable work

So basically no, program always keeps the AI with limited information and giant walls of text generally only help AI as they allow it make connections and references to World info if keywords get triggered","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-08-22-165844","1661180324","None","False","0","ilbui3u","False","t3_wud0d3","False","t1_ilbui3u","False","t1_ilbrefo","/r/AIDungeon/comments/wud0d3/about_characters/ilbui3u/","1662630573","1","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

Also, in theory, their filters should automatically block some results silently, or produce generation errors in some particularly severe cases (For example - the AI cannot produce to generate blah-blah).

So, if the AI allows you to generate that content with no problems - you can do this in private stories. They shouldn't even block you if you're trying to generate restricted content.

This means we won‚Äôt have any flags, suspensions, or bans for anything users do in single-player play. We will have technological barriers that will seek to prevent the AI from generating content we aren‚Äôt okay with it creating ‚Äî but there won‚Äôt be consequences for users and no humans will review those users‚Äô content if those walls are hit.

When it was initially introduced, it disallowed pedophilia and bestiality (although the bestiality censorship was later removed). Later on, a change made to the filter caused it to have issues with incest (this was apparently unintentional, according to Latitude, but I'm not sure it was ever fixed). Anyways, the filter never disallowed rape. There is also no conceivable way that the filter could've been removed ""a few years ago""; the filter was only added 16 months ago, and AID, itself, hasn't even existed for 3 years.

Although, for a while, even before the filter was implemented, the word ""rape"", in particular, was censored. Just ""rape"", no other words. At first, Latitude decided to censor ""rape"" by replacing ""rape"" with ""show respect to"" whenever the player tried to say ""rape"" in one of their inputs. After some mild backlash because of that, Latitude ended up simply making the AI unable to output the word ""rape"". Not sure if ""rape"" is still censored, though.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-08-23-194118","1661276478","None","False","0","ilhep9o","False","t3_wvtq5i","False","t1_ilhep9o","True","t1_ilha9dt","/r/AIDungeon/comments/wvtq5i/is_forceful_sex_rape_allowed/ilhep9o/","1662623120","3","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

This filter basically then flagged every account which even hinted at the word ""girl"" ""boy"" or any number below 18, in any story at all. Resulting in most users being falsely accused of being perverts. 

It was shortly after that disaster, another disaster arose, when it was discovered that Latitude staff read users private stories.

After that, they chose to introduce ""scales"" a form of currency, which severely limited the use of the software.

Meanwhile, the software itself has been dumbed down, and in many cases is barely coherent.

Most recently, they chose to remove scales and implement ad revenue instead. Which was also met with disappointment and disapproval.

Most users have now moved on to other company's versions of AI, which sprung up when it became obvious that Latitude was determined to destroy its own company.

2. No it doesn't. I think you might be confusing fan-made guides with official documentation. Official documentation is lacking somewhat though, I agree.
3. Not sure what you mean? The trial is indeed a trial. As in: NAI isn't a free service and the trial doesn't refresh.
4. Pretty sure they don't ban anyone from the site. Do you mean the discord? Mods tend to fairly lenient there and they usually only ban for severe misconduct.
5. support@novelai.net for customer support. If you don't want to engage with the community no one is forcing you to.
6. Uh mkay? Sorry, no idea what point you are trying to make here.
7. Sorry, but I have my doubts. Been on the discord for a while and mods seem fairly relaxed to me. Severe misconduct gets you banned on their discord (actually usually just muted for a little while) just as on the Latitude discord.
8. I guess you are talking about the discord and not NAI itself? That's not a nice thing to say, but you'll have insensitive users in any community.

I Bought my prebuilt PC and didn't understand certain things about setting up the Audio..

They had a helpline.. it was only open certain days of the week and not open on holidays. They can't even do that ?

Okay , what is fan guides ?? the fucking thing has been out for only for a good three or four  and half years at best , I Know what I saw.. the stuff was officially made by NovelAI

Yes it is the internet.. so again... lets virtue signal about me using 4chan as I'm disabled and ignore actual issues of people doing horrible shit online towards people who have disabilities. it isn't like it makes treating people less than dirt than less horrible and invalidates the shit the company does in ire of it

Also , define severe misconduct , they banned me for calling someone mentally disabled when I have an already present disability when he basically attacked me out of somewhere and than when I confronted him over what he did from last time since he literally caused me an anxiety attack he calls me an autist (""*whilst again as your doing it's the internet so get over it""* as I'm banned for the same thing he was doing right now but he's literally doing it to a disabled person so you'd expect that person to be banned for being ableist or some garbage they have in there mindset for doing to me in the first place)

also if you didn't understand the context 6. either read the big glowing letters that say ""I have derealization and can't type for shit since my eyesight is poor and hate wearing glasses or perhaps something else""

And besides what do I ask them ? are you suggesting I email a support @ for every question I have based on which type of story I have ? can you just admit that was why the discord was established as a quick solution that as opposed to a helpline people could text-too on certain days quite possibly along with the Email","True","True","None","comment score below threshold","LOW_SCORE","None","0","2022-08-24-175847","1661356727","None","1661358570.0","0","illxjd4","True","t3_wwkkip","False","t1_illxjd4","False","t1_illtqwt","/r/AIDungeon/comments/wwkkip/more_reasons_why_not_to_use_novelai_yes_i_am_the/illxjd4/","1662617061","-5","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

1. [KoboldAI](https://github.com/KoboldAI/KoboldAI-Client). You can use it to either run AI models locally if you have a powerful enough PC, or you can use the Google Colab, in which case the AI models will run on Google's servers instead of on your own PC. It has the best models, and most features, out of any free alternatives. (This part in parentheses isn't copy/pasted; I just want to link the [Colab](https://KoboldAI.org/colab) since people ask for the link every time I mention it.)
2. The [TextSynth Playground](https://textsynth.com/playground.html). It only really has the bare minimum in terms of features, and is overall worse than KoboldAI, but it allows more convenient access to the GPT-J 6B, Fairseq-13B, and GPT-NeoX models than KoboldAI does, since with KoboldAI, you either need a *very* powerful PC (or a server cluster) to run those models locally, or to wait however long it takes for the Colab to load. Also, note that TextSynth has a rate limit for free users.
3. [Dreamily](https://dreamily.ai/). The AI is worse than what you get with KoboldAI or the TextSynth playground, but it's more convenient to use than KoboldAI, and has more features than the TextSynth playground.
4. [Hyperwrite](https://hyperwriteai.com/). It has free access to GPT-3. However, free users only get 1500 outputs per month. It's also pretty lacking in features, and it uses OpenAI's filter, meaning that things like sex and violence are disallowed. It's still a decent option, but only if you play little enough to not run out of your 1500 monthly outputs, and only if you exclusively use the AI for family-friendly content.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-08-24-192936","1661362176","None","False","0","ilmc45p","False","t3_wwcoct","False","t1_ilmc45p","False","t3_wwcoct","/r/AIDungeon/comments/wwcoct/any_good_free_aidungeon_alternatives/ilmc45p/","1662616517","8","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

That's a complete lie. Speaking as someone who was a paid member during that time, it completely destroyed what Latitude had built up, and there are MANY Reddit users here who left AID for that exact reason.

Not at all. Ads have been universally despised, A product worth having can always find a better way of financing their work.

This is hilarious to me. NovelAI currently is YEARS ahead of anything AID can do. Even Dreamily and HoloAI are more cohesive than AID at this point. Why are you lying?

&gt;The whole idea that the Filter is some form of censorship or it dumbs down the AI is just a flat-out lie, disinformation spread by those who made stories involving the very thing it destroyed, they are vengeful.

Oh boy, you are really misguided. Perhaps you simply weren't there, or you are extremely gullible, but as I said, I was a paid member at that time, and I can assure you, that you are wrong.  

However, I'll just leave it there. I really have no interest in arguing a point on here that has been proven so many times already.

I'm happy for you that you are content to support an inferior product, but your erroneous views don't change the fact that there are better and more advanced products on the market now, and AID's mistakes have cost them a lot of users.

"[]","False","None","PikeldeoAcedia","1618486137","None","None","[]","None","None","None","text","t2_bjxon9zg","False","False","April 27th of 2021, Latitude implemented a filter for private adventures. They officially announced the filter the next day. Latitude claimed the filter was *only* supposed to filter pedophilic content (although there was a pretty obvious attempt to filter bestiality, as the filter had issues with animals). At the time the filter was added, it was just laughably bad. Mentioning a child, or an animal, or a number below 18, or a sexual term, regardless of the context, triggered the filter when it was first added. The devs also said they'd be monitoring private stories that triggered the filter, which was seen as a privacy violation given how faulty the filter was. There was also nothing preventing the AI from giving outputs that the filter would disallow.

Latitude made some changes to the filter early on. The first major changes were the removal of the censorship of animals, and the change to a two-column filter, where you'd have to use one of the censored words relating to minors, *and* one of the censored words relating to sex, within the last 400 or so characters of the story to trigger the filter. The term ""pedoph"" (and any words containing the term) was an outlier, as it would trigger the filter on it's own, without any other censored words having to be present.

The filter still wasn't good after that, though, since it was, of course, incapable of understanding context. The way they went about filtering also meant that it was incredibly easy for people actually using the AI for pedophilic content to avoid the filter if they knew how. It also meant that words containing censored terms could trigger the filter. As some examples: ""Infantry"" (contained ""infant""), ""breastplate"" (contained ""breast""), ""analysis"" (contained ""anal""), ""cocky"" and ""cockpit"" (both contained ""cock""), ""boyfriend"" and ""girlfriend"" (contained ""boy"" and ""girl"", respectively), etc. Latitude, within a couple of weeks of the filter's existence, also added an automated suspension system that would sometimes automatically suspend players for triggering the filter for up to a week.

It was also [found that AI Dungeon's finetuning data contained some pedophilic content](https://gitgud.io/AuroraPurgatio/aurorapurgatio), which made the AI more likely to output pedophilic content, itself, and which a lot of users saw as being hypocritical.

Additionally, there was a [data breach](https://github.com/AetherDevSecOps/aid_adventure_vulnerability_report) that occured about 2 weeks prior to the filter controversy, and that the AI Dungeon community only found out about during the controversy, apparently allowing all private content, except for private content from the first 11 days of AI Dungeon 2's existence, to be accessed. Latitude failed to disclose the breach for months, which people were understandably upset about. It wasn't until 5 months after the breach occurred that [Latitude finally disclosed the breach](https://latitude.io/blog/data-incident-april-2021).

There was also the issue of the moderation of private stories being outsourced to strangers on the internet via a website called ""Taskup"". As a result of this outsourcing, over 100 private stories ended up being leaked on 4chan. To be fair, it [later came to light that the outsourcing was the doing of OpenAI (the company that used to provide Latitude with their AI models), rather than Latitude's doing](https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/pze72g/updated_related_to_taskup_questions/), but that was unknown for months, and regardless of who was responsible for the outsourcing, people were still upset about such a breach of privacy.

Aside from that, during the controversy, several features of AI Dungeon were either made worse, or removed entirely. The ""Explore"" feature, which allowed users to share prompts and stories, and to communicate with one another, was also removed just 2 weeks before the controversy started. That definitely wasn't the cause of the controversy, but it added fuel to the fire regardless. It also didn't help that Latitude went radio silent for most of the controversy.

More recently, only about a week and a half ago, there was also [another data breach](https://help.aidungeon.io/faq/s3-buckets-15aug22).

I find it less polished for PC users, though more in line with phone users. It feels... clunky and uninuitive in PC? Maybe that's me.

As for the space issue, [this](https://ibb.co/MNQrwB1) is what annoys the hell out of me (see that those spaces were not added by me), and I suspect it behaves like that because of the new image system you've been trying to add, making those spaces so you can ""add an image"" to the text. Now, I don't use images, and I don't want to use images, so having much more organized UI outputs like [this](https://ibb.co/z4QnXgs) is far better, letting me add the ""in-between paragraph spaces"" by my own self.In fact, I'd give you extra feedback on the credit score showing up in the UI; add an option to hide it, just like energy back in the time: ""Only appear when low on credits,"" or ""don't show at all."" It's distracting.

I still don't understand why doom one set of users while trying to implement something for other users. It's always better to have choices, and pardon my ignorance, I don't know if having multiple option in the UI is expensive... but if you could add different ways of ""personalizing"" the UI, that'd be awesome.

All that being said, I would want to spoil no one's fun. If you enjoy using AID despite its many issues, don't let anyone stop you! I would just caution you to keep in mind that they have proven to be unreliable and insecure, so to not regret things later, take some precautions:

* Regularly back up anything you don't want to lose. AID is no stranger to data loss.
* *Never ever* put information about yourself into your stories that could be used to identify you. AID had **3** cases of story data breaches *in just 1.5 years*! And these might just the ones we learned about. Yet, story data storage is still not end-to-end encrypted (unlike in NAI or HAI).
* If you are spending money, it doesn't hurt to compare to competitors, just to make sure you get as much enjoyment as possible for your money. NovelAI and HoloAI both have a free trial.

Good point on the cancel action. We removed it because we added auto-saving, but given the interaction, I agree that we need it back for now. The ideal is document-style editing, which will come in the future. But until then, while clunky to even have '...' showing up at times, I agree that we need that. 

For the second issue, this was a bug where deleting an image left spaces ... that should now be solved. If that's still happening, please let me know and share how you got the weird spacing to happen. 

Finally, thanks for the feedback about credits showing. It makes sense that it could be distracting.

2. HoloAI has a new $12 subscription tier.
3. KoboldAI has a newer version of their [Google Colab](https://koboldai.org/colab) that's significantly easier to use, *and* that allows access to Fairseq-13B and GPT-NeoX.
4. AI Dungeon Clover Edition is gone. Not entirely sure why, but the Github page is just gone.
5. EndlessVN is now in open alpha.
6. A couple of new notable alternatives have been made.

1. OpenAI's models were ridiculously expensive to use.
2. OpenAI wanted to enforce heavy censorship that would disallow sexual and violent content, along with some other stuff.
3. OpenAI is generally a shitty company, and they, without Latitude's knowledge or permission, outsourced the moderation of private stories to strangers on the internet, which ended up resulting in over 100 private stories being leaked on 4chan.

Anyways, the current models are pretty much unanimously considered to be worse than the old ones. Several miscellaneous features were also removed or made worse in the past year or so. Also, for whatever reason, during the past year or so, issues with the site have been especially common. Certain aspects of the site, or the site as a whole, tend to break pretty frequently nowadays.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-08-25-213627","1661456187","None","False","0","ilrwocw","False","t3_wxgqbh","False","t1_ilrwocw","False","t1_ilrk9kg","/r/AIDungeon/comments/wxgqbh/it_keeps_repeating_the_prompt/ilrwocw/","1662608990","1","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

1. [KoboldAI](https://github.com/KoboldAI/KoboldAI-Client). You can use it to either run AI models locally if you have a powerful enough PC, or you can use the [Google Colab](https://KoboldAI.org/colab), in which case the AI models will run on Google's servers instead of on your own PC. It has the best models, and most features, out of any free alternatives.
2. The [TextSynth Playground](https://textsynth.com/playground.html). It only really has the bare minimum in terms of features, and is overall worse than KoboldAI, but it allows more convenient access to the GPT-J 6B, Fairseq-13B, and GPT-NeoX models than KoboldAI does, since with KoboldAI, you either need a *very* powerful PC (or a server cluster) to run those models locally, or to wait however long it takes for the Colab to load. Also, note that TextSynth has a rate limit for free users.
3. [Dreamily](https://dreamily.ai/). The AI is worse than what you get with KoboldAI or the TextSynth playground, but it's more convenient to use than KoboldAI, and has more features than the TextSynth playground.
4. [Hyperwrite](https://hyperwriteai.com/). It has free access to GPT-3. However, free users only get 1500 outputs per month. It's also pretty lacking in features, and it uses OpenAI's filter, meaning that things like sex and violence are disallowed. It's still a decent option, but only if you play little enough to not run out of your 1500 monthly outputs, and only if you exclusively use the AI for family-friendly content.

Also, [HoloAI](https://writeholo.com/) isn't free, but is notable for being the most affordable paid option. Its three subscription tiers are each about half the price of their AID counterparts. So, you might be able to reasonably afford a HoloAI subscription.

Anyways, about the post, AI models *are* very expensive to run. If Latitude were selling the Steam version in other places at lower prices in certain places, they'd likely end up losing money because of it. It sucks that the Steam version is overly expensive in some of those places as a result of Latitude not lowering the prices of the Steam version to account for places with worse currencies, but from a business standpoint, it would've been a pretty bad idea for Latitude to lower the price in those places.

With that said, I'm... honestly not sure I believe the claim that Latitude needed to implement ads to stay afloat. Back in late 2020, Latitude implemented energy to help cut costs, and that was seemingly good enough for over a year. Latitude also added microtransactions, removed several features to cut costs, such as text-to-speech, the quest log, the Classic AI, the hardcore and adventure modes, etc., *and* Latitude now uses cheaper AI models than before. The subscriptions are also more expensive than before, and there's now a Steam version that they claim will be profitable. I have a bit of a difficult time believing that Latitude is still having financial issues after all of the measures they've taken to cut costs and to make more profit since late 2020.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-08-26-211450","1661541290","None","1661541980.0","0","ilwoxod","False","t3_wycg4b","False","t1_ilwoxod","False","t3_wycg4b","/r/AIDungeon/comments/wycg4b/rant_about_ai_dungeon/ilwoxod/","1662602302","3","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

With all due respect my man, you're literally just pulling numbers out of your ass. Like, you completetely made those up based on absolutely nothing but a gut feeling. And even then, it doesn't actually amount to any sort of real argument.

Processing power costs money, and the more of it you have, the better your AI will work. I'm sorry to be blunt, but it really is that simple.

&gt;I don't know what Novel AI is but i heard it was better.

You use those to direct the AI, for example in Author's Note I usually put what is happening in the current scene, and in Memory I put a summary of what's happened to date.

 Using those in both AID and NovelAI still gives me a better experience in NovelAI.

But it's still a far from what it was in early 2021. So, I don't recommend buying it right now if it's a text generator you're interested in.

I, on the other hand, have decided to take a break and wait until they release something really interesting in terms of text adventures.

I've tried AID and NovelAI, and after getting some good tunings for both, and experimenting with memory etc, I prefer NovelAI.

I've tried Dragon with tunings recommended by the Discord, and it's still not great. It's not terrible, but it's slower to generate than NovelAI and it tends to breakdown into long chains of ""you say"", ""he says"" dialogue with no description or action. Dragon is usually pretty good until it gets to that point, then it's just unsalvageable for me.

I don't know if NovelAI is better for crazy unexpected actions, or if AID does that better. I haven't tried to compare the two over that. I suspect AID might be better at it. AID is certainly more chaotic.

NovelAI has a text adventure mode, though it's a bit unintuitive. You can press ctrl-Enter on a blank story/adventure to have it start generating for you, a little bit like AID's prompts.

I find I'm starting things off in AID, because I prefer the prompts with worldbuilding and everything, then if I like the story I copy it over to NovelAI's Krake whenever AID is getting too repetitive/uncreative and continue it there.

AID's image generation is great, including the Voyage AI ArtStudio.

ETA: I've had some great and emotional adventures on AID just with Griffin or Griffin-Hydra. Haven't had anything close to those in NovelAI, but I haven't really used it for a text adventure from start to finish.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-08-28-183225","1661704345","None","1661705589.0","0","im58cjd","False","t3_wzohr9","False","t1_im58cjd","False","t3_wzohr9","/r/AIDungeon/comments/wzohr9/honest_question_is_it_even_still_worth_to_play/im58cjd/","1662590583","4","False","False","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

1. The [TextSynth Playground](https://textsynth.com/playground.html). It only really has the bare minimum in terms of features, and is overall worse than KoboldAI, but it allows more convenient access to the GPT-J 6B, Fairseq-13B, and GPT-NeoX models than KoboldAI does, since with KoboldAI, you either need a *very* powerful PC (or a server cluster) to run those models locally, or to wait however long it takes for the Colab to load. Also, note that TextSynth has a rate limit for free users.
2. [Dreamily](https://dreamily.ai/). The AI is worse than what you get with KoboldAI or the TextSynth playground, but it's more convenient to use than KoboldAI, and has more features than the TextSynth playground.
3. [Hyperwrite](https://hyperwriteai.com/). It has free access to GPT-3. However, free users only get 1500 outputs per month. It's also pretty lacking in features, and it uses OpenAI's filter, meaning that things like sex and violence are disallowed. It's still a decent option, but only if you play little enough to not run out of your 1500 monthly outputs, and only if you exclusively use the AI for family-friendly content.

There *are* other free options, but most of them, such as GodAI, AID2 Unleashed, Write with Transformer, and such, are just objectively worse than KoboldAI and/or the other alternatives that I just mentioned.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-08-28-233834","1661722714","None","False","0","im6gunt","False","t3_wzohr9","False","t1_im6gunt","False","t1_im6agu5","/r/AIDungeon/comments/wzohr9/honest_question_is_it_even_still_worth_to_play/im6gunt/","1662588878","4","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""

I don't think AI dungeon wants to sue people for that.

It wouldn't be a guaranteed win for them even if they did.

I'm certainly not a lawyer and you should consult one if you have questions.

First of all, I would argue that since the ai's output and training is based on other people's works in the first place, they wouldn't be able to claim it as their own.

It may change the content's form and mix and match, but it's still not really original content.

Back in the day, they had software they called article spinners. You could feed it an article and the software would use synonyms and change a few things and call it an original article. It never was and Google killed that stuff off.

I would also argue, the fact that you significantly alter the content, makes it yours.

And if you're a paid subscriber, it could be argued that you bought the content.

u/ryan_latitude could probably clarify more. I'm not even sure if I tagged him right. But like I said I'm not a lawyer but I've been a content provider for more than 25 years and I've had to be clear about the use of content.

Therefore, the AI forgets text outside this range. In addition, this memory is shared between MEM, AN(author's note), WI, and main text.

WI is inserted at the top of the input (""less used"" content), Mem is also inserted at the top (but lower than WI), and AN is inserted closer to the bottom (\\~3 outputs back from the last output, and has a much stronger effect).

So the input structure looks like -&gt; (WI-MEM-teext-AN-text), or it may look like -&gt; (MEM-teeeext-AN-text), or (WI-teeeext-AN-text), or (teeeeeeeext-AN-text) if WI/MEM are not used.

Mem(if filled) and AN are always inserted into the AI input, so they are always active and in use.

You can think of WI as a temporary MEM that is inserted by keywords and then, automatically removed after some time if the keywords are not used.

The more you use Mem, AN, WI, the less memory is left for the main text (the active story). So you have to write it all as short as possible if you want to use tons of WI at once. There should be limits, but I don't remember them.

You can check the current active text that the AI used by clicking ""Inspect input"". Note that any changes you made to WI, AN, MEM will be inserted into the AI input after 3-4 ""retries"", or generating new outputs.

A few keywords should be used to describe the WI trigger. For example, we have a character (Demon Queen Mary Teresa), and you can use that as one long keyword. But it's better to use 4 (or more) different keywords (demons, demon, queen, mary, teresa) to trigger the WI, or combinations (demon queen, mary teresa, ruler, evil, blah-blah) unless you want the WI to trigger every time you mention a demon, demons or a queen.

As for the WI description, it's better to use a brief, or a normal literature description (depends on the situation), or even some short styles (but I haven't tested them).

Also, if you fill in memory or WI as normal text - the AI should use it as a normal part of the story. But, if you put the text in \\[ \\] - \\[ You are blah blah blah. \\], the AI should take it more as (write something based on ""You are blah blah blah.""). But I'm not sure about the \\[ \\] part, since I haven't tested this property with the new Griffin.

As for AN - it's used to describe styles and similar things that affect the text overall. You can start with a brief description of the plot and scene to keep the AI on track, or you could also try using tone, writing stiles(or even tags, or genre but it's more difficult) etc.

Most importantly, more powerful AIs work better with WI, MEM, AN than Griffin.","True","False","None","None","None","None","0","2022-08-31-195227","1661968347","None","1662031351.0","0","imjtsf8","False","t3_x28qib","False","t1_imjtsf8","True","t1_imj6oov","/r/AIDungeon/comments/x28qib/any_tips_on_creating_nfsw_entities/imjtsf8/","1662570656","2","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","",""
