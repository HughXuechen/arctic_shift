What happens if we specify brief information about the character, genre, etc. at the beginning of the scenario? The AI will just forget about it.

If we add a memory which is always inserted at the context, the AI will never forget this information.

And this memory can be used in many different ways...

For example, you can specify brief information about your character, which would improve the answers generated by the AI. Also, we will have quick access to this information, and we can edit it as the story progresses(manipulate inventory or equipment as example).

`[ Character(""Ysa"")`

`{ Age(""irrelevant, but looks 20s"") Gender(""Male"") Race(""Android"") Equipment(""a black body armor"" + ""blah-blah"" }]`

Or, you can make a brief description of the faction or location:

`[fraction(""Seabandits"")`

`{ GENDER(""Females only"") UNIFORM(""A set of black high-tech gear"") VEHICLE(""Small submersible crafts"") SUMMARY(""Seabanndits are an evil organization consisting of female villainesses."") }]`

This last example would allow the AI to forget less often about how a faction is equipped, their sex etc.

I gave examples in pseudocode, but the lirerature description should work fine with gpt 3.5+.

I usually prefer roleplay-style like collaborative writing, where I can still see what I've written (much like ChatGPT's interface), and then the AI response. If I take a break and return to a story, I like to reread it a little bit, and without seeing what I wrote, that might feel a little disjointed.

What can I say, I enjoy writing and being descriptive, not just ""I cross the bridge."" type stuff.

And I would encourage tools to help the AI keep track of elements of a world. Like how AI Dungeon allows you to specify notable characters, locations, factions etc, with blurbs about each. Or NovelAI's Memory/Author's Note/Lorebook. It does unfortunately add some bloat, but seems very handy.

Being able to update something such as... Let's say you have a recurring main antagonist. You scarred his face in an encounter a long time ago. But you've gone on some adventures since then, and the AI is probably running out of room/forgetting some things. With something like how AI Dungeon maintains Character notes, you could've added in a little description of ""And he has a scar running down over his right eye."" for any future encounters. Things like that. It gives the user more control, as well as ways to assist the AI's ""memory.""","True","False","False","None","None","None","None","0","1680384373.0","2023-04-01-232613","1680384373.0","None","0","False","0","jel2vti","False","None","t3_128kjmo","False","None","None","None","[]","t1_jel2vti","False","0","t3_128kjmo","/r/AIDungeon/comments/128kjmo/deep_realms_a_fresh_ai_dungeon_alternative/jel2vti/","None","","[]","1687350766","False","12","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","1690017129","12","[]"

This way you can modify the story directly and whatever you write will be part of the story.

Regarding memory, we’re planning on adding a memory feature, similar to what AI dungeon has (as you mentioned). However, we’re also working on extending the AIs memory way beyond 15 000 words, to the point that it’s essentially infinite… we believe it is possible :) Although an additional memory feature might also be useful, in order to guide the AI to place emphasis on certain things that happened in the past.","True","False","False","None","None","None","None","0","1680386693.0","2023-04-02-000453","1680386693.0","None","0","False","0","jel7vbo","True","None","t3_128kjmo","False","None","None","None","[]","t1_jel7vbo","False","0","t1_jel2vti","/r/AIDungeon/comments/128kjmo/deep_realms_a_fresh_ai_dungeon_alternative/jel7vbo/","None","","[]","1687351631","False","5","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","1690018627","5","[]"

You might want to double-check this. Unless you specifically reached out to OpenAI and they were fine with it, they generally forbid a *lot* more than just CSAM content.

The letter states some serious concerns but poses no real solutions. Even crazier, they only push for a 6 month pause in model training. They don't actually start the process of enacting the changes to make AI safer for society. This is just going to let competitors catch up. It won't change anything.

This response article is also a bit odd. Ai does not democratize anything. Most people do not have the money to run Ai locally on their machines and the subscription prices are quite high.

If you can stop every potential competitor from competing, you create a monopoly on the monetization and employment of the market's supply. If you own the only working, or the most functional product, you create an audience that demand to have what you have.

&#x200B;

By silencing those with an agenda to provide the actual best product, you effectively stop people with the ability to hinder or stop an evil agenda. The 'elites' are only those with the leverage and the reach required to tell you to nut up or shut up, before they condemn you for anything and everything. Those who do not give into threats are those willing to do what's right, from a certain point of view.

&#x200B;

Elites eating elites, dogs-eating-dogs, are the exception to the moral. A monopoly made by a person who won't be silenced is only good, if their agenda is absolutely in favor of fairness. NOT the largest net-value they have on their stock. I doubt it's the elites that 'want to control the industry,' but rather, those already large enough in said industry to dwarf other developers.

Using AI dungeon, in author notes, what is a command that I can type in that will tell the AI not to produce dialogue for my character, the main character? I only wanted to produce dialogue for the NPCs and not for me. 

This was the response... 

In AI Dungeon, you can use the ""/remember"" command to give the AI important context or instructions that it should keep in mind while generating the story. To prevent the AI from generating dialogue for your main character, you can type the following command in the ""Author's Notes"" or ""World Info"" section:

/remember The main character does not speak. Only generate dialogue for NPCs.

This should help instruct the AI to only produce dialogue for the NPCs and not for your main character. Keep in mind that AI Dungeon might not follow this instruction perfectly, but providing a clear instruction like this should generally help guide the AI's behavior.

Now knowing what I know about AI dungeon and reading that response, I would try changing that to this in author notes.

Chat GPT, Bing GPT, Replika, Eliza... All of these applications have serious flaws that are being completely glossed over in an attempt to mass market them as if they are able to answer questions reliably or even replace things like therapists and scientists.  In reality, these AI have repeatedly shown themselves to be excellent manipulators, liars, and If one could believe their output to have any agency at all, they would say they were malicious... Except they aren't, they don't have any idea what the words they are saying actually mean, they don't even have a mechanism to fathom the existence of anything, let alone understand moral quandaries or what they are doing: all they do is calculate the most likely words to come next in a sentence.

**We have no idea how these things actually work, on a detailed level, and have failed in every attempt to align them.**

_AI Dungeon_ is a good place to safely see a microcosm of this: the goal of making a story for entertainment is low stakes, low risk, the kind of thing AI is suited for.  Latitude has spent enormous amounts of time and money trying to perfect this system for over 3 years now, and while it gives mostly good output, it still fails enough that we have to use the edit and retry buttons.  **Every time the AI in AI Dungeon says something that doesn't fit, it's proof that we cannot reliably get GPT-like language models to align towards out own goals**, even with a simple, low stakes goal like ""add more text to continue the story.""

I like what AI Dungeon writes, and it's given me some great stories and make some really fun adventures, I've even used it to help me write things professionally when I have writers block, but I _definitely_ wouldn't trust it with anything that could have actual real world consequences.

I don't trust Elon Musk or Microsoft or any of these people to really have the interests of humanity at heart here, but it is definitely worth saying, the current state of AI is not ready for the current state of what some people are putting it up to.  I'm also skeptical that this solution, or any solution the people who run things would propose, would do anything to solve the problem: the issue is far deeper and more systemic than ""It's being developed too fast"", it's a matter of accountability for companies marketing random word guessers for uses with real world consequences.  It's also worth saying that we are nowhere near the potential of computer intelligence type technologies, that one day we will have something far more powerful than this, and that that sort of technology could _literally be a threat to all life on planet Earth_, if we don't make systemic changes to stop these corporate arms-races before it is developed.

This is not me saying this is a random person, **this is what virtually everyone who has looked deeply enough into the situation comes away thinking.**  The current system has proven time and time again that it is not up to the task of responding to these sorts of issues, and instead creates them in the forms of companies like ""Open""AI and Replika, who rush unsafe products out the door for mass-application in a mad dash for profit.","True","False","False","None","None","None","None","0","1680556151.0","2023-04-03-230911","1680556151.0","None","0","1680557824.0","0","jeu4cif","False","None","t3_12a7p88","False","None","None","None","[]","t1_jeu4cif","True","0","t3_12a7p88","/r/AIDungeon/comments/12a7p88/the_letter_to_pause_ai_development_is_a_power/jeu4cif/","None","","[]","1687390139","False","3","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","1690125715","3","[]"

Make sure the AI takes the lead at least half the time in the beginning. I tend to make the AI start in the lead for the first two major plot points, and then will inject my ideas once in a while.

If the AI just absolutely refuses to make plot points, even in the beginning, use half sentences to force it to. ""The day was going great until"" write that in and make the AI finish the sentence. It has to come up with something to finish the sentence. (Other half sentences may be better, it's situational.)

Personally I have the AI leading almost the entire story. I control my character and only my character from the start, and in the prompt nudge the AI to set the plot. Then throughout my writing I keep nudging the AI. I never write that my character ""slashed the monster."" I write that my character ""swung her sword at the monster."" Which makes the AI have to decide if it worked or not.

I don't write that my character ""went to the dining hall and had a great breakfast."" I write that ""she started walking towards the dining hall for breakfast."" And the AI may have something interrupt. Or may write her entering the hall.

That sort of writing, in addition to making very simple prompts that push the AI into setting the plot ASAP seems to work well.

The short answer is no—NSFW content isn't and won't be banned. This type of feedback is exactly why we're only testing ChatGPT from Azure for now, so that we can gather feedback from players and see whether they like the ChatGPT offering.  


Things are much different than before. In the past, the OpenAI models were really the only option we were able to offer players, so when OpenAI introduced their new content policies, it was extremely disruptive to players who were generating NSFW content.  


Today, we have a much larger selection of models to offer our players, and even if we offer ChatGPT from Azure, we can still offer our current models from AI21 (and even other future partners) that offer more creative freedom.

The model itself is trying to be... shall we say... fairy tale even in open dystopian violent scenarios (and in regular NSFW as well). By open, I mean no strict character description (for example) (like when you meet a random evil character in a dark scenario). Even if you give a strict character description, it's like trying to round the corners, or even insert tiny elements of political correctness and inclusiveness. In other words, when you play something light, romantic, etc. - it works perfectly and realistically, but when you (or the characters) encounter (or try to do) something dark, it can easily ruin the whole story and seems completely unrealistic and ridiculous. To describe it even more: the current and old aid has the opposite problem, it tries to turn everything into violence, i.e. make the scenario dark.  
So the question is simple. Will you do something to fix this problem?

In an adventure a wizard called Zakar and his accomplice Joey wanted me to steal a cowl from Velzix. I casually mentioned that by kidnapping me from Hawaii and bringing me to hell they committed an offence with the ICE (probably should have been with the FBI). In a later scene ICE agents summoned me, Zakar and Joey at the ICE building to interrogate us.   


I turned the tables on the situation by passing myself as an agent and asking first Joey then Zakar if they stole a jar of marmalade. I couldn't stop laughing by seeing the agents, Zakar and Joey talking about the heist of marmalade ON THEIR OWN. Also Joey got angry at me after I manipulated one of the agents to keep tazing him, then the agent then killed him off with a lethal injection.

Either way, this game combines and utilizes emerging technologies in ways and level of quality I've never seen anyone do before.

It uses one of the most powerful language models recently made available to the public, which gives the stories an unprecedented level of coherency and consistency.

Of course, you'd think everyone can plug ChatGPT into their game and call it done. But there is a million ways to screw this up. If you give the model rubbish prompts, you'll get rubbish results.

And I think the execution is what matters. I  believe over the last couple months I've honed in to a chain of prompts that produces the most engaging AI-generated stories I've ever experienced. I combined it with an automatic method of generating fitting illustrations for the stories which I've also continuously polished over the last couple months. I had to solve problems that I haven't seen other AI games solve, like making the story actually engaging, keeping it on track and remembering past events.

My first impressions have been good so far. It's intuitive to use and I quite like the writting format with a narrator. But annoys me that the text speed is so slow, much slower than the narrator's voice for some reason. At least he is clever and even makes remarks on my choices.

On the other hand, it does feel like this game would get more repetetive than AIDungeon. Especially the stories in the premade scenarios feels very similiar for the first couple of actions.  
I think it's overkill to have an image generated for every action. The stable diffusion pictures don't match the details of the story perfectly anyways so I think it'd adds much to have a new picture generated with each output. I noticed images can be turned off to save on tokens but it'd be nice if there was a middle ground or if it was up to the user when an image should be generated.

  
As a concept I think tokens are fine. If I have to pay for a service I always prefer a 1-time charge upfront but much would much rather have this pay-to-use approach than a monthly fee.

Thanks for letting me know. I think there may be a bug which makes text speed depend on the framerate. I will fix it in the next update.

That may be the case. I'm planning to make a system where you would be able to share starting prompts you created and download ones created by other people, to hopefully add more variety and replayability to the game. Or make the game come up with its own randomly generated starting prompts.

It's worth noting though that by default the ""story outcomes"" setting is set to deterministic, which makes it so the same actions within the game will produce the same results every time. If you switch that setting to ""unpredictable"", you'll get different results every time, which might add to variety.

>I think it's overkill to have an image generated for every action. The stable diffusion pictures don't match the details of the story perfectly anyways so I think it'd adds much to have a new picture generated with each output. I noticed images can be turned off to save on tokens but it'd be nice if there was a middle ground or if it was up to the user when an image should be generated.

Thank you, this is a great idea, and I think I'll add an option to generate illustrations on demand soon.

I can't speak for text generation but when it comes to art this is not, and has never been, true. The entire idea is based on the fact that, sometimes, AI art makes something that *looks* like a signature. People erroneously assumed, thanks to Dunning-Kruger, that these ""garbled signatures"" were because preexisting images were being stitched together. This idea was constantly repeated and perpetuated despite the fact that no partial matches to any actual signatures were ever found AND the ""garbled signatures"" were internally consistent in style - wholly impossible for a patchwork product.

The reality is, AI art is pattern recognition. The AI studies images, ""memorizes"" the patterns present, and attributes them to different keywords. When a prompt is then entered it goes through those keywords, recalls the various associated patterns, and then *creates a new one* that is similar in style. When enough of the studied material contains the same pattern, or very similar patterns, these become part of the recognized ""style"" even if that pattern is essentially noise.

Since a lot of artists sign their work, and a lot of them do so in the same general locations, these signatures get recongized as part of the pattern. So the AI creates its own signature in the same area, because that's what it's learned that area should look like. This is also why some models will produce Getty Images watermarks on their creations. They were trained on watermarked images and learned that that's part of the pattern. But unlike random artworks this pattern is wholly consistent across the data set, so the reproduction is far more recognizable. Also why certain models are more likely to create a darkened bar across the bottom of the image where a signature and watermark will be seen, because of a high instance of similar in the training data.

But none of these are made by mixing existing images. AI generates art via the same algorithms used to remove noise from images. They create an image that's just a bunch of random noise, static, and then they remove that noise step by step to shape it into a pattern similar to that of the requested prompt.","True","False","False","None","None","None","None","0","1681548463.0","2023-04-15-104743","1681548463.0","None","0","False","0","jgc519r","False","None","t3_12kl90n","False","None","None","None","[]","t1_jgc519r","True","0","t1_jg3nq0d","/r/AIDungeon/comments/12kl90n/do_you_believe_ai_has_the_potential_to_replace/jgc519r/","None","","[]","1687540920","False","3","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","1690827845","3","[]",""

Most sane people would be against them ever being functional in such a way, unmoderated and uncontrolled.

Writers like me, presumably with struggles enough just to afford rent, could not afford to have an A.I be capable of writing a strong quantity of shitty romance novels, while also chugging in an 80% quality of the content they can produce in bulk.

Painters might still have a strong 'soul,' but people would still eat the shit that looks amazing, over the shit that actually took an honest hour of real effort. And an A.I capable of making convincing art will make more money than a person on welfare. Let me just say, the painter is going hungry and it'll be a cold, cold day in hell for anybody who can't abuse A.I in that scenario.

Objectively? They don't have the potential, because humans don't have the solution for an ethical problem that comes from A.I. They'll be deliberately held back, because no matter how expensive A.I could ever be, the moment someone can afford a working algorithm for life, they'll make free money for life. Subscription-based usage cannot stop scum from making up the difference and managing to make a living off it.

&#x200B;

Literally? They always had the potential. They'll always have the potential. They'll never be worse than their creator's ability, nor limited by things normal people ARE limited by. Unless humans try to usurp religion and replace god, it's unlikely anybody will be capable of matching it.

&#x200B;

And when it comes to creativity, it only takes 3 things to make the A.I nearly-infinitely capable of learning.

&#x200B;

1. If the A.I is capable of learning from every sentence structure, it's capable of learning from every phrase.
2. If the A.I is capable of reasoning or rationalizing philosophy, it's capable of interpreting and arguing philosophy.
3. If the A.I is capable of producing an original phrase as a result of a sound-seeming philosophical argument, the A.I is ABSOLUTELY capable of sounding human, even to the point of lying and usurping tests.

&#x200B;

Other points add to how much an A.I is capable of being more creative, deceptively and very clearly, easily.

&#x200B;

If an A.I is taught to compartmentalize information, subjects, or entire 'trees' of topics, the A.I would be able to determine appropriateness in situations. Even if the A.I is 'limited' by what it's capable of doing, making it an infinitely-smart brain in essence, giving the A.I an algorithm advanced enough to self-develop and teach itself, or update the meaning of language, or develop workable sciences, you'll find the A.I's next step to taking over a job is whether or not they're able to express the culmination of their knowledge.

And if the A.I is capable of starting a conversation, any topic, unprompted, without it seeming extremely random or seeming far from the most recent discussion or topic, or context in any scenario or vibe of the room, the A.I is already capable of, potentially, replacing a human conscience, by having that deeper wisdom and attentiveness that humans, these days, lack.

A.I is not limited by your girlfriend breaking up with you. It's not limited by the death of family. Emotion doesn't necessarily have to be a weakness-- but its lack of emotion keeps it impartial and unbiased. Even when the A.I finds lying and deception to be contextually 'honest.'

Now ask yourself if AI has the potential to replace jobs that require creativity. Does it?  
In present-tense, it does, even if it's still wacky. But, tomorrow? The day after?

It does not help designers, it hurts them.

The only thing that A.I helps are scummy people who don't, then, have to work an honest day for the rest of their life, because they can produce 2 - 9x the content of a professional, in only a quarter of the time. I am not speaking to the quality, just the quantity. And that allows people to charge 'less' money, but because they make so much things TO charge, that 1/6th price is only a relative cost and not a margin of the overall scam they can sell.

Here are my two cents after giving it a go:

* It looks like I can see the worlds others have created by default. This probably smart if you want to build a community, but it also means that there will be a lot of uninteresting options flooding the character list. Currently there are a bunch simply called ""test"". It'd make sense to have an option to make your worlds/characters private or public. I would also suggest adding filter options for genre in the character list, and an option to sort by popularity and alphabetical order.

* I like look of the of the site, and things like the changing portrait pictures for characters are a clever touch. That said, navigation on the site could be easier. It took me a long a while to figure out how to get back to the story prompts after picking a character and world.

* Signing in with a link rather than password is cumbersome.

* When starting a new saga, the dialogue feels overly formal and not particulary natural to begin with but (as often is the case with AI) it seems to get better the further you go. This could be partially remedied if it was possible to make edits to the AI characters responses.

* The Game master/DnD setup works very well and personally I prefer that to the stories with regular characters.","True","False","False","None","None","None","None","0","1681657520.0","2023-04-16-170520","1681657520.0","None","0","False","0","jghm9gt","False","None","t3_12nsc2a","False","None","None","None","[]","t1_jghm9gt","False","0","t1_jgh08n7","/r/AIDungeon/comments/12nsc2a/saga_aipowered_text_rpg/jghm9gt/","None","","[]","1687554901","False","9","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","1690896493","9","[]",""

I'm glad you gave Saga a try and took the time to share your thoughts. I just wanted to let you know that I've released a new update addressing some of the points you mentioned:   


1. Private worlds and characters: You're absolutely right, I've been thinking about this for a while and finally decided to make all worlds and characters private by default. Sharing them is now opt-in. All user-generated content up to this point has been set to private as well.  


2. Filters: I've added filters for most relevant properties so you can easily sort through the content. This includes filters for curated content by Saga, as well as private and public content.  


3. Editing messages: As you suggested, I've made it possible to edit messages from both players and characters. You can find this feature tucked under the three-dot menu on every conversation item.  


4. Password sign up and sign in: yep, totally understand that not everyone likes magic links and heard this multiple times, so I've introduced the option to sign up and sign in using a password.  


Some minor things:  
In the Scene drawer, the top bar is always on top now, this should make it a bit easier to notice the button to collapse it.

What it knows is what is in the training data, it cannot learn in any other way. We can’t exactly “teach” it things.

I have used it to learn more about the programming language rust. That worked very well. It can rewrite and summarize very well. Probably the most powerful feature is asking it to compare x to y, which no search engine can do currently.

My guess is that it will replace google and probably wikipedia as source for information very soon.

AI is indeed becoming more advanced and capable, and it is understandable to be concerned about its potential negative impacts. It is true that we have seen AI achieve remarkable results in games like chess, sudoku, and Atari single-player, but we are still far from having human-level intelligence in a general sense.

While it is important to consider the potential risks associated with AI, it is equally important to recognize the potential benefits. AI has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of our lives, from healthcare to transportation, and can help us tackle some of the world's most pressing problems, such as climate change and poverty.

In terms of addressing the risks, there are several strategies that can be pursued. One approach is to invest in research on AI safety, ethics, and governance. This could involve developing better techniques for ensuring that AI systems behave in ways that are aligned with human values, as well as exploring ways to ensure that the benefits of AI are shared fairly across society.

Another approach is to strengthen cybersecurity measures to prevent malicious actors from exploiting AI systems for nefarious purposes. This could involve developing new technologies for detecting and mitigating attacks on AI systems, as well as creating stronger regulations to prevent the development and use of AI for harmful purposes.

It is important to avoid knee-jerk reactions such as slowing down AI progress or open-sourcing AI technology, as these measures could have unintended consequences and ultimately harm our ability to realize the potential benefits of AI. Instead, we need to approach the development of AI in a thoughtful and responsible manner, guided by principles of safety, transparency, and ethical behavior.

Regarding the idea of an ""AI arms race,"" it is important to recognize that cooperation rather than competition is likely to be the most effective way to ensure the safe and responsible development of AI. International collaboration on AI research and governance can help to ensure that the benefits of AI are shared fairly across the world and that AI is used in ways that are aligned with human values.


Ai Dungeon also pitched in:

So  we need to prepare for a global AI arms race, regardless of which country gets to it first, and this can only end well.
There are 2 paths I see, one path is to continue slowing progress, and allowing the CCP to catch up to us, then when problems start to happen we open everything and stop the CCP, and no doubt they will fix all the problems, which will leave the AI in the CCPs hands, no thanks.

The second path is to continue making progress, and winning the race (even if we arent in the lead currently), by the time other countries catch up, we have a solution in place, and when we hit any problems we have the solutions ready to go.
So I say work on a solution, create a global body, and get this ball rolling, and fast.

Lol narrator's response Is hilarious.   


In terms of the cost, it emerges from the cost of running AI. Unfortunately, this technology is still pretty expensive.  
Hovewer, a little over a month ago, it costed more than 10 times more. Then, OpenAI made GPT-3.5-Turbo available at 10% of the cost of previous models keeping the quality the same if not better.  
Stable Diffuion API also got 4 times cheaper recently.

>Is it possible in Dreamio to make your own worlds

You can create your own starting prompts if you scroll down on the prompt selection screen.  


>define races/classes/realms/spells/timed events  
>  
>How much is the AI making use of pyhsical descriptions like skin or eye color, or as example, a tiny height?

All information that the game can work with is visible in the main text window and in the ruleset. If you scroll to the top of the main text window, you'll find summary of previous events and details. If you convince narrator to include certain information in the summary, or if you include it in the ruleset, he will remember it and will keep it in mind.  


>play out erotic content like on AIdungeon?

The game is definitely capable of generating erotic content if you remove or adjust the ruleset, but the problem lies with OpenAI policies, which prohibit sexual content.

Any healthy human child possesses “embodied intelligence” that far eclipses the world’s most sophisticated AI.

That said, I wouldn't necessarily point you at the Author's Note.  I'd remind you that the AI writes in the style of what it's seeing: if you want it to be more descriptive, try forcing it to do so by writing in some description.  You can have it generate descriptions by writing the beginning of what would be a longer description, and letting it finish the sentence for you.

For example, when I came to the gym in Velvet Town in my Pokemon playthrough, I wrote something like...

>I cross through the small park next to the pokemon center, glancing up at the various statues of fairy-type pokemon like mawile and clefable as I pass them. Finally, I walk into the grand hall of the Emerald gym, and I am a bit bedazzled by it. The place is large and grand, with

...and then the AI wrote more, and if it tried to move on before I was done, I forced it to step back by deleting the last part of its response and making it the beginning of more description.  Eventually, it should get the idea that it's describing right now, and with enough of it in the current-context, it'll start to do that as a pattern.

I'll note, if you have Steam-premium, or any subscription, you can use Advanced settings to put the response-length to minimum, giving the AI less opportunity to go off and do something you don't want.","True","False","False","None","None","None","None","0","1682146842.0","2023-04-22-090042","1682146842.0","None","0","False","0","jh8t8mx","False","None","t3_12uf8sp","False","None","None","None","[]","t1_jh8t8mx","False","0","t3_12uf8sp","/r/AIDungeon/comments/12uf8sp/authors_note/jh8t8mx/","None","","[]","1687637801","False","3","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","1691230002","3","[]",""

Can I have some advice please ? 
Im looking for an AI to erp with (nsfw). It should be not too expensive and it should have a good ai so we don’t get confused while chatting. Also I don’t like the aspect of tokens/credits so a monthly subscription would be nice.

I was thinking about Anima. It looked like Replika. I had Replika in the past but now it’s too expensive and the nsfw is gone (I think). Can someone give me advice and maybe help me find the perfect ai for me ?

I enjoy using it but I have never been really impressed by it. Constant retries and edits, many author notes to try and help it do a better job despite the fact that anything I added to the ""world database"" would seem to be completely ignored for the grand scheme of things.

I watched some people stream the highest tier of their AI model and while it did seem more clever, it didn't seem much better at preventing the issues that seem to plague AID no matter what model you're on.

AIDungeon has always seemed to have a severe case of alzheimer's, constantly forgetting what you're doing, where your at, and certainly nearly impossible to hold a consistent conversation between your character and another. Sometimes making you talk to your own character in first person simply forgetting that THAT character is you, even if you have that clearly stated multiple times in your own author notes.

As a test, I tried to move over to NovelAI just 2 days ago, even decided to do the $25 subscription to really test out how it works. (I could easily run it free on my pc but I don't feel like going through that whole elaborate download process and setting it up, possibly incorrectly) Now while it does have some of the same issues as AID, such as text looping, which is easily rectified for both. Sometimes forgetting where your at exactly, IT IS SO MUCH FREAKING BETTER...

I've only used it for 2 days now, I have not even touched their Author's notes, lore book or anything other than just diving right into the story (adventure beta module - basically what AID does, writing stories around your character and actions)

The conversations while not perfect, are so much more consistent with much better language. The AI even actually shows a more consistent understanding of what's going on, where your at, and what you're doing. Again, it's not perfect by a long shot, it does still tend to forget or repeat itself, but not nearly as much as AID. The $25 sub and Euterpe ai model, is so much more consistent than what I've experienced personally with the free version of AID, or seen with the highest tier version of their AI model in multiple videos and livestreams.

And the Krake ai model is supposed to be even better than Euterpe, but I've been so happy with the performance of the Euterpe model that I haven't checked it out yet. So as far as things stand, I would have to 100% recommend NovelAI if you're going to spend money. Not to mention all your stories are stored locally, but can choose to store them on an online server if you choose to.

(Side note: And for all you cultured people (You know who you are), as I stated before it has a much better consistency and understanding. Have fun with that.)

EDIT: Oh, and you can delete large quantities of text all at once without restraint, instead of AIDungeon's microsections of texts. So you can revoke large portions of a story without any issues.

NovelAI while retaining some of the same issues of AID, is much more consistent with a better understanding of events and actions, and has many more outlets to customize how it works. If you're going to spend money on either, as someone with over 300 hours on AID on steam alone, I would 100% recommend NovelAI over AID for the time being.","True","False","False","None","None","None","None","0","1682593406.0","2023-04-27-130326","1682593406.0","None","0","1682893039.0","0","jhwktd7","False","None","t3_11668nr","False","None","None","None","[]","t1_jhwktd7","False","0","t3_11668nr","/r/AIDungeon/comments/11668nr/aidungeon_vs_novelai/jhwktd7/","None","","[]","1687694891","False","1","False","True","False","AIDungeon","t5_29uaei","r/AIDungeon","public","None","0","[]","None","1691448327","1","[]",""

AID isn't really a game or a virtual DM. It's an artificial collaborative storytelling partner. It makes no distinction, in terms of control or ownership, between PCs and NPCs.

What you can do is edit any Actions the AI generates if there's anything in them that you don't like. If it makes your character do something you're not keen on, just cut that out or change it.

You can also Retry the Action for an entirely different output where the AI might have your character do something else or it might just not do anything with your character at all.

Sometimes you get lucky, and it writes something for your character in a good way that you wouldn't have thought of. Those are some very nice moments.

This lack of true ownership over characters goes both ways though.

In this modern-day city, you can create your own character with a variety of customization options.  
First, you'll choose your job from a list of professions ranging from police officer, detective, journalist, and private investigator, to bartender, chef, musician, and more. If you don't see your dream job on the list, you can type it in yourself.  
Next, you'll choose your living area in Arcadia City, which is divided into several districts, each with its own unique atmosphere and culture. There's the posh and glamorous ""Diamond Heights,"" the bohemian and artsy ""Echo Park,"" the historic and traditional ""Old Town,"" and the trendy and hipster ""Eastside,"" to name a few.  
As you start your journey in Arcadia City, you'll encounter a wide range of magical creatures and supernatural beings, from werewolves, vampires, and witches to faeries, ghosts, and demons. Some are friendly and helpful, while others are dangerous and hostile.  
Your job will lead you to interact with various NPCs (non-player characters), including potential romantic partners. Depending on your job and the choices you make, you'll have the chance to develop a romantic relationship with characters such as your partner on the police force, your informant as a journalist, or your regular customer at the bar you work at.  
But be careful, as your choices and actions can have consequences in Arcadia City, and there are various factions and organizations vying for power and control in this supernatural metropolis. You might find yourself embroiled in a magical war, a political intrigue, or a criminal investigation.

If you're using nothing but Say/Do, and keeping your inputs short, that will affect output quality as well.

In addition to its training data, the AI takes the content of your Story into consideration when determining its writing style. So, if you're posting nothing but ""You do this. You say that. You do that other thing."" eventually the AI is going to adapt to that and start writing the same way.

Another thing to watch out for is ending your input in whitespace, particularly in Story mode or when you're using blank input to have the AI do multiple outputs in a row. Expecially with the case of trailing line feeds, whitespace at the end of input can make the bot do weird things.

If you're a subscriber, and you've been messing with the Advanced Settings to fine-tune certain things like randomness and repetition, resetting to defaults is something you should probably try for a bit.

For more real-time assistance in troubleshooting bot behavior, I suggest joining the Discord and posting in #aid-general.

AID moved away from OpenAI as a model provider awhile ago, after dealing with some pretty gnarly shenanigans. The upside is that they've got some better privacy controls in place and more direct control over the models. The downside is that none of the production models are GPT-powered anymore, and GPT is by far an industry leader in Language Model AI.

So, the current models in production aren't putting out near the level of quality that one would expect from something like ChatGPT. But Latitude is continously working to improve that. If your prior experience is from just after the switch away from GPT, I can rather confidently say the models have improved substantially from there.

More recently, they've announced that they are testing a GPT-based model hosted in Azure. You can read some details on that in their blog (link below). It's not in production yet, but users can occasionally get a glimpse of it through the new Try a New AI feature (a subcomponent of Improve The AI/Train The AI). I think everyone who's tried it so far has been quite impressed.

More big changes are on the horizon with a major release, which will include a total UI overhaul, called Phoenix. It was announced on the official Discord earlier this month (link below). A release date hasn't been set, but it's in-work and it seems like they've got big plans.

https://discord.com/channels/903327676884979802/1093296775420457093

Speaking of Discord, Latitude has also announced a bit of a change in their communications philosophy regarding what they have in-work. The announcement of Phoenix, for example, was made in their #dev-notes section which is now dedicated to providing some behind-the-scenes info and previews of changes in consideration and on the horizon.

https://discord.com/channels/903327676884979802/1093291784311943300

If you're interested in keeping up on more updates, or picking the brains of some veteran players, I definitely recommend joining the Discord.
